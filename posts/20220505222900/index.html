select candidate contexts, where traditional sparse vector space models, such
as TF-IDF or BM25, are the de facto method. In this work, we show that
retrieval can be practically implemented using dense representations alone,
where embeddings are learned from a small number of questions and passages by a
simple dual-encoder framework. When evaluated on a wide range of open-domain QA
datasets, our dense retriever outperforms a strong Lucene-BM25 system largely
by 9%-19% absolute in terms of top-20 passage retrieval accuracy, and helps our
end-to-end QA system establish new state-of-the-art on multiple open-domain QA
benchmarks.</p></blockquote><h2 id=whats-new>What&rsquo;s New</h2><ul><li>QAタスクにおいて，追加で事前学習せずにDense Embeddingを学習する方法（Deep Passage Retriever）を提案</li><li>QuestionとPassageを別々にEmbeddingするDual Encoderモデルにおいて，効率的な学習方法を採用</li><li>Deep Passage Retrieverで，既存手法（TF-IDF，BM25）を上回る精度を達成</li><li>上記の観点を複数のQAデータセットで検証</li></ul><h2 id=dataset>Dataset</h2><ul><li>Natural Questions<blockquote><p>Kwiatkowski, T. et al.

Second, we describe Mulder&rsquo;s architecture, which relies on multiple search-engine queries, natural-language parsing, and a novel voting procedure to yield reliable answers coupled with high recall. Finally, we compare Mulder&rsquo;s performance to that of Google and AskJeeves on questions drawn from the TREC-8 question answering track. We find that Mulder&rsquo;s recall is more than a factor of three higher than that of AskJeeves. In addition, we find that Google requires 6.6 times as much user effort to achieve the same level of recall as Mulder.</p></blockquote></details><details><summary>SQuAD: 100,000+ Questions for Machine Comprehension of Text</summary><blockquote><p>Pranav Rajpurkar, Jian Zhang, Konstantin Lopyrev, Percy Liang.

However, previous work trains BERT by viewing passages corresponding to the same question as independent training instances, which may cause incomparable scores for answers from different passages. To tackle this issue, we propose a multi-passage BERT model to globally normalize answer scores across all passages of the same question, and this change enables our QA model find better answers by utilizing more passages. In addition, we find that splitting articles into passages with the length of 100 words by sliding window improves performance by 4%. By leveraging a passage ranker to select high-quality passages, multi-passage BERT gains additional 2%. Experiments on four standard benchmarks showed that our multi-passage BERT outperforms all state-of-the-art models on all benchmarks. In particular, on the OpenSQuAD dataset, our model gains 21.4% EM and 21.5% F1 over all non-BERT models, and 5.8% EM and 6.5% F1 over BERT-based models.</p></blockquote></details><details><summary>Reading Wikipedia to Answer Open-Domain Questions</summary><blockquote><p>Danqi Chen, Adam Fisch, J.

In this paper, we provide a new approach for amortizing the cost of a sequence of related inference queries, such as the ones arising during learning. Our technique relies on a surprising connection with algorithms developed in the past two decades for similarity search in large data bases.

The approach is to take advantage of implicit higher-order structure in the association of terms with documents (“semantic structure”) in order to improve the detection of relevant documents on the basis of terms found in queries. The particular technique used is singular-value decomposition, in which a large term by document matrix is decomposed into a set of ca. 100 orthogonal factors from which the original matrix can be approximated by linear combination. Documents are represented by ca. 100 item vectors of factor weights. Queries are represented as pseudo-document vectors formed from weighted combinations of terms, and documents with supra-threshold cosine values are returned. initial tests find this completely automatic method for retrieval to be promising.</p></blockquote></details><details><summary>Billion-Scale Similarity Search with GPUs</summary><blockquote><p>Jeff Johnson, M.

For example, TriviaQA answers are entities that can be mentioned multiple times in supporting documents, while DROP answers can be computed by deriving many different equations from numbers in the reference text. In this paper, we show it is possible to convert such tasks into discrete latent variable learning problems with a precomputed, task-specific set of possible solutions (e.g. different mentions or equations) that contains one correct option. We then develop a hard EM learning scheme that computes gradients relative to the most likely solution at each update. Despite its simplicity, we show that this approach significantly outperforms previous methods on six QA tasks, including absolute gains of 2–10%, and achieves the state-of-the-art on five of them. Using hard updates instead of maximizing marginal likelihood is key to these results as it encourages the model to find the one correct answer, which we show through detailed qualitative analysis.</p></blockquote></details><details><summary>Poly-encoders: Architectures and Pre-training Strategies for Fast and Accurate Multi-sentence Scoring</summary><blockquote><p>Samuel Humeau, Kurt Shuster, Marie-Anne Lachaux, J.

For tasks that make pairwise comparisons between sequences, matching a given input with a corresponding label, two approaches are common: Cross-encoders performing full self-attention over the pair and Bi-encoders encoding the pair separately. The former often performs better, but is too slow for practical use. In this work, we develop a new transformer architecture, the Poly-encoder, that learns global rather than token level self-attention features. We perform a detailed comparison of all three approaches, including what pre-training and fine-tuning strategies work best. We show our models achieve state-of-the-art results on four tasks; that Poly-encoders are faster than Cross-encoders and more accurate than Bi-encoders; and that the best results are obtained by pre-training on large datasets similar to the downstream tasks.</p></blockquote></details><details><summary>BART: Denoising Sequence-to-Sequence Pre-training for Natural Language Generation, Translation, and Comprehension</summary><blockquote><p>M.

BART is trained by (1) corrupting text with an arbitrary noising function, and (2) learning a model to reconstruct the original text. It uses a standard Tranformer-based neural machine translation architecture which, despite its simplicity, can be seen as generalizing BERT (due to the bidirectional encoder), GPT (with the left-to-right decoder), and other recent pretraining schemes. We evaluate a number of noising approaches, finding the best performance by both randomly shuffling the order of sentences and using a novel in-filling scheme, where spans of text are replaced with a single mask token. BART is particularly effective when fine tuned for text generation but also works well for comprehension tasks. It matches the performance of RoBERTa on GLUE and SQuAD, and achieves new state-of-the-art results on a range of abstractive dialogue, question answering, and summarization tasks, with gains of up to 3.5 ROUGE. BART also provides a 1.1 BLEU increase over a back-translation system for machine translation, with only target language pretraining. We also replicate other pretraining schemes within the BART framework, to understand their effect on end-task performance.</p></blockquote></details><details><summary>Exploring the Limits of Transfer Learning with a Unified Text-to-Text Transformer</summary><blockquote><p>Colin Raffel, Noam M.

Some recent studies consider the retrieval process as maximum inner product search (MIPS) using dense question and paragraph representations, achieving promising results on several information-seeking QA datasets. However, the pretraining of the dense vector representations is highly resource-demanding, e.g., requires a very large batch size and lots of training steps. In this work, we propose a sample-efficient method to pretrain the paragraph encoder. First, instead of using heuristically created pseudo question-paragraph pairs for pretraining, we use an existing pretrained sequence-to-sequence model to build a strong question generator that creates high-quality pretraining data. Second, we propose a simple progressive pretraining algorithm to ensure the existence of effective negative samples in each batch. Across three open-domain QA datasets, our method consistently outperforms a strong dense retrieval baseline that uses 6 times more computation for training. On two of the datasets, our method achieves more than 4-point absolute improvement in terms of answer exact match.</p></blockquote></details><details><summary>The Probabilistic Relevance Framework: BM25 and Beyond</summary><blockquote><p>S.

The task has gained popularity with its natural combination of information retrieval (IR) and machine comprehension (MC). Advancements in representation learning have led to separated progress in both IR and MC; however, very few studies have examined the relationship and combined design of retrieval and comprehension at different levels of granularity, for development of MRS systems. In this work, we give general guidelines on system design for MRS by proposing a simple yet effective pipeline system with special consideration on hierarchical semantic retrieval at both paragraph and sentence level, and their potential effects on the downstream task. The system is evaluated on both fact verification and open-domain multihop QA, achieving state-of-the-art results on the leaderboard test sets of both FEVER and HOTPOTQA. To further demonstrate the importance of semantic retrieval, we present ablation and analysis studies to quantify the contribution of neural retrieval modules at both paragraph-level and sentence-level, and illustrate that intermediate semantic retrieval modules are vital for not only effectively filtering upstream information and thus saving downstream computation, but also for shaping upstream data distribution and providing better data for downstream modeling.</p></blockquote></details><details><summary>Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks</summary><blockquote><p>Patrick Lewis, Ethan Perez, Aleksandara Piktus, Fabio Petroni, Vladimir Karpukhin, Naman Goyal, Heinrich Kuttler, M.

However, their ability to access and precisely manipulate knowledge is still limited, and hence on knowledge-intensive tasks, their performance lags behind task-specific architectures. Additionally, providing provenance for their decisions and updating their world knowledge remain open research problems. Pre-trained models with a differentiable access mechanism to explicit non-parametric memory can overcome this issue, but have so far been only investigated for extractive downstream tasks. We explore a general-purpose fine-tuning recipe for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) &ndash; models which combine pre-trained parametric and non-parametric memory for language generation. We introduce RAG models where the parametric memory is a pre-trained seq2seq model and the non-parametric memory is a dense vector index of Wikipedia, accessed with a pre-trained neural retriever. We compare two RAG formulations, one which conditions on the same retrieved passages across the whole generated sequence, the other can use different passages per token. We fine-tune and evaluate our models on a wide range of knowledge-intensive NLP tasks and set the state-of-the-art on three open domain QA tasks, outperforming parametric seq2seq models and task-specific retrieve-and-extract architectures. For language generation tasks, we find that RAG models generate more specific, diverse and factual language than a state-of-the-art parametric-only seq2seq baseline.</p></blockquote></details><details><summary>ColBERT: Efficient and Effective Passage Search via Contextualized Late Interaction over BERT</summary><blockquote><p>O.

While remarkably effective, the ranking models based on these LMs increase computational cost by orders of magnitude over prior approaches, particularly as they must feed each query-document pair through a massive neural network to compute a single relevance score. To tackle this, we present ColBERT, a novel ranking model that adapts deep LMs (in particular, BERT) for efficient retrieval. ColBERT introduces a late interaction architecture that independently encodes the query and the document using BERT and then employs a cheap yet powerful interaction step that models their fine-grained similarity. By delaying and yet retaining this fine-granular interaction, ColBERT can leverage the expressiveness of deep LMs while simultaneously gaining the ability to pre-compute document representations offline, considerably speeding up query processing. Crucially, ColBERT&rsquo;s pruning-friendly interaction mechanism enables leveraging vector-similarity indexes for end-to-end retrieval directly from millions of documents. We extensively evaluate ColBERT using two recent passage search datasets. Results show that ColBERT&rsquo;s effectiveness is competitive with existing BERT-based models (and outperforms every non-BERT baseline), while executing two orders-of-magnitude faster and requiring up to four orders-of-magnitude fewer FLOPs per query.</p></blockquote></details><details><summary>Learning to rank using gradient descent</summary><blockquote><p>C.

We formally show that the existing Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) framework is insufficient for solving MIPS, and then we extend the existing LSH framework to allow asymmetric hashing schemes. Our proposal is based on an interesting mathematical phenomenon in which inner products, after independent asymmetric transformations, can be converted into the problem of approximate near neighbor search.

However, this knowledge is stored implicitly in the parameters of a neural network, requiring ever-larger networks to cover more facts.
To capture knowledge in a more modular and interpretable way, we augment language model pre-training with a latent knowledge retriever, which allows the model to retrieve and attend over documents from a large corpus such as Wikipedia, used during pre-training, fine-tuning and inference. For the first time, we show how to pre-train such a knowledge retriever in an unsupervised manner, using masked language modeling as the learning signal and backpropagating through a retrieval step that considers millions of documents.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of Retrieval-Augmented Language Model pre-training (REALM) by fine-tuning on the challenging task of Open-domain Question Answering (Open-QA). We compare against state-of-the-art models for both explicit and implicit knowledge storage on three popular Open-QA benchmarks, and find that we outperform all previous methods by a significant margin (4-16% absolute accuracy), while also providing qualitative benefits such as interpretability and modularity.</p></blockquote></details><details><summary>Passage Re-ranking with BERT</summary><blockquote><p>Rodrigo Nogueira, Kyunghyun Cho.

In 2015, the conference was held in Orlando, FL, USA. A number of new areas were introduced this year. The two articles presented in this special issue came from the Deep Learning for Multimedia area and the Emotional and Social Signals in Multimedia area. As usual, a rigorous review process was carried out followed by an intense two-day colocated technical program committee meeting. Selecting the final set of best-paper candidates was a very intense process for all concerned, sparking a lot of debate about how important it is to have best paper candidates that are multimodal and take a fresh perspective on new topics. The following best paper extensions underwent a rigorous review procedure to ensure that the work was sufficiently extended compared to their respective conference paper versions. We thank the anonymous reviewers who helped to ensure the quality of these two extended papers. The first article, “Emotion Recognition During Speech Using Dynamics of Multiple Regions of Face” by Yelin Kim and Emily Mower-Provost, addresses the challenging task of performing automated facial emotion recognition when someone is speaking simultaneously. In this article, the authors exploit the context of the speech to disambiguate facial behavior that is caused by speech production from true expressions of facial emotion. They investigate an unsupervised method of segmenting the facial movements due to speech, demonstrating an improvement in facial-emotion recognition performance on the IEMOCAP and SAVEE datasets. Importantly, they describe the correspondence of their experimental findings in relation to existing emotion perception studies. This work is particularly valuable in the development of more naturalistic human-centered and emotionally aware multimedia interfaces. The second article, “Correspondence Autoencoders for Cross-Modal Retrieval” by Fangxiang Feng, Xiaojie Wang, and Ruifan Li, tackles the task of cross-modal retrieval by using correspondence autoencoder which connects the text and image modality. This enables users to issue text queries and have images retrieved using their shared representations. The authors present three distinct architectures for achieving this. A correspondence cross-modal autoencoder reconstructs its input, which may consist of text phrases or images, while using a shared bottleneck layer (with the text and image belonging to the same entity). In the second variant, the full-modal architecture, both inputs must be reconstructed given a single modality. The final deep architecture employs restricted Boltzmann machines. Experimental results show that the described architectures improve upon previously published literature in this domain on the Wikipedia, Pascal, and NUS-WIDE-10k datasets.

We show for the first time that it is possible to jointly learn the retriever and reader from question-answer string pairs and without any IR system. In this setting, evidence retrieval from all of Wikipedia is treated as a latent variable. Since this is impractical to learn from scratch, we pre-train the retriever with an Inverse Cloze Task. We evaluate on open versions of five QA datasets. On datasets where the questioner already knows the answer, a traditional IR system such as BM25 is sufficient. On datasets where a user is genuinely seeking an answer, we show that learned retrieval is crucial, outperforming BM25 by up to 19 points in exact match.</p></blockquote></details><details><summary>Semantic Parsing on Freebase from Question-Answer Pairs</summary><blockquote><p>Jonathan Berant, A.

Instead of relying on annotated logical forms, which is especially expensive to obtain at large scale, we learn from question-answer pairs. The main challenge in this setting is narrowing down the huge number of possible logical predicates for a given question. We tackle this problem in two ways: First, we build a coarse mapping from phrases to predicates using a knowledge base and a large text corpus. Second, we use a bridging operation to generate additional predicates based on neighboring predicates. On the dataset of Cai and Yates (2013), despite not having annotated logical forms, our system outperforms their state-of-the-art parser. Additionally, we collected a more realistic and challenging dataset of question-answer pairs and improves over a natural baseline.</p></blockquote></details><details><summary>Real-Time Open-Domain Question Answering with Dense-Sparse Phrase Index</summary><blockquote><p>Minjoon Seo, Jinhyuk Lee, T.

In this paper, we introduce query-agnostic indexable representations of document phrases that can drastically speed up open-domain QA. In particular, our dense-sparse phrase encoding effectively captures syntactic, semantic, and lexical information of the phrases and eliminates the pipeline filtering of context documents. Leveraging strategies for optimizing training and inference time, our model can be trained and deployed even in a single 4-GPU server.

They ignore the rich information contained in other paragraphs. Moreover, distant supervision data inevitably accompanies with the wrong labeling problem, and these noisy data will substantially degrade the performance of DS-QA. To address these issues, we propose a novel DS-QA model which employs a paragraph selector to filter out those noisy paragraphs and a paragraph reader to extract the correct answer from those denoised paragraphs.

For tasks that make pairwise comparisons, e.g. matching a given context with a corresponding response, two approaches have permeated the literature. A Cross-encoder performs full self-attention over the pair; a Bi-encoder performs self-attention for each sequence separately, and the final representation is a function of the pair. While Cross-encoders nearly always outperform Bi-encoders on various tasks, both in our work and others&rsquo; (Urbanek et al., 2019), they are orders of magnitude slower, which hampers their ability to perform real-time inference. In this work, we develop a new architecture, the Poly-encoder, that is designed to approach the performance of the Cross-encoder while maintaining reasonable computation time. Additionally, we explore two pretraining schemes with different datasets to determine how these affect the performance on our chosen dialogue tasks: ConvAI2 and DSTC7 Track 1.

Yet the effectiveness of dense retrieval (DR) often requires combination with sparse retrieval. In this paper, we identify that the main bottleneck is in the training mechanisms, where the negative instances used in training are not representative of the irrelevant documents in testing. This paper presents Approximate nearest neighbor Negative Contrastive Estimation (ANCE), a training mechanism that constructs negatives from an Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) index of the corpus, which is parallelly updated with the learning process to select more realistic negative training instances. This fundamentally resolves the discrepancy between the data distribution used in the training and testing of DR. In our experiments, ANCE boosts the BERT-Siamese DR model to outperform all competitive dense and sparse retrieval baselines. It nearly matches the accuracy of sparse-retrieval-and-BERT-reranking using dot-product in the ANCE-learned representation space and provides almost 100x speed-up.</p></blockquote></details><details><summary>Learning a similarity metric discriminatively, with application to face verification</summary><blockquote><p>S.

We propose a novel discriminative training method that projects the raw term vectors into a common, low-dimensional vector space. Our approach operates by finding the optimal matrix to minimize the loss of the pre-selected similarity function (e.g., cosine) of the projected vectors, and is able to efficiently handle a large number of training examples in the high-dimensional space. Evaluated on two very different tasks, cross-lingual document retrieval and ad relevance measure, our method not only outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, but also achieves high accuracy at low dimensions and is thus more efficient.</p></blockquote></details><details><summary>Maximum inner-product search using cone trees</summary><blockquote><p>P.

However, the closely related problem of efficiently finding the best match with respect to the inner-product has never been explored in the general setting to the best of our knowledge. In this paper we consider this problem and contrast it with the previous problems considered. First, we propose a general branch-and-bound algorithm based on a (single) tree data structure. Subsequently, we present a dual-tree algorithm for the case where there are multiple queries. Our proposed branch-and-bound algorithms are based on novel inner-product bounds. Finally we present a new data structure, the cone tree, for increasing the efficiency of the dual-tree algorithm. We evaluate our proposed algorithms on a variety of data sets from various applications, and exhibit up to five orders of magnitude improvement in query time over the naive search technique in some cases.</p></blockquote></details><details><summary>BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding</summary><blockquote><p>Jacob Devlin, Ming-Wei Chang, Kenton Lee, Kristina Toutanova.

Unlike recent language representation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Radford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5 (7.7 point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).</p></blockquote></details><details><summary>Quantization based Fast Inner Product Search</summary><blockquote><p>Ruiqi Guo, Sanjiv Kumar, K.

Each database vector is quantized in multiple subspaces via a set of codebooks, learned directly by minimizing the inner product quantization error. Then, the inner product of a query to a database vector is approximated as the sum of inner products with the subspace quantizers. Different from recently proposed LSH approaches to MIPS, the database vectors and queries do not need to be augmented in a higher dimensional feature space. We also provide a theoretical analysis of the proposed approach, consisting of the concentration results under mild assumptions. Furthermore, if a small sample of example queries is given at the training time, we propose a modified codebook learning procedure which further improves the accuracy. Experimental results on a variety of datasets including those arising from deep neural networks show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art.</p></blockquote></details><details><summary>Multi-step Retriever-Reader Interaction for Scalable Open-domain Question Answering</summary><blockquote><p>R.

The framework is agnostic to the architecture of the machine reading model, only requiring access to the token-level hidden representations of the reader. The retriever uses fast nearest neighbor search to scale to corpora containing millions of paragraphs. A gated recurrent unit updates the query at each step conditioned on the state of the reader and the reformulated query is used to re-rank the paragraphs by the retriever. We conduct analysis and show that iterative interaction helps in retrieving informative paragraphs from the corpus.

TriviaQA includes 95K question-answer pairs authored by trivia enthusiasts and independently gathered evidence documents, six per question on average, that provide high quality distant supervision for answering the questions. We show that, in comparison to other recently introduced large-scale datasets, TriviaQA (1) has relatively complex, compositional questions, (2) has considerable syntactic and lexical variability between questions and corresponding answer-evidence sentences, and (3) requires more cross sentence reasoning to find answers. We also present two baseline algorithms: a feature-based classifier and a state-of-the-art neural network, that performs well on SQuAD reading comprehension. Neither approach comes close to human performance (23% and 40% vs. 80%), suggesting that TriviaQA is a challenging testbed that is worth significant future study.

These approaches have achieved state of the art results in simplified closed-domain settings such as the SQuAD (Rajpurkar et al. 2016) dataset, which provides a preselected passage, from which the answer to a given question may be extracted. More recently, researchers have begun to tackle open-domain QA, in which the model is given a question and access to a large corpus (e.g., wikipedia) instead of a pre-selected passage (Chen et al. 2017a). This setting is more complex as it requires large-scale search for relevant passages by an information retrieval component, combined with a reading comprehension model that “reads” the passages to generate an answer to the question. Performance in this setting lags well behind closed-domain performance. In this paper, we present a novel open-domain QA system called Reinforced Ranker-Reader (R), based on two algorithmic innovations. First, we propose a new pipeline for open-domain QA with a Ranker component, which learns to rank retrieved passages in terms of likelihood of extracting the ground-truth answer to a given question. Second, we propose a novel method that jointly trains the Ranker along with an answer-extraction Reader model, based on reinforcement learning. We report extensive experimental results showing that our method significantly improves on the state of the art for multiple open-domain QA datasets. 2</p></blockquote></details><details><summary>Learning deep structured semantic models for web search using clickthrough data</summary><blockquote><p>Po-Sen Huang, Xiaodong He, Jianfeng Gao, L.

In this study we strive to develop a series of new latent semantic models with a deep structure that project queries and documents into a common low-dimensional space where the relevance of a document given a query is readily computed as the distance between them. The proposed deep structured semantic models are discriminatively trained by maximizing the conditional likelihood of the clicked documents given a query using the clickthrough data. To make our models applicable to large-scale Web search applications, we also use a technique called word hashing, which is shown to effectively scale up our semantic models to handle large vocabularies which are common in such tasks. The new models are evaluated on a Web document ranking task using a real-world data set. Results show that our best model significantly outperforms other latent semantic models, which were considered state-of-the-art in the performance prior to the work presented in this paper.</p></blockquote></details></div><div class="row pl-3 pr-3"><div class="col-md-6 share-buttons"></div></div><hr><div class="row next-prev-navigator"><div class="col-md-6 previous-article"><a href=/blog-akitenkrad/posts/20220503010000/ title="DeBERTa: Decoding-Enhanced BERT with Disentangled Attention" class="btn btn-outline-info"><div><i class="fas fa-chevron-circle-left"></i> Prev</div><div class=next-prev-text>DeBERTa: Decoding-Enhanced BERT with Disentangled Attention</div></a></div><div class="col-md-6 next-article"><a href=/blog-akitenkrad/posts/introduction/ title="Markdown Syntax Guide" class="btn btn-outline-info"><div>Next <i class="fas fa-chevron-circle-right"></i></div><div class=next-prev-text>Markdown Syntax Guide</div></a></div></div><hr></div></div></div><a id=scroll-to-top class=btn><i class="fas fa-chevron-circle-up"></i></a></section><section class=toc-section id=toc-section><div class=toc-holder><h5 class="text-center pl-3">Table of Contents</h5><hr><div class=toc><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#citation>Citation</a></li><li><a href=#abstract>Abstract</a></li><li><a href=#whats-new>What&rsquo;s New</a></li><li><a href=#dataset>Dataset</a></li><li><a href=#model-description>Model Description</a></li><li><a href=#results>Results</a></li><li><a href=#references>References</a></li></ul></nav></div></div></section></div><footer id=footer class="container-fluid text-center align-content-center footer pb-2"><div class="container pt-5"><div class="row text-left"><div class="col-md-4 col-sm-12"><h5>Navigation</h5><ul><li class=nav-item><a class=smooth-scroll href=https://akitenkrad.github.io/blog-akitenkrad/#about>About</a></li><li class=nav-item><a class=smooth-scroll href=https://akitenkrad.github.io/blog-akitenkrad/#recent-posts>Recent Posts</a></li></ul></div><div class="col-md-4 col-sm-12"><h5>Contact me:</h5><ul><li><a href=mailto:contact.to.akitenkrad@gmail.com target=_blank rel=noopener><span><i class="fas fa-envelope"></i></span> <span>contact.to.akitenkrad@gmail.com</span></a></li></ul></div></div></div><hr><div class=container><div class="row text-left"><div class=col-md-4><a id=theme href=https://github.com/hossainemruz/toha target=_blank rel=noopener><img src=/blog-akitenkrad/images/theme-logo_hu8376fd15465fef26ffe66b6bcf0ca686_13669_32x0_resize_box_3.png alt="Toha Theme Logo">
