**ABSTRACT**  
Traffic prediction constitutes a pivotal facet within the purview of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), and the attainment of highly precise predictions holds profound significance for efficacious traffic management. The precision of prevailing deep learning-driven traffic prediction models typically sees an upward trend with a rise in the volume of training data. However, the procurement of comprehensive spatiotemporal datasets for traffic is often fraught with challenges, primarily <b>stemming</b> from the substantial costs associated with data collection and retention. Consequently, developing a model that can achieve accurate predictions and good generalization ability in areas with limited historical traffic data is a challenging problem. It is noteworthy that the rapidly advancing pretrained <b>Large</b> <b>Language</b> <b>Models</b> <b>(LLMs)</b> of recent years have demonstrated exceptional proficiency in cross-modality <b>knowledge</b> <b>transfer</b> and <b>few-shot</b> <b>learning.</b> Recognizing the sequential nature of traffic data, similar to language, we introduce TPLLM, a novel traffic prediction framework leveraging <b>LLMs.</b> In this framework, we construct a sequence embedding layer based on <b>Convolutional</b> <b>Neural</b> <b>Networks</b> <b>(CNNs)</b> and a <b>graph</b> <b>embedding</b> <b>layer</b> based on <b>Graph</b> <b>Convolutional</b> <b>Networks</b> <b>(GCNs)</b> to extract sequence features and spatial features, respectively. These are subsequently integrated to form inputs that are suitable for <b>LLMs.</b> A Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) <b>fine-tuning</b> approach is applied to TPLLM, thereby facilitating efficient learning and minimizing computational demands. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that TPLLM exhibits commendable performance in both full-sample and <b>few-shot</b> <b>prediction</b> scenarios, effectively supporting the development of ITS in regions with scarce historical traffic data.

**ABSTRACT**  
The rapidly increasing capabilities of <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> <b>(LLMs)</b> raise an urgent need to align AI systems with diverse human preferences to simultaneously enhance their usefulness and safety, despite the often conflicting nature of these goals. To address this important problem, a promising approach is to enforce a safety constraint at the <b>fine-tuning</b> stage through a constrained <b>Reinforcement</b> <b>Learning</b> <b>from</b> <b>Human</b> <b>Feedback</b> <b>(RLHF)</b> framework. This approach, however, is computationally expensive and often unstable. In this work, we introduce Constrained DPO (C-DPO), a novel extension of the recently proposed <b>Direct</b> <b>Preference</b> <b>Optimization</b> (DPO) approach for <b>fine-tuning</b> <b>LLMs</b> that is both efficient and lightweight. By integrating dual gradient descent and DPO, our method identifies a nearly optimal trade-off between helpfulness and harmlessness without using <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning.</b> <b>Empirically,</b> <b>our</b> <b>approach</b> provides a safety guarantee to <b>LLMs</b> that is missing in DPO while achieving significantly higher rewards under the same safety constraint compared to a recently proposed safe <b>RLHF</b> approach.

**ABSTRACT**  
Multivariate time series <b>anomaly</b> <b>detection</b> is a crucial problem in many industrial and research applications. Timely detection of anomalies allows, for instance, to prevent defects in manufacturing processes and failures in cyberphysical systems. Deep learning methods are preferred among others for their accuracy and robustness for the analysis of complex multivariate data. However, a key aspect is being able to extract predictions in a timely manner, to accommodate real-time requirements in different applications. In the case of deep learning <b>models,</b> <b>model</b> <b>reduction</b> is extremely important to achieve optimal results in real-time systems with limited time and memory constraints. In this paper, we address this issue by proposing a novel compression method for deep <b>autoencoders</b> that involves three key factors. First, <b>pruning</b> reduces the number of weights, while preventing catastrophic drops in accuracy by means of a fast search process that identifies high sparsity levels. Second, linear and non-linear <b>quantization</b> reduces <b>model</b> <b>complexity</b> by reducing the number of bits for every single weight. The combined contribution of these three aspects allow the <b>model</b> <b>size</b> to be reduced, by removing a subset of the weights <b>(pruning),</b> and decreasing their bit-width <b>(quantization).</b> As a result, the compressed <b>model</b> <b>is</b> faster and easier to adopt in highly constrained hardware environments. Experiments performed on popular multivariate <b>anomaly</b> <b>detection</b> <b>benchmarks,</b> show that our method is capable of achieving significant <b>model</b> <b>compression</b> ratio (between 80% and 95%) without a significant reduction in the <b>anomaly</b> <b>detection</b> performance.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this paper, we take a step towards a deeper understanding of learning from human preferences by systematically comparing the paradigm of <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning</b> <b>from</b> <b>human</b> <b>feedback</b> <b>(RLHF)</b> with the recently proposed paradigm of <b>direct</b> <b>preference</b> <b>optimization</b> (DPO). We focus our attention on the class of loglinear policy parametrization and linear reward functions. In order to compare the two paradigms, we first derive minimax statistical bounds on the suboptimality gap induced by both <b>RLHF</b> and DPO, assuming access to an oracle that exactly solves the optimization problems. We provide a detailed discussion on the relative comparison between the two paradigms, simultaneously taking into account the <b>sample</b> <b>size,</b> policy and reward class dimensions, and the regularization temperature. Moreover, we extend our analysis to the approximate optimization setting and derive exponentially decaying convergence rates for both <b>RLHF</b> and DPO. Next, we analyze the setting where the ground-truth reward is not realizable and find that, while <b>RLHF</b> incurs a constant additional error, DPO retains its asymptotically decaying gap by just tuning the temperature accordingly. Finally, we extend our comparison to the <b>Markov</b> <b>decision</b> <b>process</b> setting, where we generalize our results with exact optimization. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to provide such a comparative analysis for <b>RLHF</b> and DPO.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Scaling</b> <b>laws</b> play an instrumental role in the sustainable improvement in model quality. Unfortunately, <b>recommendation</b> models to date do not exhibit such laws similar to those observed in the domain of <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models,</b> due to the inefficiencies of their upscaling mechanisms. This limitation poses significant challenges in adapting these models to increasingly more complex real-world datasets. In this paper, we propose an effective network architecture based purely on stacked factorization machines, and a synergistic upscaling strategy, collectively dubbed Wukong, to establish a <b>scaling</b> <b>law</b> in the domain of <b>recommendation.</b> Wukong's unique design makes it possible to capture diverse, any-order of interactions simply through taller and wider layers. We conducted extensive evaluations on six public datasets, and our results demonstrate that Wukong consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models quality-wise. Further, we assessed Wukong's scalability on an internal, <b>large-scale</b> <b>dataset.</b> <b>The</b> results show that Wukong retains its superiority in quality over state-of-the-art models, while holding the <b>scaling</b> <b>law</b> across two orders of magnitude in model complexity, extending beyond 100 Gflop or equivalently up to <b>Large</b> <b>Language</b> <b>Model</b> <b>(GPT-3)</b> training compute scale, where prior arts fall short.

**ABSTRACT**  
Distance-based time series <b>anomaly</b> <b>detection</b> methods are prevalent due to their relative non-parametric nature and interpretability. However, the commonly used Euclidean distance is sensitive to noise. While existing works have explored dynamic time warping (DTW) for its robustness, they only support <b>supervised</b> tasks over multivariate time series <b>(MTS),</b> leaving a scarcity of <b>unsupervised</b> methods. In this work, we propose FCM-wDTW, an <b>unsupervised</b> distance metric learning method for <b>anomaly</b> <b>detection</b> over <b>MTS,</b> which encodes raw data into latent space and reveals normal dimension relationships through cluster centers. FCM-wDTW introduces locally weighted DTW into fuzzy C-means <b>clustering</b> and learns the optimal latent space efficiently, enabling <b>anomaly</b> <b>identification</b> via data reconstruction. Experiments with 11 different types of <b>benchmarks</b> demonstrate our method's competitive accuracy and efficiency.

**ABSTRACT**  
Low precision training can significantly reduce the computational overhead of training deep neural networks (DNNs). Though many such techniques exist, cyclic precision training (CPT), which dynamically adjusts precision throughout training according to a cyclic schedule, achieves particularly impressive improvements in training efficiency, while actually improving DNN performance. Existing CPT implementations take common learning rate schedules (e.g., cyclical cosine schedules) and use them for low precision training without adequate comparisons to alternative scheduling options. We define a diverse suite of CPT schedules and analyze their performance across a variety of DNN training regimes, some of which are unexplored in the low precision training literature (e.g., <b>node</b> <b>classification</b> with <b>graph</b> <b>neural</b> <b>networks).</b> From these experiments, we discover alternative CPT schedules that offer further improvements in training efficiency and model performance, as well as derive a set of best practices for choosing CPT schedules. Going further, we find that a correlation exists between model performance and training cost, and that changing the underlying CPT schedule can control the tradeoff between these two variables. To explain the direct correlation between model performance and training cost, we draw a connection between <b>quantized</b> training and critical learning periods, suggesting that aggressive <b>quantization</b> is a form of learning impairment that can permanently damage model performance.

**ABSTRACT**  
Support vector machine (SVM) has achieved many successes in machine learning, especially for a small sample problem. As a famous extension of the traditional SVM, the $\nu$ support vector machine ($\nu$-SVM) has shown outstanding performance due to its great model interpretability. However, it still faces challenges in training overhead for large-scale problems. To address this issue, we propose a safe screening rule with bi-level optimization for $\nu$-SVM (SRBO-$\nu$-SVM) which can screen out inactive samples before training and reduce the computational cost without sacrificing the prediction accuracy. Our SRBO-$\nu$-SVM is strictly deduced by integrating the <b>Karush-Kuhn-Tucker</b> <b>(KKT)</b> conditions, the variational inequalities of convex problems and the $\nu$-property. Furthermore, we develop an efficient dual coordinate descent method (DCDM) to further improve computational speed. Finally, a unified framework for SRBO is proposed to accelerate many SVM-type models, and it is successfully applied to one-class SVM. Experimental results on 6 artificial data sets and 30 <b>benchmark</b> data sets have verified the effectiveness and safety of our proposed methods in <b>supervised</b> and <b>unsupervised</b> tasks.

**ABSTRACT**  
The industry is rich in cases when we are required to make forecasting for large amounts of time series at once. However, we might be in a situation where we can not afford to train a separate model for each of them. Such issue in time series modeling remains without due attention. The remedy for this setting is the establishment of a <b>foundation</b> <b>model.</b> Such a model is expected to work in <b>zero-shot</b> and <b>few-shot</b> regimes. However, what should we take as a training dataset for such kind of model? Witnessing the benefits from the enrichment of NLP datasets with artificially-generated data, we might want to adopt their experience for time series. In contrast to natural language, the process of generation of synthetic time series data is even more favorable because it provides full control of series patterns, time horizons, and number of samples. In this work, we consider the essential question if it is advantageous to train a <b>foundation</b> <b>model</b> on synthetic data or it is better to utilize only a limited number of real-life examples. Our experiments are conducted only for regular time series and speak in favor of leveraging solely the real time series. Moreover, the choice of the proper source dataset strongly influences the performance during inference. When provided access even to a limited quantity of short time series data, employing it within a <b>supervised</b> framework yields more favorable results than training on a larger volume of synthetic data. The code for our experiments is publicly available on Github \url{https://github.com/sb-ai-lab/synthesize_or_not}.

**ABSTRACT**  
Each <b>LLM</b> serving request goes through two phases. The first is prefill which processes the entire input <b>prompt</b> to produce one output token and the second is decode which generates the rest of output tokens, one-at-a-time. Prefill iterations have high latency but saturate GPU compute due to parallel processing of the input <b>prompt.</b> In contrast, decode iterations have low latency but also low compute utilization because a decode iteration processes only a single token per request. This makes batching highly effective for decodes and consequently for overall throughput. However, batching multiple requests leads to an interleaving of prefill and decode iterations which makes it challenging to achieve both high throughput and low latency. We introduce an efficient <b>LLM</b> inference scheduler Sarathi-Serve inspired by the techniques we originally proposed for optimizing throughput in Sarathi. Sarathi-Serve leverages chunked-prefills from Sarathi to create stall-free schedules that can add new requests in a batch without pausing ongoing decodes. Stall-free scheduling unlocks the opportunity to improve throughput with large batch sizes while minimizing the effect of batching on latency. Our evaluation shows that Sarathi-Serve improves serving throughput within desired latency SLOs of <b>Mistral-7B</b> by up to 2.6x on a single A100 GPU and up to 6.9x for <b>Falcon-180B</b> on 8 A100 GPUs over Orca and vLLM.

**ABSTRACT**  
Human trajectory data produced by daily mobile devices has proven its usefulness in various substantial fields such as urban planning and epidemic prevention. In terms of the individual privacy concern, human trajectory <b>simulation</b> has attracted increasing attention from researchers, targeting at offering numerous realistic mobility data for downstream tasks. Nevertheless, the prevalent issue of data scarcity undoubtedly degrades the reliability of existing deep learning models. In this paper, we are motivated to explore the intriguing problem of mobility transfer across cities, grasping the universal patterns of human trajectories to augment the powerful <b>Transformer</b> with external mobility data. There are two crucial challenges arising in the <b>knowledge</b> <b>transfer</b> across cities: 1) how to transfer the <b>Transformer</b> to adapt for domain heterogeneity; 2) how to calibrate the <b>Transformer</b> to adapt for subtly different long-tail frequency distributions of locations. To address these challenges, we have tailored a Cross-city mObiLity <b>trAnsformer</b> (COLA) with a dedicated model-agnostic transfer framework by effectively transferring cross-city <b>knowledge</b> <b>for</b> human trajectory <b>simulation.</b> Firstly, COLA divides the <b>Transformer</b> into the private modules for city-specific characteristics and the shared modules for city-universal mobility patterns. Secondly, COLA leverages a lightweight yet effective post-hoc adjustment strategy for trajectory <b>simulation,</b> without disturbing the complex bi-level optimization of model-agnostic <b>knowledge</b> <b>transfer.</b> Extensive experiments of COLA compared to state-of-the-art single-city baselines and our implemented cross-city baselines have demonstrated its superiority and effectiveness. The code is available at https://github.com/Star607/Cross-city-Mobility-Transformer.

**ABSTRACT**  
Spatiotemporal (ST) learning has become a crucial technique to enable smart cities and sustainable urban development. Current ST learning models capture the heterogeneity via various spatial <b>convolution</b> and temporal evolution blocks. However, rapid urbanization leads to fluctuating distributions in urban data and city structures over short periods, resulting in existing methods suffering generalization and data adaptation issues. Despite efforts, existing methods fail to deal with newly arrived observations and those methods with generalization capacity are limited in repeated training. Motivated by complementary learning in neuroscience, we introduce a <b>prompt-based</b> complementary spatiotemporal learning termed ComS2T, to empower the evolution of models for data adaptation. ComS2T partitions the neural architecture into a stable neocortex for consolidating historical memory and a dynamic hippocampus for new knowledge update. We first disentangle two disjoint structures into stable and dynamic weights, and then train spatial and temporal <b>prompts</b> by characterizing distribution of main observations to enable <b>prompts</b> adaptive to new data. This data-adaptive <b>prompt</b> mechanism, combined with a two-stage training process, facilitates <b>fine-tuning</b> of the neural architecture conditioned on <b>prompts,</b> thereby enabling efficient adaptation during testing. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of ComS2T in adapting to various spatiotemporal <b>out-of-distribution</b> scenarios while maintaining efficient inference capabilities.

**ABSTRACT**  
Multi-sensor fusion systems (MSFs) play a vital role as the perception module in modern autonomous vehicles (AVs). Therefore, ensuring their robustness against common and realistic adversarial semantic transformations, such as rotation and shifting in the physical world, is crucial for the safety of AVs. While empirical evidence suggests that MSFs exhibit improved robustness compared to single-modal models, they are still vulnerable to adversarial semantic transformations. Despite the proposal of empirical defenses, several works show that these defenses can be attacked again by new adaptive attacks. So far, there is no certified defense proposed for MSFs. In this work, we propose the first robustness certification framework COMMIT certify robustness of multi-sensor fusion systems against semantic attacks. In particular, we propose a practical anisotropic noise mechanism that leverages randomized smoothing with <b>multi-modal</b> data and performs a grid-based splitting method to characterize complex semantic transformations. We also propose efficient algorithms to compute the certification in terms of <b>object</b> <b>detection</b> accuracy and IoU for large-scale MSF models. Empirically, we evaluate the efficacy of COMMIT in different settings and provide a comprehensive <b>benchmark</b> of certified robustness for different MSF models using the CARLA <b>simulation</b> platform. We show that the certification for MSF models is at most 48.39% higher than that of single-modal models, which validates the advantages of MSF models. We believe our certification framework and <b>benchmark</b> will contribute an important step towards certifiably robust AVs in practice.

**ABSTRACT**  
Health acoustic sounds such as coughs and breaths are known to contain useful health signals with significant potential for monitoring health and disease, yet are underexplored in the medical machine learning community. The existing deep learning systems for health acoustics are often narrowly trained and evaluated on a single task, which is limited by data and may hinder generalization to other tasks. To mitigate these gaps, we develop HeAR, a scalable <b>self-supervised</b> <b>learning-based</b> deep learning system using masked <b>autoencoders</b> trained on a large dataset of 313 million two-second long audio clips. Through linear probes, we establish HeAR as a state-of-the-art health audio embedding model on a <b>benchmark</b> of 33 health acoustic tasks across 6 datasets. By introducing this work, we hope to enable and accelerate further health acoustics research.

<b>Federated</b> <b>learning</b> (FL), introduced in 2017, facilitates collaborative learning between non-trusting parties with no need for the parties to explicitly share their data among themselves. This allows training models on user data while respecting privacy regulations such as GDPR and CPRA. However, emerging privacy requirements may mandate model owners to be able to \emph{forget} some learned data, e.g., when requested by data owners or law enforcement. This has given birth to an active field of research called \emph{machine unlearning}. In the context of FL, many techniques developed for unlearning in centralized settings are not trivially applicable! This is due to the unique differences between centralized and distributed learning, in particular, interactivity, stochasticity, heterogeneity, and limited accessibility in FL. In response, a recent line of work has focused on developing unlearning mechanisms tailored to FL. This SoK paper aims to take a deep look at the \emph{federated unlearning} literature, with the goal of identifying research trends and challenges in this emerging field. By carefully categorizing papers published on FL unlearning (since 2020), we aim to pinpoint the unique complexities of <b>federated</b> <b>unlearning,</b> highlighting limitations on directly applying centralized unlearning methods. We compare existing <b>federated</b> <b>unlearning</b> methods regarding influence removal and performance recovery, compare their threat models and assumptions, and discuss their implications and limitations. For instance, we analyze the experimental setup of FL unlearning studies from various perspectives, including data heterogeneity and its <b>simulation,</b> the datasets used for demonstration, and evaluation metrics. Our work aims to offer insights and suggestions for future research on <b>federated</b> <b>unlearning.</b>

**ABSTRACT**  
Many recent state-of-the-art results in language tasks were achieved using compound systems that perform multiple <b>Large</b> <b>Language</b> <b>Model</b> <b>(LLM)</b> calls and aggregate their responses. However, there is little understanding of how the number of <b>LLM</b> calls -- e.g., when asking the <b>LLM</b> to answer each question multiple times and taking a consensus -- affects such a compound system's performance. In this paper, we initiate the study of <b>scaling</b> <b>laws</b> of compound inference systems. We analyze, theoretically and empirically, how the number of <b>LLM</b> calls affects the performance of one-layer Voting Inference Systems -- one of the simplest compound systems, which aggregates <b>LLM</b> responses via majority voting. We find empirically that across multiple language tasks, surprisingly, Voting Inference Systems' performance first increases but then decreases as a function of the number of <b>LLM</b> calls. Our theoretical results suggest that this non-monotonicity is due to the diversity of query difficulties within a task: more <b>LLM</b> calls lead to higher performance on "easy" queries, but lower performance on "hard" queries, and non-monotone behavior emerges when a task contains both types of queries. This insight then allows us to compute, from a small number of samples, the number of <b>LLM</b> calls that maximizes system performance, and define a <b>scaling</b> <b>law</b> of Voting Inference Systems. Experiments show that our <b>scaling</b> <b>law</b> can predict the performance of Voting Inference Systems and find the optimal number of <b>LLM</b> calls to make.

**ABSTRACT**  
Masked image modeling (MIM), which predicts randomly masked patches from unmasked ones, has emerged as a promising approach in <b>self-supervised</b> <b>vision</b> pretraining. However, the theoretical understanding of MIM is rather limited, especially with the foundational architecture of <b>transformers.</b> In this paper, to the best of our knowledge, we provide the first end-to-end theory of learning one-layer <b>transformers</b> with softmax attention in MIM <b>self-supervised</b> <b>pretraining.</b> On the conceptual side, we posit a theoretical mechanism of how <b>transformers,</b> pretrained with MIM, produce empirically observed local and diverse attention patterns on data distributions with spatial structures that highlight feature-position correlations. On the technical side, our end-to-end analysis of the training dynamics of softmax-based <b>transformers</b> accommodates both input and position embeddings simultaneously, which is developed based on a novel approach to track the interplay between the attention of feature-position and position-wise correlations.

**ABSTRACT**  
Modern deep learning (DL) models necessitate the employment of scaling and compression techniques for effective deployment in resource-constrained environments. Most existing techniques, such as <b>pruning</b> and <b>quantization</b> are generally static. On the other hand, dynamic compression methods, such as early exits, reduce complexity by recognizing the difficulty of input samples and allocating computation as needed. Dynamic methods, despite their superior flexibility and potential for co-existing with static methods, pose significant challenges in terms of implementation due to any changes in dynamic parts will influence subsequent processes. Moreover, most current dynamic compression designs are monolithic and tightly integrated with base models, thereby complicating the adaptation to novel base models. This paper introduces DyCE, an dynamic configurable early-exit framework that decouples design considerations from each other and from the base model. Utilizing this framework, various types and positions of exits can be organized according to predefined configurations, which can be dynamically switched in real-time to accommodate evolving performance-complexity requirements. We also propose techniques for generating optimized configurations based on any desired trade-off between performance and computational complexity. This empowers future researchers to focus on the improvement of individual exits without latent compromise of overall system performance. The efficacy of this approach is demonstrated through image classification tasks with deep <b>CNNs.</b> DyCE significantly reduces the computational complexity by 23.5% of ResNet152 and 25.9% of ConvNextv2-tiny on ImageNet, with accuracy reductions of less than 0.5%. Furthermore, DyCE offers advantages over existing dynamic methods in terms of real-time configuration and fine-grained performance tuning.

**ABSTRACT**  
Residential buildings account for a significant portion (35\%) of the total electricity consumption in the U.S. as of 2022. As more distributed energy resources are installed in buildings, their potential to provide flexibility to the grid increases. To tap into that flexibility provided by buildings, aggregators or system operators need to quantify and forecast flexibility. Previous works in this area primarily focused on commercial buildings, with little work on residential buildings. To address the gap, this paper first proposes two complementary flexibility metrics (i.e., power and energy flexibility) and then investigates several mainstream machine learning-based models for predicting the time-variant and sporadic flexibility of residential buildings at four-hour and 24-hour forecast horizons. The <b>long-short-term-memory</b> <b>(LSTM)</b> <b>model</b> <b>achieves</b> the best performance and can predict power flexibility for up to 24 hours ahead with the average error around 0.7 kW. However, for energy flexibility, the <b>LSTM</b> model is only successful for loads with consistent operational patterns throughout the year and faces challenges when predicting energy flexibility associated with HVAC systems.

**ABSTRACT**  
Despite the success of the carefully-annotated <b>benchmarks,</b> the effectiveness of existing <b>graph</b> <b>neural</b> <b>networks</b> <b>(GNNs)</b> can be considerably impaired in practice when the real-world <b>graph</b> <b>data</b> <b>is</b> noisily labeled. Previous explorations in sample selection have been demonstrated as an effective way for robust learning with noisy labels, however, the conventional studies focus on i.i.d data, and when moving to non-iid <b>graph</b> <b>data</b> <b>and</b> <b>GNNs,</b> two notable challenges remain: (1) nodes located near topological class boundaries are very informative for classification but cannot be successfully distinguished by the heuristic sample selection. (2) there is no available measure that considers the <b>graph</b> <b>topological</b> <b>information</b> to promote sample selection in a <b>graph.</b> <b>To</b> <b>address</b> this dilemma, we propose a $\textit{Topological Sample Selection}$ (TSS) method that boosts the informative sample selection process in a <b>graph</b> <b>by</b> <b>utilising</b> topological information. We theoretically prove that our procedure minimizes an upper bound of the expected risk under target clean distribution, and experimentally show the superiority of our method compared with state-of-the-art baselines.

**ABSTRACT**  
We introduce a notion of distance between <b>supervised</b> <b>learning</b> problems, which we call the Risk distance. This optimal-transport-inspired distance facilitates stability results; one can quantify how seriously issues like sampling bias, noise, limited data, and approximations might change a given problem by bounding how much these modifications can move the problem under the Risk distance. With the distance established, we explore the <b>geometry</b> of the resulting space of <b>supervised</b> <b>learning</b> problems, providing explicit geodesics and proving that the set of classification problems is dense in a larger class of problems. We also provide two variants of the Risk distance: one that incorporates specified weights on a problem's predictors, and one that is more sensitive to the contours of a problem's risk landscape.

**ABSTRACT**  
Predictor-based methods have substantially enhanced Neural Architecture Search (NAS) optimization. The efficacy of these predictors is largely influenced by the method of encoding neural network architectures. While traditional encodings used an adjacency matrix describing the <b>graph</b> structure of a neural network, novel encodings embrace a variety of approaches from <b>unsupervised</b> pretraining of latent representations to vectors of zero-cost proxies. In this paper, we categorize and investigate neural encodings from three main types: structural, learned, and score-based. Furthermore, we extend these encodings and introduce \textit{unified encodings}, that extend NAS predictors to multiple search spaces. Our analysis draws from experiments conducted on over 1.5 million neural network architectures on NAS spaces such as NASBench-101 (NB101), NB201, NB301, Network Design Spaces (NDS), and TransNASBench-101. Building on our study, we present our predictor \textbf{FLAN}: \textbf{Fl}ow \textbf{A}ttention for \textbf{N}AS. FLAN integrates critical insights on predictor design, <b>transfer</b> <b>learning,</b> and \textit{unified encodings} to enable more than an order of magnitude cost reduction for training NAS accuracy predictors. Our implementation and encodings for all neural networks are open-sourced at \href{https://github.com/abdelfattah-lab/flan_nas}{https://github.com/abdelfattah-lab/flan\_nas}.

**ABSTRACT**  
Real-world datasets commonly exhibit noisy labels and class imbalance, such as long-tailed distributions. While previous research addresses this issue by differentiating noisy and clean samples, reliance on information from predictions based on noisy long-tailed data introduces potential errors. To overcome the limitations of prior works, we introduce an effective two-stage approach by combining soft-label refurbishing with multi-expert ensemble learning. In the first stage of robust soft label refurbishing, we acquire unbiased features through <b>contrastive</b> <b>learning,</b> making preliminary predictions using a classifier trained with a carefully designed BAlanced <b>Noise-tolerant</b> Cross-entropy (BANC) loss. In the second stage, our label refurbishment method is applied to obtain soft labels for multi-expert ensemble learning, providing a principled solution to the long-tail noisy label problem. Experiments conducted across multiple <b>benchmarks</b> validate the superiority of our approach, Label Refurbishment considering Label Rarity (LR^2), achieving remarkable accuracies of 94.19% and 77.05% on simulated noisy CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 long-tail datasets, as well as 77.74% and 81.40% on real-noise long-tail datasets, Food-101N and Animal-10N, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Out-of-distribution</b> (OOD) generalization in the <b>graph</b> domain is challenging due to complex <b>distribution</b> <b>shifts</b> and a lack of environmental contexts. Recent methods attempt to enhance <b>graph</b> OOD generalization by generating flat environments. However, such flat environments come with inherent limitations to capture more complex data <b>distributions.</b> <b>Considering</b> the DrugOOD dataset, which contains diverse training environments (e.g., scaffold, size, etc.), flat contexts cannot sufficiently address its high heterogeneity. Thus, a new challenge is posed to generate more semantically enriched environments to enhance <b>graph</b> invariant learning for handling <b>distribution</b> <b>shifts.</b> In this paper, we propose a novel approach to generate hierarchical semantic environments for each <b>graph.</b> Firstly, given an input <b>graph,</b> we explicitly extract variant subgraphs from the input <b>graph</b> to generate proxy predictions on local environments. Then, stochastic attention mechanisms are employed to re-extract the subgraphs for regenerating global environments in a hierarchical manner. In addition, we introduce a new learning objective that guides our model to learn the diversity of environments within the same hierarchy while maintaining consistency across different hierarchies. This approach enables our model to consider the relationships between environments and facilitates robust <b>graph</b> invariant learning. Extensive experiments on real-world <b>graph</b> data have demonstrated the effectiveness of our framework. Particularly, in the challenging dataset DrugOOD, our method achieves up to 1.29\% and 2.83\% improvement over the best baselines on IC50 and EC50 prediction tasks, respectively.

**ABSTRACT**  
The isometric mapping method employs the shortest path algorithm to estimate the Euclidean distance between points on High dimensional (HD) manifolds. This may not be sufficient for weakly uniformed HD data as it could lead to overestimating distances between far neighboring points, resulting in inconsistencies between the intrinsic (local) and extrinsic (global) distances during the projection. To address this issue, we modify the shortest path algorithm by adding a novel constraint inspired by the Parzen-Rosenblatt (PR) window, which helps to maintain the uniformity of the constructed shortest-path <b>graph</b> in Isomap. Multiple imaging datasets overall of 72,236 cases, 70,000 MINST data, 1596 from multiple Chest-XRay pneumonia datasets, and three NSCLC CT/PET datasets with a total of 640 lung cancer patients, were used to <b>benchmark</b> and validate PR-Isomap. 431 imaging biomarkers were extracted from each modality. Our results indicate that PR-Isomap projects HD attributes into a lower-dimensional (LD) space while preserving information, visualized by the <b>MNIST</b> dataset indicating the maintaining local and global distances. PR-Isomap achieved the highest comparative accuracies of 80.9% (STD:5.8) for pneumonia and 78.5% (STD:4.4), 88.4% (STD:1.4), and 61.4% (STD:11.4) for three NSCLC datasets, with a confidence interval of 95% for outcome prediction. Similarly, the multivariate Cox model showed higher overall survival, measured with c-statistics and log-likelihood test, of PR-Isomap compared to other dimensionality reduction methods. Kaplan Meier survival curve also signifies the notable ability of PR-Isomap to distinguish between high-risk and low-risk patients using <b>multimodal</b> imaging biomarkers preserving HD imaging characteristics for precision medicine.

**ABSTRACT**  
Efficient deployment of neural networks (NN) requires the co-optimization of accuracy and latency. For example, hardware-aware neural architecture search has been used to automatically find NN architectures that satisfy a latency constraint on a specific hardware device. Central to these search algorithms is a prediction model that is designed to provide a hardware latency estimate for a candidate NN architecture. Recent research has shown that the sample efficiency of these predictive models can be greatly improved through pre-training on some \textit{training} devices with many samples, and then transferring the predictor on the \textit{test} (target) device. <b>Transfer</b> <b>learning</b> and <b>meta-learning</b> <b>methods</b> have been used for this, but often exhibit significant performance variability. Additionally, the evaluation of existing latency predictors has been largely done on hand-crafted training/test device sets, making it difficult to ascertain design features that compose a robust and general latency predictor. To address these issues, we introduce a comprehensive suite of latency prediction tasks obtained in a principled way through automated partitioning of hardware device sets. We then design a general latency predictor to comprehensively study (1) the predictor architecture, (2) NN sample selection methods, (3) hardware device representations, and (4) NN operation encoding schemes. Building on conclusions from our study, we present an end-to-end latency predictor training strategy that outperforms existing methods on 11 out of 12 difficult latency prediction tasks, improving latency prediction by 22.5\% on average, and up to to 87.6\% on the hardest tasks. Focusing on latency prediction, our HW-Aware NAS reports a $5.8\times$ speedup in wall-clock time.

**ABSTRACT**  
Accurate representations of unknown and sub-grid physical processes through parameterizations (or closure) in numerical <b>simulations</b> with quantified uncertainty are critical for resolving the coarse-grained partial differential equations that govern many problems ranging from weather and climate prediction to turbulence <b>simulations.</b> Recent advances have seen machine learning (ML) increasingly applied to model these subgrid processes, resulting in the development of hybrid physics-ML models through the integration with numerical solvers. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for the joint estimation and uncertainty quantification of physical parameters and machine learning parameterizations in tandem, leveraging differentiable programming. Achieved through online training and efficient Bayesian inference within a high-dimensional parameter space, this approach is enabled by the capabilities of differentiable programming. This proof of concept underscores the substantial potential of differentiable programming in synergistically combining machine learning with differential equations, thereby enhancing the capabilities of hybrid physics-ML modeling.

**ABSTRACT**  
Machine learning models, while progressively advanced, rely heavily on the IID assumption, which is often unfulfilled in practice due to inevitable <b>distribution</b> <b>shifts.</b> This renders them susceptible and untrustworthy for deployment in risk-sensitive applications. Such a significant problem has consequently spawned various branches of works dedicated to developing algorithms capable of <b>Out-of-Distribution</b> (OOD) generalization. Despite these efforts, much less attention has been paid to the evaluation of OOD generalization, which is also a complex and fundamental problem. Its goal is not only to assess whether a model's OOD generalization capability is strong or not, but also to evaluate where a model generalizes well or poorly. This entails characterizing the types of <b>distribution</b> <b>shifts</b> that a model can effectively address, and identifying the safe and risky input regions given a model. This paper serves as the first effort to conduct a comprehensive review of OOD evaluation. We categorize existing research into three paradigms: OOD performance testing, OOD performance prediction, and OOD intrinsic property characterization, according to the availability of test data. Additionally, we briefly discuss OOD evaluation in the context of pretrained models. In closing, we propose several promising directions for future research in OOD evaluation.

**ABSTRACT**  
As machine learning (ML) algorithms get deployed in an ever-increasing number of applications, these algorithms need to achieve better trade-offs between high accuracy, high throughput and low latency. This paper introduces NASH, a novel approach that applies neural architecture search to machine learning hardware. Using NASH, hardware designs can achieve not only high throughput and low latency but also superior accuracy performance. We present four versions of the NASH strategy in this paper, all of which show higher accuracy than the original models. The strategy can be applied to various <b>convolutional</b> <b>neural</b> <b>networks,</b> selecting specific model operations among many to guide the training process toward higher accuracy. Experimental results show that applying NASH on ResNet18 or ResNet34 achieves a top 1 accuracy increase of up to 3.1% and a top 5 accuracy increase of up to 2.2% compared to the non-NASH version when tested on the ImageNet data set. We also integrated this approach into the FINN hardware model synthesis tool to automate the application of our approach and the generation of the hardware model. Results show that using FINN can achieve a maximum throughput of 324.5 fps. In addition, NASH models can also result in a better trade-off between accuracy and hardware resource utilization. The accuracy-hardware (HW) Pareto curve shows that the models with the four NASH versions represent the best trade-offs achieving the highest accuracy for a given HW utilization. The code for our implementation is open-source and publicly available on GitHub at https://github.com/MFJI/NASH.

**ABSTRACT**  
Denoising diffusion <b>probabilistic</b> <b>models</b> (DDPMs) are becoming the leading paradigm for generative models. It has recently shown breakthroughs in audio synthesis, time series imputation and forecasting. In this paper, we propose Diffusion-TS, a novel diffusion-based framework that generates multivariate time series samples of high quality by using an encoder-decoder <b>transformer</b> with disentangled temporal representations, in which the decomposition technique guides Diffusion-TS to capture the semantic meaning of time series while <b>transformers</b> mine detailed sequential information from the noisy model input. Different from existing diffusion-based approaches, we train the model to directly reconstruct the sample instead of the noise in each diffusion step, combining a Fourier-based loss term. Diffusion-TS is expected to generate time series satisfying both interpretablity and realness. In addition, it is shown that the proposed Diffusion-TS can be easily extended to conditional generation tasks, such as forecasting and imputation, without any model changes. This also motivates us to further explore the performance of Diffusion-TS under irregular settings. Finally, through qualitative and quantitative experiments, results show that Diffusion-TS achieves the state-of-the-art results on various realistic analyses of time series.

**ABSTRACT**  
Regional solar power forecasting, which involves predicting the total power generation from all rooftop photovoltaic systems in a region holds significant importance for various stakeholders in the energy sector. However, the vast amount of solar power generation and weather time series from geographically dispersed locations that need to be considered in the forecasting process makes accurate regional forecasting challenging. Therefore, previous work has limited the focus to either forecasting a single time series (i.e., aggregated time series) which is the addition of all solar generation time series in a region, disregarding the location-specific weather effects or forecasting solar generation time series of each PV site (i.e., individual time series) independently using location-specific weather data, resulting in a large number of forecasting models. In this work, we propose two deep-learning-based regional forecasting methods that can effectively leverage both types of time series (aggregated and individual) with weather data in a region. We propose two hierarchical temporal <b>convolutional</b> <b>neural</b> <b>network</b> architectures (HTCNN) and two strategies to adapt HTCNNs for regional solar power forecasting. At first, we explore generating a regional forecast using a single HTCNN. Next, we divide the region into multiple sub-regions based on weather information and train separate HTCNNs for each sub-region; the forecasts of each sub-region are then added to generate a regional forecast. The proposed work is evaluated using a large dataset collected over a year from 101 locations across Western Australia to provide a day ahead forecast. We compare our approaches with well-known alternative methods and show that the sub-region HTCNN requires fewer individual networks and achieves a forecast skill score of 40.2% reducing a statistically significant error by 6.5% compared to the best counterpart.

**ABSTRACT**  
Machine learning (ML) is vulnerable to inference (e.g., membership inference, property inference, and data reconstruction) attacks that aim to infer the private information of training data or dataset. Existing defenses are only designed for one specific type of attack and sacrifice significant utility or are soon broken by adaptive attacks. We address these limitations by proposing an information-theoretic defense framework, called Inf2Guard, against the three major types of inference attacks. Our framework, inspired by the success of <b>representation</b> <b>learning,</b> posits that learning shared <b>representations</b> <b>not</b> only saves time/costs but also benefits numerous downstream tasks. Generally, Inf2Guard involves two <b>mutual</b> <b>information</b> objectives, for privacy protection and utility preservation, respectively. Inf2Guard exhibits many merits: it facilitates the design of customized objectives against the specific inference attack; it provides a general defense framework which can treat certain existing defenses as special cases; and importantly, it aids in deriving theoretical results, e.g., inherent utility-privacy tradeoff and guaranteed privacy leakage. Extensive evaluations validate the effectiveness of Inf2Guard for learning privacy-preserving <b>representations</b> <b>against</b> inference attacks and demonstrate the superiority over the baselines.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Federated</b> <b>learning,</b> as a promising distributed learning paradigm, enables collaborative training of a global model across multiple network edge clients without the need for central data collecting. However, the heterogeneity of edge data distribution drags the model towards the local minima, which can be distant from the global optimum. Such heterogeneity often leads to slow convergence and substantial communication overhead. To address these issues, we propose a novel <b>federated</b> <b>learning</b> framework called FedCMD, a model decoupling tailored to the Cloud-edge supported <b>federated</b> <b>learning</b> that separates deep neural networks into a body for capturing shared representations in Cloud and a personalized head for migrating data heterogeneity. Our motivation is that, by the deep investigation of the performance of selecting different neural network layers as the personalized head, we found rigidly assigning the last layer as the personalized head in current studies is not always optimal. Instead, it is necessary to dynamically select the personalized layer that maximizes the training performance by taking the representation difference between neighbor layers into account. To find the optimal personalized layer, we utilize the low-dimensional representation of each layer to contrast feature distribution transfer and introduce a Wasserstein-based layer selection method, aimed at identifying the best-match layer for personalization. Additionally, a weighted global aggregation algorithm is proposed based on the selected personalized layer for the practical application of FedCMD. Extensive experiments on ten <b>benchmarks</b> demonstrate the efficiency and superior performance of our solution compared with nine state-of-the-art solutions. All code and results are available at https://github.com/elegy112138/FedCMD.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper presents a novel application of <b>explainable</b> <b>AI</b> (XAI) for root-causing performance degradation in machine learning models that learn continuously from user engagement data. In such systems a single feature corruption can cause cascading feature, label and concept drifts. We have successfully applied this technique to improve the reliability of models used in personalized advertising. Performance degradation in such systems manifest as prediction anomalies in the models. These models are typically trained continuously using features that are produced by hundreds of real time data processing pipelines or derived from other upstream models. A failure in any of these pipelines or an instability in any of the upstream models can cause feature corruption, causing the model's predicted output to deviate from the actual output and the training data to become corrupted. The causal relationship between the features and the predicted output is complex, and root-causing is challenging due to the scale and dynamism of the system. We demonstrate how temporal shifts in the global feature importance distribution can effectively isolate the cause of a prediction anomaly, with better recall than model-to-feature correlation methods. The technique appears to be effective even when approximating the local feature importance using a simple perturbation-based method, and aggregating over a few thousand examples. We have found this technique to be a model-agnostic, cheap and effective way to monitor complex data pipelines in production and have deployed a system for continuously analyzing the global feature importance distribution of continuously trained models.

**ABSTRACT**  
Efficient <b>continual</b> <b>learning</b> techniques have been a topic of significant research over the last few years. A fundamental problem with such learning is severe degradation of performance on previously learned tasks, known also as catastrophic forgetting. This paper introduces a novel method to reduce catastrophic forgetting in the context of incremental class learning called Gradient Correlation Subspace Learning (GCSL). The method detects a subspace of the weights that is least affected by previous tasks and projects the weights to train for the new task into said subspace. The method can be applied to one or more layers of a given network architectures and the size of the subspace used can be altered from layer to layer and task to task. Code will be available at \href{https://github.com/vgthengane/GCSL}{https://github.com/vgthengane/GCSL}

**ABSTRACT**  
Our understanding of the generalization capabilities of neural networks (NNs) is still incomplete. Prevailing explanations are based on implicit biases of gradient descent (GD) but they cannot account for the capabilities of models from gradient-free methods nor the simplicity bias recently observed in untrained networks. This paper seeks other sources of generalization in NNs. Findings. To understand the inductive biases provided by architectures independently from GD, we examine untrained, random-weight networks. Even simple MLPs show strong inductive biases: uniform sampling in weight space yields a very biased distribution of functions in terms of complexity. But unlike common wisdom, NNs do not have an inherent "simplicity bias". This property depends on components such as ReLUs, residual connections, and layer normalizations. Alternative architectures can be built with a bias for any level of complexity. <b>Transformers</b> also inherit all these properties from their building blocks. Implications. We provide a fresh explanation for the success of deep learning independent from gradient-based training. It points at promising avenues for controlling the solutions implemented by trained models.

**ABSTRACT**  
We propose a novel approach to the problem of <b>mutual</b> <b>information</b> (MI) estimation via introducing normalizing flows-based estimator. The estimator maps original data to the target distribution with known closed-form expression for MI. We demonstrate that our approach yields MI estimates for the original data. Experiments with high-dimensional data are provided to show the advantages of the proposed estimator.

**ABSTRACT**  
Value-based <b>Reinforcement</b> <b>Learning</b> (RL) methods rely on the application of the Bellman operator, which needs to be approximated from samples. Most approaches consist of an iterative scheme alternating the application of the Bellman operator and a subsequent projection step onto a considered function space. However, we observe that these algorithms can be improved by considering multiple iterations of the Bellman operator at once. Thus, we introduce iterated $Q$-Networks (iQN), a novel approach that learns a sequence of $Q$-function approximations where each $Q$-function serves as the target for the next one in a chain of consecutive Bellman iterations. We demonstrate that iQN is theoretically sound and show how it can be seamlessly used in value-based and actor-critic methods. We empirically demonstrate its advantages on Atari $2600$ games and in continuous-control MuJoCo environments.

**ABSTRACT**  
We introduce a two-step method for the matrix recovery problem. Our approach combines the theoretical foundations of the Column Subset Selection and Low-rank Matrix Completion problems. The proposed method, in each step, solves a convex optimization task. We present two algorithms that implement our Columns Selected Matrix Completion (CSMC) method, each dedicated to a different size problem. We performed a formal analysis of the presented method, in which we formulated the necessary assumptions and the probability of finding a correct solution. In the second part of the paper, we present the results of the experimental work. Numerical experiments verified the correctness and performance of the algorithms. To study the influence of the matrix size, rank, and the proportion of missing elements on the quality of the solution and the computation time, we performed experiments on synthetic data. The presented method was applied to two real-life problems problems: prediction of movie rates in a <b>recommendation</b> system and image inpainting. Our thorough analysis shows that CSMC provides solutions of comparable quality to matrix completion algorithms, which are based on convex optimization. However, CSMC offers notable savings in terms of runtime.

**ABSTRACT**  
Adversarial example (AE) is an attack method for machine learning, which is crafted by adding imperceptible perturbation to the data inducing misclassification. In the current paper, we investigated the upper bound of the probability of successful AEs based on the <b>Gaussian</b> <b>Process</b> (GP) classification. We proved a new upper bound that depends on AE's perturbation norm, the kernel function used in GP, and the distance of the closest pair with different labels in the training dataset. Surprisingly, the upper bound is determined regardless of the distribution of the sample dataset. We showed that our theoretical result was confirmed through the experiment using ImageNet. In addition, we showed that changing the parameters of the kernel function induces a change of the upper bound of the probability of successful AEs.

**ABSTRACT**  
Permutation invariance is among the most common symmetry that can be exploited to simplify complex problems in machine learning (ML). There has been a tremendous surge of research activities in building permutation invariant ML architectures. However, less attention is given to how to statistically test for permutation invariance of variables in a multivariate probability distribution where the dimension is allowed to grow with the <b>sample</b> <b>size.</b> Also, in terms of a statistical theory, little is known about how permutation invariance helps with estimation in reducing dimensions. In this paper, we take a step back and examine these questions in several fundamental problems: (i) testing the assumption of permutation invariance of multivariate distributions; (ii) estimating permutation invariant densities; (iii) analyzing the metric entropy of smooth permutation invariant function classes and compare them with their counterparts without imposing permutation invariance; (iv) kernel ridge regression of permutation invariant functions in reproducing kernel Hilbert space. In particular, our methods for (i) and (iv) are based on a sorting trick and (ii) is based on an averaging trick. These tricks substantially simplify the exploitation of permutation invariance.

**ABSTRACT**  
The advent of <b>Large</b> <b>Language</b> <b>Models</b> <b>(LLMs)</b> has advanced the <b>benchmark</b> in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. However, <b>large</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> labelled training data are required to train <b>LLMs.</b> Furthermore, data annotation and training are computationally expensive and time-consuming. Zero and <b>few-shot</b> <b>learning</b> have recently emerged as viable options for labelling data using <b>large</b> <b>pre-trained</b> <b>models.</b> <b>Hate</b> <b>speech</b> <b>detection</b> in mix-code <b>low-resource</b> languages is an active problem area where the use of <b>LLMs</b> has proven beneficial. In this study, we have compiled a dataset of 100 YouTube comments, and weakly labelled them for coarse and fine-grained misogyny classification in mix-code Hinglish. Weak annotation was applied due to the labor-intensive annotation process. <b>Zero-shot</b> <b>learning,</b> one-shot learning, and <b>few-shot</b> <b>learning</b> and <b>prompting</b> approaches have then been applied to assign labels to the comments and compare them to human-assigned labels. Out of all the approaches, <b>zero-shot</b> <b>classification</b> using the Bidirectional Auto-Regressive <b>Transformers</b> <b>(BART)</b> <b>large</b> <b>model</b> <b>and</b> <b>few-shot</b> <b>prompting</b> using Generative Pre-trained Transformer- 3 <b>(ChatGPT-3)</b> achieve the best results

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Supervised</b> <b>fine-tuning</b> (SFT), <b>supervised</b> <b>instruction</b> <b>tuning</b> (SIT) and <b>in-context</b> <b>learning</b> <b>(ICL)</b> are three alternative, de facto standard approaches to <b>few-shot</b> <b>learning.</b> <b>ICL</b> has gained popularity recently with the advent of <b>LLMs</b> due to its simplicity and sample efficiency. Prior research has conducted only limited investigation into how these approaches work for multilingual <b>few-shot</b> <b>learning,</b> and the focus so far has been mostly on their performance. In this work, we present an extensive and systematic comparison of the three approaches, testing them on 6 high- and <b>low-resource</b> <b>languages,</b> <b>three</b> different NLU tasks, and a myriad of <b>language</b> <b>and</b> domain setups. Importantly, performance is only one aspect of the comparison, where we also analyse the approaches through the optics of their computational, inference and financial costs. Our observations show that <b>supervised</b> <b>instruction</b> <b>tuning</b> has the best trade-off between performance and resource requirements. As another contribution, we analyse the impact of target <b>language</b> <b>adaptation</b> of pretrained <b>LLMs</b> and find that the standard adaptation approaches can (superficially) improve target <b>language</b> <b>generation</b> capabilities, but <b>language</b> <b>understanding</b> elicited through <b>ICL</b> does not improve and remains limited, with low scores especially for <b>low-resource</b> languages.

**ABSTRACT**  
In recent advancements in Conversational <b>Large</b> <b>Language</b> <b>Models</b> <b>(LLMs),</b> a concerning trend has emerged, showing that many new base <b>LLMs</b> experience a knowledge reduction in their foundational capabilities following <b>Supervised</b> <b>Fine-Tuning</b> (SFT). This process often leads to issues such as forgetting or a decrease in the base model's abilities. Moreover, <b>fine-tuned</b> models struggle to align with user preferences, inadvertently increasing the generation of toxic outputs when specifically <b>prompted.</b> To overcome these challenges, we adopted an innovative approach by completely bypassing SFT and directly implementing Harmless <b>Reinforcement</b> <b>Learning</b> <b>from</b> <b>Human</b> <b>Feedback</b> <b>(RLHF).</b> Our method not only preserves the base model's general capabilities but also significantly enhances its conversational abilities, while notably reducing the generation of toxic outputs. Our approach holds significant implications for fields that demand a nuanced understanding and generation of responses, such as customer service. We applied this methodology to <b>Mistral,</b> the most popular base model, thereby creating <b>Mistral-Plus.</b> Our validation across 11 general tasks demonstrates that <b>Mistral-Plus</b> outperforms similarly sized open-source base models and their corresponding instruct versions. Importantly, the conversational abilities of <b>Mistral-Plus</b> were significantly improved, indicating a substantial advancement over traditional SFT models in both safety and user preference alignment.

**ABSTRACT**  
Text data has become extremely valuable due to the emergence of machine learning algorithms that learn from it. A lot of high-quality text data generated in the real world is private and therefore cannot be shared or used freely due to privacy concerns. Generating synthetic replicas of private text data with a formal privacy guarantee, i.e., <b>differential</b> <b>privacy</b> (DP), offers a promising and scalable solution. However, existing methods necessitate DP <b>finetuning</b> of <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> <b>(LLMs)</b> on private data to generate DP synthetic data. This approach is not viable for proprietary <b>LLMs</b> (e.g., <b>GPT-3.5)</b> and also demands considerable computational resources for open-source <b>LLMs.</b> Lin et al. (2024) recently introduced the Private Evolution (PE) algorithm to generate DP synthetic images with only API access to <b>diffusion</b> <b>models.</b> In this work, we propose an augmented PE algorithm, named Aug-PE, that applies to the complex setting of text. We use API access to an <b>LLM</b> and generate DP synthetic text without any model training. We conduct comprehensive experiments on three <b>benchmark</b> datasets. Our results demonstrate that Aug-PE produces DP synthetic text that yields competitive utility with the SOTA DP <b>finetuning</b> baselines. This underscores the feasibility of relying solely on API access of <b>LLMs</b> to produce high-quality DP synthetic texts, thereby facilitating more accessible routes to privacy-preserving <b>LLM</b> applications. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/AI-secure/aug-pe.

Recent breakthroughs in <b>Large</b> <b>Language</b> <b>Models</b> <b>(LLMs)</b> have revolutionized <b>natural</b> <b>language</b> <b>understanding</b> and generation, igniting a surge of interest in leveraging these technologies for the nuanced field of scientific literature analysis. Existing <b>benchmarks,</b> however, inadequately evaluate the proficiency of <b>LLMs</b> in the scientific domain, especially in scenarios involving complex comprehension and <b>multimodal</b> data. In response, we introduced SciAssess, a <b>benchmark</b> tailored for the in-depth analysis of scientific literature, crafted to provide a thorough assessment of <b>LLMs'</b> efficacy. SciAssess focuses on evaluating <b>LLMs'</b> abilities in memorization, comprehension, and analysis within scientific contexts. It includes representative tasks from diverse scientific fields, such as general chemistry, organic materials, and alloy materials. And rigorous quality control measures ensure its reliability in terms of correctness, anonymization, and copyright compliance. SciAssess evaluates leading <b>LLMs,</b> including <b>GPT-4,</b> <b>GPT-3.5-turbo,</b> and <b>Gemini,</b> identifying their strengths and areas for improvement and supporting the ongoing development of <b>LLM</b> applications in scientific literature analysis. SciAssess and its resources are made available at https://sci-assess.github.io, offering a valuable tool for advancing <b>LLM</b> capabilities in scientific literature analysis.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recent advances in <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> <b>(LLMs)</b> demonstrate that their capabilities are comparable, or even superior, to humans in many tasks in natural language processing. Despite this progress, <b>LLMs</b> are still inadequate at social-cognitive <b>reasoning,</b> which humans are naturally good at. Drawing inspiration from psychological research on the links between certain personality traits and Theory-of-Mind (ToM) <b>reasoning,</b> and from <b>prompt</b> engineering research on the hyper-sensitivity of <b>prompts</b> in affecting <b>LLMs</b> capabilities, this study investigates how inducing personalities in <b>LLMs</b> using <b>prompts</b> affects their ToM <b>reasoning</b> capabilities. Our findings show that certain induced personalities can significantly affect the <b>LLMs'</b> <b>reasoning</b> capabilities in three different ToM tasks. In particular, traits from the Dark Triad have a larger variable effect on <b>LLMs</b> like <b>GPT-3.5,</b> <b>Llama</b> 2, and <b>Mistral</b> across the different ToM tasks. We find that <b>LLMs</b> that exhibit a higher variance across personality <b>prompts</b> in ToM also tends to be more controllable in personality tests: personality traits in <b>LLMs</b> like <b>GPT-3.5,</b> <b>Llama</b> 2 and <b>Mistral</b> can be controllably adjusted through our personality <b>prompts.</b> In today's landscape where role-play is a common strategy when using <b>LLMs,</b> our research highlights the need for caution, as models that adopt specific personas with personalities potentially also alter their <b>reasoning</b> abilities in an unexpected manner.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this study, a human evaluation is carried out on how hyperparameter settings impact the quality of <b>Transformer-based</b> <b>Neural</b> <b>Machine</b> <b>Translation</b> <b>(NMT)</b> for the <b>low-resourced</b> English--Irish pair. SentencePiece models using both Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) and unigram approaches were appraised. Variations in model architectures included modifying the number of layers, evaluating the optimal number of heads for attention and testing various regularisation techniques. The greatest performance improvement was recorded for a <b>Transformer-optimized</b> model with a 16k BPE subword model. Compared with a baseline <b>Recurrent</b> <b>Neural</b> <b>Network</b> <b>(RNN)</b> model, a <b>Transformer-optimized</b> model demonstrated a <b>BLEU</b> score improvement of 7.8 points. When <b>benchmarked</b> against Google Translate, our translation engines demonstrated significant improvements. Furthermore, a quantitative fine-grained manual evaluation was conducted which compared the performance of <b>machine</b> <b>translation</b> systems. Using the Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM) error taxonomy, a human evaluation of the error types generated by an <b>RNN-based</b> system and a <b>Transformer-based</b> system was explored. Our findings show the best-performing <b>Transformer</b> system significantly reduces both accuracy and fluency errors when compared with an <b>RNN-based</b> model.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> <b>(LLMs)</b> have shown great potential in complex <b>reasoning</b> tasks, yet their performance is often hampered by the scarcity of high-quality, <b>reasoning-focused</b> training datasets. Addressing this challenge, we propose Key-Point-Driven Data Synthesis (KPDDS), a novel data synthesis framework that synthesizes question-answer pairs by leveraging key points and exemplar pairs from authentic data sources. KPDDS ensures the generation of novel questions with rigorous quality control and substantial scalability. As a result, we present KPMath, the most extensive synthetic dataset tailored for <b>mathematical</b> <b>reasoning</b> to date, comprising over one million question-answer pairs. Utilizing KPMath and augmenting it with additional <b>reasoning-intensive</b> corpora, we create the comprehensive KPMath-Plus dataset. <b>Fine-tuning</b> the <b>Mistral-7B</b> model on KPMath-Plus yields a <b>zero-shot</b> PASS@1 accuracy of 39.3% on the MATH test set, a performance that not only outpaces other <b>finetuned</b> 7B models but also exceeds that of certain 34B models. Our ablation studies further confirm the substantial enhancement in <b>mathematical</b> <b>reasoning</b> across various subtopics, marking a significant stride in <b>LLMs'</b> <b>reasoning</b> capabilities.

**ABSTRACT**  
Product offers on e-commerce websites often consist of a textual product title and a textual product description. In order to provide features such as faceted product filtering or content-based product <b>recommendation,</b> the websites need to extract attribute-value pairs from the unstructured product descriptions. This paper explores the potential of using <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> <b>(LLMs),</b> such as OpenAI's <b>GPT-3.5</b> and <b>GPT-4,</b> to extract and normalize attribute values from product titles and product descriptions. For our experiments, we introduce the WDC Product Attribute-Value Extraction (WDC PAVE) dataset. WDC PAVE consists of product offers from 87 websites that provide schema$.$org annotations. The offers belong to five different categories, each featuring a specific set of attributes. The dataset provides manually verified attribute-value pairs in two forms: (i) directly extracted values and (ii) normalized attribute values. The normalization of the attribute values requires systems to perform the following types of operations: name expansion, generalization, unit of measurement normalization, and string wrangling. Our experiments demonstrate that <b>GPT-4</b> outperforms <b>PLM-based</b> extraction methods by 10%, achieving an F1-Score of 91%. For the extraction and normalization of product attribute values, <b>GPT-4</b> achieves a similar performance to the extraction scenario, while being particularly strong at string wrangling and name expansion.

**ABSTRACT**  
The advent of Multilingual Language Models (MLLMs) and <b>Large</b> <b>Language</b> <b>Models</b> has spawned innovation in many areas of natural language processing. Despite the exciting potential of this technology, its impact on developing high-quality <b>Machine</b> <b>Translation</b> <b>(MT)</b> outputs for <b>low-resource</b> languages remains relatively under-explored. Furthermore, an open-source application, dedicated to both <b>fine-tuning</b> MLLMs and managing the complete <b>MT</b> workflow for <b>low-resources</b> languages, remains unavailable. We aim to address these imbalances through the development of adaptMLLM, which streamlines all processes involved in the <b>fine-tuning</b> of MLLMs for <b>MT.</b> This open-source application is tailored for developers, translators, and users who are engaged in <b>MT.</b> An intuitive interface allows for easy customisation of hyperparameters, and the application offers a range of metrics for model evaluation and the capability to deploy models as a translation service directly within the application. As a multilingual tool, we used adaptMLLM to <b>fine-tune</b> models for two <b>low-resource</b> language pairs: English to Irish (EN$\leftrightarrow$GA) and English to Marathi (EN$\leftrightarrow$MR). Compared with baselines from the LoResMT2021 Shared Task, the adaptMLLM system demonstrated significant improvements. In the EN$\rightarrow$GA direction, an improvement of 5.2 <b>BLEU</b> points was observed and an increase of 40.5 <b>BLEU</b> points was recorded in the GA$\rightarrow$EN direction. Significant improvements in the translation performance of the EN$\leftrightarrow$MR pair were also observed notably in the MR$\rightarrow$EN direction with an increase of 21.3 <b>BLEU</b> points. Finally, a fine-grained human evaluation of the MLLM output on the EN$\rightarrow$GA pair was conducted using the Multidimensional Quality Metrics and Scalar Quality Metrics error taxonomies. The application and models are freely available.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Dense</b> <b>Retrieval</b> (DR) is now considered as a promising tool to enhance the memorization capacity of <b>Large</b> <b>Language</b> <b>Models</b> <b>(LLM)</b> such as <b>GPT3</b> and <b>GPT-4</b> by incorporating external memories. However, due to the paradigm discrepancy between <b>text</b> <b>generation</b> of <b>LLM</b> and DR, it is still an open challenge to integrate the retrieval and generation tasks in a shared <b>LLM.</b> In this paper, we propose an efficient <b>LLM-Oriented</b> Retrieval Tuner, namely LMORT, which decouples DR capacity from base <b>LLM</b> and non-invasively coordinates the optimally aligned and uniform layers of the <b>LLM</b> towards a unified DR space, achieving an efficient and effective DR without tuning the <b>LLM</b> itself. The extensive experiments on six BEIR datasets show that our approach could achieve competitive <b>zero-shot</b> retrieval performance compared to a range of strong DR models while maintaining the generation ability of <b>LLM.</b>

**ABSTRACT**  
Data analysis is a crucial analytical process to generate in-depth studies and conclusive insights to comprehensively answer a given user query for tabular data. In this work, we aim to propose new resources and <b>benchmarks</b> to inspire future research on this crucial yet challenging and under-explored task. However, collecting data analysis annotations curated by experts can be prohibitively expensive. We propose to automatically generate high-quality answer annotations leveraging the <b>code-generation</b> <b>capabilities</b> of <b>LLMs</b> with a multi-turn <b>prompting</b> technique. We construct the DACO dataset, containing (1) 440 databases (of tabular data) collected from real-world scenarios, (2) ~2k query-answer pairs that can serve as <b>weak</b> <b>supervision</b> for model training, and (3) a concentrated but high-quality test set with human refined annotations that serves as our main evaluation <b>benchmark.</b> We train a 6B <b>supervised</b> <b>fine-tuning</b> (SFT) model on DACO dataset, and find that the SFT model learns reasonable data analysis capabilities. To further align the models with human preference, we use <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning</b> to encourage generating analysis perceived by human as helpful, and design a set of dense rewards to propagate the sparse human preference reward to intermediate <b>code</b> <b>generation</b> steps. Our DACO-RL algorithm is evaluated by human annotators to produce more helpful answers than SFT model in 57.72% cases, validating the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm. Data and <b>code</b> <b>are</b> released at https://github.com/shirley-wu/daco

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Pre-trained</b> <b>Language</b> <b>Models</b> <b>(PLMs)</b> can be accurately <b>fine-tuned</b> for downstream <b>text</b> <b>processing</b> tasks. Recently, researchers have introduced several parameter-efficient <b>fine-tuning</b> methods that optimize input <b>prompts</b> or adjust a small number of model parameters (e.g LoRA). In this study, we explore the impact of altering the input <b>text</b> <b>of</b> the original task in conjunction with parameter-efficient <b>fine-tuning</b> methods. To most effectively rewrite the input <b>text,</b> <b>we</b> train a <b>few-shot</b> paraphrase model with a Maximum-Marginal Likelihood objective. Using six <b>few-shot</b> <b>text</b> <b>classification</b> datasets, we show that enriching data with paraphrases at train and test time enhances the performance beyond what can be achieved with parameter-efficient <b>fine-tuning</b> alone.

**ABSTRACT**  
Tables play a crucial role in conveying information in various domains, serving as indispensable tools for organizing and presenting data in a structured manner. We propose a Plan-then-Reason framework to answer different types of user queries over tables with sentence context. The framework first plans the <b>reasoning</b> paths over the context, then assigns each step to program-based or textual <b>reasoning</b> to reach the final answer. We construct an <b>instruction</b> <b>tuning</b> set TrixInstruct following the framework. Our dataset cover queries that are program-unsolvable or need combining information from tables and sentences to obtain planning and <b>reasoning</b> abilities. We present ProTrix by <b>finetuning</b> <b>Llama-2-7B</b> on TrixInstruct. Our experiments show that ProTrix generalizes to diverse tabular tasks and achieves comparable performance to <b>GPT-3.5-turbo.</b> We further demonstrate that ProTrix can generate accurate and faithful explanations to answer complex free-form questions. Our work underscores the importance of the planning and <b>reasoning</b> abilities towards a model over tabular tasks with generalizability and interpretability. We will release our dataset and model at https://github.com/WilliamZR/ProTrix.

**ABSTRACT**  
Medical <b>open-domain</b> <b>question</b> <b>answering</b> demands substantial access to specialized knowledge. Recent efforts have sought to decouple knowledge from model parameters, counteracting architectural scaling and allowing for training on common <b>low-resource</b> hardware. The retrieve-then-read paradigm has become ubiquitous, with model predictions grounded on relevant knowledge pieces from external repositories such as PubMed, textbooks, and UMLS. An alternative path, still under-explored but made possible by the advent of domain-specific <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models,</b> entails constructing artificial contexts through <b>prompting.</b> As a result, "to generate or to retrieve" is the modern equivalent of Hamlet's dilemma. This paper presents MedGENIE, the first generate-then-read framework for multiple-choice <b>question</b> <b>answering</b> in medicine. We conduct extensive experiments on MedQA-USMLE, MedMCQA, and <b>MMLU,</b> incorporating a practical perspective by assuming a maximum of 24GB VRAM. MedGENIE sets a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) in the open-book setting of each testbed, even allowing a small-scale reader to outcompete <b>zero-shot</b> closed-book 175B baselines while using up to 706$\times$ fewer parameters. Overall, our findings reveal that generated passages are more effective than retrieved counterparts in attaining higher accuracy.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recent advancements in <b>text</b> <b>summarization,</b> particularly with the advent of <b>Large</b> <b>Language</b> <b>Models</b> <b>(LLMs),</b> have shown remarkable performance. However, a notable challenge persists as a substantial number of automatically-generated summaries exhibit factual inconsistencies, such as hallucinations. In response to this issue, various approaches for the evaluation of consistency for <b>summarization</b> have emerged. Yet, these newly-introduced metrics face several limitations, including lack of interpretability, focus on short document summaries (e.g., news articles), and computational impracticality, especially for <b>LLM-based</b> metrics. To address these shortcomings, we propose Factuality Evaluation of <b>summarization</b> based on <b>Natural</b> <b>language</b> <b>Inference</b> and Claim Extraction (FENICE), a more interpretable and efficient factuality-oriented metric. FENICE leverages an <b>NLI-based</b> alignment between information in the source document and a set of atomic facts, referred to as claims, extracted from the summary. Our metric sets a new state of the art on AGGREFACT, the de-facto <b>benchmark</b> for factuality evaluation. Moreover, we extend our evaluation to a more challenging setting by conducting a human annotation process of long-form <b>summarization.</b>

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Knowledge</b> <b>graph</b> completion (KGC) is a widely used method to tackle incompleteness in <b>knowledge</b> <b>graphs</b> <b>(KGs)</b> by making predictions for missing links. Description-based KGC leverages <b>pre-trained</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> to learn entity and relation representations with their names or descriptions, which shows promising results. However, the performance of description-based KGC is still limited by the quality of text and the incomplete structure, as it lacks sufficient entity descriptions and relies solely on relation names, leading to sub-optimal results. To address this issue, we propose MPIKGC, a general framework to compensate for the deficiency of contextualized <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> improve KGC by querying <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> <b>(LLMs)</b> from various perspectives, which involves leveraging the <b>reasoning,</b> explanation, and <b>summarization</b> capabilities of <b>LLMs</b> to expand entity descriptions, understand relations, and extract structures, respectively. We conducted extensive evaluation of the effectiveness and improvement of our framework based on four description-based KGC models and four datasets, for both link prediction and triplet classification tasks.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Pre-trained</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> have been proven to possess strong base capabilities, which not only excel in in-distribution language modeling but also show powerful abilities in <b>out-of-distribution</b> language modeling, <b>transfer</b> <b>learning</b> and <b>few-shot</b> <b>learning.</b> Unlike existing work focusing on the influence of scale on base capabilities, our work examines the influence of architecture on those. Specifically, our concern is: How does architecture influence the base capabilities of <b>pre-trained</b> <b>language</b> <b>models?</b> In this work, we attempt to explain and reverse the decline in base capabilities caused by the architecture of FFN-Wider <b>Transformers,</b> seeking to provide some insights. Through analysis, we found the contribution ratio of Multi-Head Attention (a combination function) to <b>pre-trained</b> <b>language</b> <b>modeling</b> is a key factor affecting base capabilities. FFN-Wider <b>Transformers</b> reduce the contribution ratio of this combination function, leading to a decline in base capabilities. We confirmed this by experiments and proposed Combination Enhancement Architecture (CEA) to address the decline in base capabilities of such models. Significantly, we extended our explanation and CEA to Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture <b>Transformers,</b> which also alleviated their decline in base capabilities to some extent, proving our work can offer useful guidance for architecture analysis, architecture improvement and architecture design.

**ABSTRACT**  
In <b>reasoning</b> tasks, even a minor error can cascade into inaccurate results, leading to suboptimal performance of <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> in such domains. Earlier <b>fine-tuning</b> approaches sought to mitigate this by leveraging more precise supervisory signals from human labeling, larger models, or self-sampling, although at a high cost. Conversely, we develop a method that avoids external resources, relying instead on introducing perturbations to the input. Our training approach randomly masks certain tokens within the chain of thought, a technique we found to be particularly effective for <b>reasoning</b> tasks. When applied to <b>fine-tuning</b> with GSM8K, this method achieved a 5% improvement in accuracy over standard <b>supervised</b> <b>fine-tuning</b> with a few codes modified and no additional labeling effort. Furthermore, it is complementary to existing methods. When integrated with related <b>data</b> <b>augmentation</b> methods, it leads to an average improvement of 3% improvement in GSM8K accuracy and 1% improvement in MATH accuracy across five datasets of various quality and size, as well as two base models. We further investigate the mechanisms behind this improvement through case studies and quantitative analysis, suggesting that our approach may provide superior support for the model in capturing long-distance dependencies, especially those related to questions. This enhancement could deepen understanding of premises in questions and prior steps. Our code is available at Github.

**ABSTRACT**  
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) serves as a critical emerging ability in <b>LLMs,</b> especially when it comes to logical <b>reasoning.</b> Attempts have been made to induce such ability in small models as well by <b>distilling</b> from the <b>data</b> <b>with</b> CoT generated by <b>Large</b> <b>Language</b> <b>Models</b> <b>(LLMs).</b> However, existing methods often simply generate and incorporate more <b>data</b> <b>from</b> <b>LLMs</b> and fail to note the importance of efficiently utilizing existing CoT <b>data.</b> <b>We</b> here propose a new training paradigm AS-ES (Abstractive Segments - Extractive Segments) learning, which exploits the inherent information in CoT for iterative generation. Experiments show that our methods surpass the direct seq2seq training on CoT-extensive tasks like MWP and PET <b>summarization,</b> without <b>data</b> <b>augmentation</b> or altering the model itself. Furthermore, we explore the reason behind the inefficiency of small models in learning CoT and provide an explanation of why AS-ES learning works, giving insights into the underlying mechanism of CoT.

**ABSTRACT**  
The massive generation of <b>multimodal</b> <b>fake</b> <b>news</b> <b>exhibits</b> substantial distribution discrepancies, <b>prompting</b> the need for generalized detectors. However, the insulated nature of training within specific domains restricts the capability of classical detectors to obtain open-world facts. In this paper, we propose FakeNewsGPT4, a novel framework that augments Large <b>Vision-Language</b> Models (LVLMs) with forgery-specific knowledge for manipulation <b>reasoning</b> while inheriting extensive world knowledge as complementary. Knowledge augmentation in FakeNewsGPT4 involves acquiring two types of forgery-specific knowledge, i.e., semantic correlation and artifact trace, and merging them into LVLMs. Specifically, we design a multi-level cross-modal <b>reasoning</b> module that establishes interactions across modalities for extracting semantic correlations. Concurrently, a dual-branch fine-grained verification module is presented to comprehend localized details to encode artifact traces. The generated knowledge is translated into refined embeddings compatible with LVLMs. We also incorporate candidate answer heuristics and soft <b>prompts</b> to enhance input informativeness. Extensive experiments on the public <b>benchmark</b> demonstrate that FakeNewsGPT4 achieves superior cross-domain performance compared to previous methods. Code will be available.

**ABSTRACT**  
Understanding the <b>reasoning</b> capabilities of <b>Multimodal</b> <b>Large</b> <b>Language</b> <b>Models</b> (MLLMs) is an important area of research. In this study, we introduce a dynamic <b>benchmark,</b> NPHardEval4V, aimed at addressing the existing gaps in evaluating the pure <b>reasoning</b> abilities of MLLMs. Our <b>benchmark</b> aims to provide a venue to disentangle the effect of various factors such as image recognition and <b>instruction</b> <b>following,</b> from the overall performance of the models, allowing us to focus solely on evaluating their <b>reasoning</b> abilities. It is built by converting textual description of questions from NPHardEval to image representations. Our findings reveal significant discrepancies in <b>reasoning</b> abilities across different models and highlight the relatively weak performance of MLLMs compared to <b>LLMs</b> in terms of <b>reasoning.</b> We also investigate the impact of different <b>prompting</b> styles, including visual, text, and combined visual and text <b>prompts,</b> on the <b>reasoning</b> abilities of MLLMs, demonstrating the different impacts of <b>multimodal</b> inputs in model performance. Unlike traditional <b>benchmarks,</b> which focus primarily on static evaluations, our <b>benchmark</b> will be updated monthly to prevent overfitting and ensure a more authentic and fine-grained evaluation of the models. We believe that this <b>benchmark</b> can aid in understanding and guide the further development of <b>reasoning</b> abilities in MLLMs. The <b>benchmark</b> dataset and code are available at https://github.com/lizhouf/NPHardEval4V

We present TMMLU+, a comprehensive dataset designed for the Traditional Chinese <b>massive</b> <b>multitask</b> <b>language</b> <b>understanding</b> dataset. TMMLU+ is a multiple-choice <b>question-answering</b> <b>dataset</b> with 66 subjects from elementary to professional level. Compared to its predecessor, TMMLU, TMMLU+ is six times larger and boasts a more balanced subject distribution. We included <b>benchmark</b> results in TMMLU+ from closed-source models and 24 open-weight Chinese <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> of parameters ranging from 1.8B to 72B. Our findings reveal that Traditional Chinese models still trail behind their Simplified Chinese counterparts. Additionally, current <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> have yet to outperform human performance in average scores. We publicly release our dataset and the corresponding <b>benchmark</b> source code.

**ABSTRACT**  
LLMOps incur significant costs due to hardware requirements, hindering their widespread accessibility. Additionally, a lack of transparency in model training methods and data contributes to the majority of models being non-reproducible. To tackle these challenges, the <b>LLM</b> Efficiency Challenge was introduced at NeurIPS Workshop, aiming to adapt <b>foundation</b> <b>models</b> on a diverse set of tasks via <b>fine-tuning</b> on a single GPU (RTX 4090 or A100 with 40GB) within a 24-hour timeframe. In this system description paper, we introduce Birbal, our <b>Mistral-7B</b> based winning model, <b>fine-tuned</b> on a single RTX 4090 for 16 hours. Birbal's success lies in curating high-quality instructions covering diverse tasks, resulting in a 35% performance improvement over second-best Qwen-14B based submission.

**ABSTRACT**  
The <b>Transformer</b> model is the state-of-the-art in <b>Machine</b> <b>Translation.</b> However, in general, neural translation models often under perform on language pairs with insufficient training data. As a consequence, relatively few experiments have been carried out using this architecture on <b>low-resource</b> language pairs. In this study, hyperparameter optimization of <b>Transformer</b> models in translating the <b>low-resource</b> English-Irish language pair is evaluated. We demonstrate that choosing appropriate parameters leads to considerable performance improvements. Most importantly, the correct choice of subword model is shown to be the biggest driver of translation performance. SentencePiece models using both unigram and BPE approaches were appraised. Variations on model architectures included modifying the number of layers, testing various regularisation techniques and evaluating the optimal number of heads for attention. A generic 55k DGT corpus and an in-domain 88k public admin corpus were used for evaluation. A <b>Transformer</b> optimized model demonstrated a <b>BLEU</b> score improvement of 7.8 points when compared with a baseline <b>RNN</b> model. Improvements were observed across a range of metrics, including TER, indicating a substantially reduced post editing effort for <b>Transformer</b> optimized models with 16k BPE subword models. Bench-marked against Google Translate, our translation engines demonstrated significant improvements. The question of whether or not <b>Transformers</b> can be used effectively in a <b>low-resource</b> setting of English-Irish translation has been addressed. Is f\'eidir linn - yes we can.

**ABSTRACT**  
Current approaches to <b>question</b> <b>answering</b> rely on <b>pre-trained</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> <b>(PLMs)</b> like <b>RoBERTa.</b> This work challenges the existing <b>question-answer</b> <b>encoding</b> convention and explores finer representations. We begin with testing various pooling methods compared to using the begin-of-sentence token as a <b>question</b> <b>representation</b> for better quality. Next, we explore opportunities to simultaneously embed all answer candidates with the <b>question.</b> <b>This</b> enables cross-reference between answer choices and improves inference throughput via reduced memory usage. Despite their simplicity and effectiveness, these methods have yet to be widely studied in current frameworks. We experiment with different <b>PLMs,</b> and with and without the integration of <b>knowledge</b> <b>graphs.</b> Results prove that the memory efficacy of the proposed techniques with little sacrifice in performance. Practically, our work enhances 38-100% throughput with 26-65% speedups on consumer-grade GPUs by allowing for considerably larger batch sizes. Our work sends a message to the community with promising directions in both representation quality and efficiency for the <b>question-answering</b> <b>task</b> in natural language processing.

**ABSTRACT**  
adaptNMT streamlines all processes involved in the development and deployment of <b>RNN</b> and <b>Transformer</b> <b>neural</b> <b>translation</b> <b>models.</b> As an open-source application, it is designed for both technical and non-technical users who work in the field of <b>machine</b> <b>translation.</b> Built upon the widely-adopted OpenNMT ecosystem, the application is particularly useful for new entrants to the field since the setup of the development environment and creation of train, validation and test splits is greatly simplified. <b>Graphing,</b> embedded within the application, illustrates the progress of model training, and SentencePiece is used for creating subword segmentation models. Hyperparameter customization is facilitated through an intuitive user interface, and a single-click model development approach has been implemented. Models developed by adaptNMT can be evaluated using a range of metrics, and deployed as a translation service within the application. To support eco-friendly research in the NLP space, a green report also flags the power consumption and kgCO$_{2}$ emissions generated during model development. The application is freely available.

**ABSTRACT**  
The widespread presence of offensive languages on social media has resulted in adverse effects on societal well-being. As a result, it has become very important to address this issue with high priority. Offensive languages exist in both explicit and implicit forms, with the latter being more challenging to detect. Current research in this domain encounters several challenges. Firstly, the existing datasets primarily rely on the collection of texts containing explicit offensive keywords, making it challenging to capture implicitly offensive contents that are devoid of these keywords. Secondly, usual methodologies tend to focus solely on textual analysis, neglecting the valuable insights that community information can provide. In this research paper, we introduce a novel dataset OffLanDat, a community based implicit offensive language dataset generated by <b>ChatGPT</b> containing data for 38 different target groups. Despite limitations in generating offensive texts using <b>ChatGPT</b> due to ethical constraints, we present a <b>prompt-based</b> approach that effectively generates implicit offensive languages. To ensure data quality, we evaluate our data with human. Additionally, we employ a <b>prompt-based</b> <b>Zero-Shot</b> method with <b>ChatGPT</b> and compare the detection results between human annotation and <b>ChatGPT</b> annotation. We utilize existing state-of-the-art models to see how effective they are in detecting such languages. We will make our code and dataset public for other researchers.

**ABSTRACT**  
The inference phase of <b>Large</b> <b>Language</b> <b>Models</b> <b>(LLMs)</b> is very expensive. An ideal inference stage of <b>LLMs</b> could utilize fewer computational resources while still maintaining its capabilities (e.g., generalization and <b>in-context</b> <b>learning</b> ability). In this paper, we try to answer the question, "During <b>LLM</b> inference, can we use shallow layers for easy instances; and deep layers for hard ones?" To answer this question, we first indicate that Not all Layers are Necessary during Inference by statistically analyzing the activated layers across tasks. Then, we propose a simple algorithm named AdaInfer to determine the inference termination moment based on the input instance adaptively. More importantly, AdaInfer does not alter <b>LLM</b> parameters and maintains generalizability across tasks. Experiments on well-known <b>LLMs</b> (i.e., Llama2 series and OPT) show that AdaInfer saves an average of 14.8% of computational resources, even up to 50% on sentiment tasks, while maintaining comparable performance. Additionally, this method is orthogonal to other model acceleration techniques, potentially boosting inference efficiency further.

**ABSTRACT**  
This communication presents preliminary findings from comparing two recent <b>chatbots,</b> OpenAI's <b>ChatGPT</b> and Google's <b>Bard,</b> in the context of fire engineering by evaluating their responses in handling fire safety related queries. A diverse range of fire engineering questions and scenarios were created and examined, including structural fire design, fire prevention strategies, evacuation, building code compliance, and fire suppression systems (some of which resemble those commonly present in the Fire Protection exam (FPE)). The results reveal some key differences in the performance of the <b>chatbots,</b> with <b>ChatGPT</b> demonstrating a relatively superior performance. Then, this communication highlights the potential for <b>chatbot</b> technology to revolutionize fire engineering practices by providing instant access to critical information while outlining areas for further improvement and research. Evidently, and when it matures, this technology will likely be elemental to our engineers' practice and education.

**ABSTRACT**  
A common way of assessing language learners' mastery of vocabulary is via multiple-choice cloze (i.e., fill-in-the-blank) questions. But the creation of test items can be laborious for individual teachers or in <b>large-scale</b> <b>language</b> <b>programs.</b> In this paper, we evaluate a new method for automatically generating these types of questions using <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> <b>(LLM).</b> The VocaTT (vocabulary teaching and training) engine is written in Python and comprises three basic steps: pre-processing target word lists, generating sentences and candidate word options using <b>GPT,</b> and finally selecting suitable word options. To test the efficiency of this system, 60 questions were generated targeting academic words. The generated items were reviewed by expert reviewers who judged the well-formedness of the sentences and word options, adding comments to items judged not well-formed. Results showed a 75% rate of well-formedness for sentences and 66.85% rate for suitable word options. This is a marked improvement over the generator used earlier in our research which did not take advantage of <b>GPT's</b> capabilities. Post-hoc qualitative analysis reveals several points for improvement in future work including cross-referencing part-of-speech tagging, better sentence validation, and improving <b>GPT</b> <b>prompts.</b>

**ABSTRACT**  
Lexicon-based constrained decoding approaches aim to control the meaning or style of the generated text through certain target concepts. Existing approaches over-focus the targets themselves, leading to a lack of high-level <b>reasoning</b> about how to achieve them. However, human usually tackles tasks by following certain rules that not only focuses on the targets but also on semantically relevant concepts that induce the occurrence of targets. In this work, we present DECIDER, a rule-controllable decoding strategy for constrained <b>language</b> <b>generation</b> inspired by dual-system cognitive theory. Specifically, in DECIDER, a <b>pre-trained</b> <b>language</b> <b>model</b> <b>(PLM)</b> is equiped with a logic reasoner that takes high-level rules as input. Then, the DECIDER allows rule signals to flow into the <b>PLM</b> at each decoding step. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DECIDER can effectively follow given rules to guide generation direction toward the targets in a more human-like manner.

**ABSTRACT**  
To undertake computational research of the law, efficiently identifying datasets of court decisions that relate to a specific legal issue is a crucial yet challenging endeavour. This study addresses the gap in the literature working with <b>large</b> <b>legal</b> <b>corpora</b> about how to isolate cases, in our case summary judgments, from a <b>large</b> <b>corpus</b> <b>of</b> UK court decisions. We introduce a comparative analysis of two computational methods: (1) a traditional natural language processing-based approach leveraging expert-generated keywords and logical operators and (2) an innovative application of the <b>Claude</b> 2 <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>model</b> to classify cases based on content-specific <b>prompts.</b> We use the Cambridge Law Corpus of 356,011 UK court decisions and determine that the <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>model</b> achieves a weighted F1 score of 0.94 versus 0.78 for keywords. Despite iterative refinement, the search logic based on keywords fails to capture nuances in legal language. We identify and extract 3,102 summary judgment cases, enabling us to map their distribution across various UK courts over a temporal span. The paper marks a pioneering step in employing advanced natural language processing to tackle core legal research tasks, demonstrating how these technologies can bridge systemic gaps and enhance the accessibility of legal information. We share the extracted dataset metrics to support further research on summary judgments.

**ABSTRACT**  
Mixtral, a representative sparse mixture of experts (SMoE) language model, has received significant attention due to its unique model design and superior performance. Based on Mixtral-8x7B-v0.1, in this paper, we propose Chinese-Mixtral and Chinese-Mixtral-Instruct with improved Chinese language abilities by adopting further pre-training and instruction <b>fine-tuning.</b> Experimental results show that our Chinese-Mixtral and Chinese-Mixtral-Instruct successfully improve Chinese understanding and generation performance while retaining the original English abilities. Then, we discuss several key questions when performing language adaptation on <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models,</b> including the necessity of extending the language-specific vocabulary and the choice of the initialization model <b>(foundation</b> <b>model</b> v.s. instruction model), by providing empirical results and analysis. We also present the visualizations of each expert to examine their importance on downstream tasks. Our resources are publicly available through \url{https://github.com/ymcui/Chinese-Mixtral}.

**ABSTRACT**  
Grading short answer questions automatically with interpretable <b>reasoning</b> behind the grading decision is a challenging goal for current <b>transformer</b> approaches. Justification cue detection, in combination with logical reasoners, has shown a promising direction for neuro-symbolic architectures in ASAG. But, one of the main challenges is the requirement of annotated justification cues in the students' responses, which only exist for a few ASAG datasets. To overcome this challenge, we contribute (1) a weakly <b>supervised</b> annotation procedure for justification cues in ASAG datasets, and (2) a neuro-symbolic model for explainable ASAG based on justification cues. Our approach improves upon the RMSE by 0.24 to 0.3 compared to the state-of-the-art on the Short Answer Feedback dataset in a bilingual, multi-domain, and multi-question training setup. This result shows that our approach provides a promising direction for generating high-quality grades and accompanying explanations for future research in ASAG and educational NLP.

**ABSTRACT**  
Multi-Label <b>Text</b> <b>Classification</b> (MLTC) is a fundamental task in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that involves the assignment of multiple labels to a given <b>text.</b> <b>MLTC</b> has gained significant importance and has been widely applied in various domains such as topic recognition, <b>recommendation</b> systems, <b>sentiment</b> <b>analysis,</b> and <b>information</b> <b>retrieval.</b> However, traditional machine learning and Deep neural network have not yet addressed certain issues, such as the fact that some documents are brief but have a large number of labels and how to establish relationships between the labels. It is imperative to additionally acknowledge that the significance of knowledge is substantiated in the realm of MLTC. To address this issue, we provide a novel approach known as Knowledge-enhanced Doc-Label Attention Network (KeNet). Specifically, we design an Attention Network that incorporates external knowledge, label embedding, and a comprehensive attention mechanism. In contrast to conventional methods, we use comprehensive representation of documents, knowledge and labels to predict all labels for each single <b>text.</b> <b>Our</b> approach has been validated by comprehensive research conducted on three multi-label datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art MLTC method. Additionally, a case study is undertaken to illustrate the practical implementation of KeNet.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Multimodal</b> Conversational Emotion (MCE) detection, generally spanning across the acoustic, vision and language modalities, has attracted increasing interest in the multimedia community. Previous studies predominantly focus on learning contextual information in conversations with only a few considering the <b>topic</b> <b>information</b> in single language modality, while always neglecting the acoustic and vision <b>topic</b> <b>information.</b> On this basis, we propose a model-agnostic <b>Topic-enriched</b> <b>Diffusion</b> <b>(TopicDiff)</b> approach for capturing <b>multimodal</b> <b>topic</b> <b>information</b> in MCE tasks. Particularly, we integrate the <b>diffusion</b> <b>model</b> into neural <b>topic</b> <b>model</b> to alleviate the diversity deficiency problem of neural <b>topic</b> <b>model</b> in capturing <b>topic</b> <b>information.</b> Detailed evaluations demonstrate the significant improvements of TopicDiff over the state-of-the-art MCE baselines, justifying the importance of <b>multimodal</b> <b>topic</b> <b>information</b> to MCE and the effectiveness of TopicDiff in capturing such information. Furthermore, we observe an interesting finding that the <b>topic</b> <b>information</b> in acoustic and vision is more discriminative and robust compared to the language.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> hold significant promise in multilingual applications. However, inherent biases <b>stemming</b> from predominantly English-centric pre-training have led to the widespread practice of pre-translation, i.e., translating non-English inputs to English before inference, leading to complexity and information loss. This study re-evaluates the need for pre-translation in the context of PaLM2 models (Anil et al., 2023), which have been established as highly performant in multilingual tasks. We offer a comprehensive investigation across 108 languages and 6 diverse <b>benchmarks,</b> including open-end generative tasks, which were excluded from previous similar studies. Our findings challenge the pre-translation paradigm established in prior research, highlighting the advantages of direct inference in PaLM2. Specifically, PaLM2-L consistently outperforms pre-translation in 94 out of 108 languages. These findings pave the way for more efficient and effective multilingual applications, alleviating the limitations associated with pre-translation and unlocking linguistic authenticity.

**ABSTRACT**  
Human label variation arises when annotators assign different labels to the same item for valid reasons, while annotation errors occur when labels are assigned for invalid reasons. These two issues are prevalent in NLP <b>benchmarks,</b> yet existing research has studied them in isolation. To the best of our knowledge, there exists no prior work that focuses on teasing apart error from signal, especially in cases where signal is beyond black-and-white. To fill this gap, we introduce a systematic methodology and a new dataset, VariErr (variation versus error), focusing on the <b>NLI</b> task in English. We propose a 2-round annotation scheme with annotators explaining each label and subsequently judging the validity of label-explanation pairs. \name{} contains 7,574 validity judgments on 1,933 explanations for 500 re-annotated <b>NLI</b> items. We assess the effectiveness of various automatic error detection (AED) methods and <b>GPTs</b> in uncovering errors versus human label variation. We find that state-of-the-art AED methods significantly underperform compared to <b>GPTs</b> and humans. While <b>GPT-4</b> is the best system, it still falls short of human performance. Our methodology is applicable beyond <b>NLI,</b> offering fertile ground for future research on error versus plausible variation, which in turn can yield better and more trustworthy NLP systems.

**ABSTRACT**  
To foster the neural encoding of Portuguese, this paper contributes foundation encoder models that represent an expansion of the still very scarce ecosystem of <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> specifically developed for this language that are fully open, in the sense that they are open source and openly distributed for free under an open license for any purpose, thus including research and commercial usages. Like most languages other than English, Portuguese is <b>low-resourced</b> in terms of these foundational language resources, there being the inaugural 900 million parameter Albertina and 335 million Bertimbau. Taking this couple of models as an inaugural set, we present the extension of the ecosystem of state-of-the-art open encoders for Portuguese with a larger, top performance-driven model with 1.5 billion parameters, and a smaller, efficiency-driven model with 100 million parameters. While achieving this primary goal, further results that are relevant for this ecosystem were obtained as well, namely new datasets for Portuguese based on the <b>SuperGLUE</b> <b>benchmark,</b> which we also distribute openly.

**ABSTRACT**  
Indonesia's linguistic landscape is remarkably diverse, encompassing over 700 languages and dialects, making it one of the world's most linguistically rich nations. This diversity, coupled with the widespread practice of code-switching and the presence of <b>low-resource</b> regional languages, presents unique challenges for modern <b>pre-trained</b> <b>language</b> <b>models.</b> In response to these challenges, we developed NusaBERT, building upon IndoBERT by incorporating vocabulary expansion and leveraging a diverse multilingual corpus that includes regional languages and dialects. Through rigorous evaluation across a range of <b>benchmarks,</b> NusaBERT demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in tasks involving multiple languages of Indonesia, paving the way for future <b>natural</b> <b>language</b> <b>understanding</b> research for under-represented languages.

**ABSTRACT**  
In recent years, <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> <b>(LLMs)</b> have become increasingly prevalent, offering remarkable <b>text</b> <b>generation</b> capabilities. However, a pressing challenge is their tendency to make confidently wrong predictions, highlighting the critical need for uncertainty quantification (UQ) in <b>LLMs.</b> While previous works have mainly focused on addressing aleatoric uncertainty, the full spectrum of uncertainties, including epistemic, remains inadequately explored. Motivated by this gap, we introduce a novel UQ method, sampling with perturbation for UQ (SPUQ), designed to tackle both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. The method entails generating a set of perturbations for <b>LLM</b> inputs, sampling outputs for each perturbation, and incorporating an aggregation module that generalizes the sampling uncertainty approach for <b>text</b> <b>generation</b> tasks. Through extensive experiments on various datasets, we investigated different perturbation and aggregation techniques. Our findings show a substantial improvement in model uncertainty calibration, with a reduction in Expected Calibration Error (ECE) by 50\% on average. Our findings suggest that our proposed UQ method offers promising steps toward enhancing the reliability and trustworthiness of <b>LLMs.</b>

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Large</b> <b>Language</b> <b>Models</b> <b>(LLMs)</b> have become integral components in various autonomous agent systems. In this study, we present an exploration-based trajectory optimization approach, referred to as ETO. This learning method is designed to enhance the performance of open <b>LLM</b> agents. Contrary to previous studies that exclusively train on successful expert trajectories, our method allows agents to learn from their exploration failures. This leads to improved performance through an iterative optimization framework. During the exploration phase, the agent interacts with the environment while completing given tasks, gathering failure trajectories to create <b>contrastive</b> <b>trajectory</b> pairs. In the subsequent training phase, the agent utilizes these trajectory preference pairs to update its policy using <b>contrastive</b> <b>learning</b> methods like DPO. This iterative cycle of exploration and training fosters continued improvement in the agents. Our experiments on three complex tasks demonstrate that ETO consistently surpasses baseline performance by a <b>large</b> <b>margin.</b> <b>Furthermore,</b> an examination of task-solving efficiency and potential in scenarios lacking expert trajectory underscores the effectiveness of our approach.

**ABSTRACT**  
The paper reports on a series of experiments aiming at probing LeBenchmark, a pretrained acoustic model trained on 7k hours of spoken French, for syntactic information. Pretrained acoustic models are increasingly used for downstream <b>speech</b> <b>tasks</b> such as <b>automatic</b> <b>speech</b> <b>recognition,</b> <b>speech</b> <b>translation,</b> spoken language understanding or <b>speech</b> <b>parsing.</b> They are trained on very low level information (the raw <b>speech</b> <b>signal),</b> and do not have explicit lexical knowledge. Despite that, they obtained reasonable results on tasks that requires higher level linguistic knowledge. As a result, an emerging question is whether these models encode syntactic information. We probe each representation layer of LeBenchmark for syntax, using the Orf\'eo treebank, and observe that it has learnt some syntactic information. Our results show that syntactic information is more easily extractable from the middle layers of the network, after which a very sharp decrease is observed.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Transformer-based</b> Neural Language Models achieve state-of-the-art performance on various natural language processing tasks. However, an open question is the extent to which these models rely on word-order/syntactic or word co-occurrence/topic-based information when processing natural language. This work contributes to this debate by addressing the question of whether these models primarily use topic as a signal, by exploring the relationship between <b>Transformer-based</b> models' <b>(BERT</b> and <b>RoBERTa's)</b> performance on a range of probing tasks in English, from simple lexical tasks such as sentence length prediction to complex semantic tasks such as idiom token identification, and the sensitivity of these tasks to the topic information. To this end, we propose a novel probing method which we call topic-aware probing. Our initial results indicate that <b>Transformer-based</b> models encode both topic and non-topic information in their intermediate layers, but also that the facility of these models to distinguish idiomatic usage is primarily based on their ability to identify and encode topic. Furthermore, our analysis of these models' performance on other standard probing tasks suggests that tasks that are relatively insensitive to the topic information are also tasks that are relatively difficult for these models.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recently, Mixture of Experts (MoE) <b>Transformers</b> have garnered increasing attention due to their advantages in model capacity and computational efficiency. However, studies have indicated that MoE <b>Transformers</b> underperform vanilla <b>Transformers</b> in many downstream tasks, significantly diminishing the practical value of MoE models. To explain this issue, we propose that the pre-training performance and transfer capability of a model are joint determinants of its downstream task performance. MoE models, in comparison to vanilla models, have poorer transfer capability, leading to their subpar performance in downstream tasks. To address this issue, we introduce the concept of transfer capability <b>distillation,</b> positing that although vanilla models have weaker performance, they are effective teachers of transfer capability. The MoE models guided by vanilla models can achieve both strong pre-training performance and transfer capability, ultimately enhancing their performance in downstream tasks. We design a specific <b>distillation</b> method and conduct experiments on the <b>BERT</b> architecture. Experimental results show a significant improvement in downstream performance of MoE models, and many further evidences also strongly support the concept of transfer capability <b>distillation.</b> Finally, we attempt to interpret transfer capability <b>distillation</b> and provide some insights from the perspective of model feature.

**ABSTRACT**  
Kurdish, an Indo-European language spoken by over 30 million speakers, is considered a dialect continuum and known for its diversity in language varieties. Previous studies addressing language and <b>speech</b> <b>technology</b> for Kurdish handle it in a monolithic way as a macro-language, resulting in disparities for dialects and varieties for which there are few resources and tools available. In this paper, we take a step towards developing resources for language and <b>speech</b> <b>technology</b> for varieties of Central Kurdish, creating a corpus by transcribing movies and TV series as an alternative to fieldwork. Additionally, we report the performance of <b>machine</b> <b>translation,</b> <b>automatic</b> <b>speech</b> <b>recognition,</b> and language identification as downstream tasks evaluated on Central Kurdish varieties. Data and models are publicly available under an open license at https://github.com/sinaahmadi/CORDI.

**ABSTRACT**  
Enhancing the attribution in <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> <b>(LLMs)</b> is a crucial task. One feasible approach is to enable <b>LLMs</b> to cite external sources that support their generations. However, existing datasets and evaluation methods in this domain still exhibit notable limitations. In this work, we formulate the task of attributed query-focused <b>summarization</b> (AQFS) and present WebCiteS, a Chinese dataset featuring 7k human-annotated summaries with citations. WebCiteS derives from real-world user queries and web search results, offering a valuable resource for model training and evaluation. Prior works in attribution evaluation do not differentiate between groundedness errors and citation errors. They also fall short in automatically verifying sentences that draw partial support from multiple sources. We tackle these issues by developing detailed metrics and enabling the automatic evaluator to decompose the sentences into sub-claims for fine-grained verification. Our comprehensive evaluation of both open-source and proprietary models on WebCiteS highlights the challenge <b>LLMs</b> face in correctly citing sources, underscoring the necessity for further improvement. The dataset and code will be open-sourced to facilitate further research in this crucial field.

**ABSTRACT**  
Parameter-efficient tuning methods such as LoRA could achieve comparable performance to model tuning by tuning a small portion of the parameters. However, substantial computational resources are still required, as this process involves calculating gradients and performing back-propagation throughout the model. Much effort has recently been devoted to utilizing the derivative-free optimization method to eschew the computation of gradients and showcase an augmented level of robustness in <b>few-shot</b> settings. In this paper, we prepend the low-rank modules into each <b>self-attention</b> layer of the model and employ two derivative-free optimization methods to optimize these low-rank modules at each layer alternately. Extensive results on various tasks and language models demonstrate that our proposed method achieves substantial improvement and exhibits clear advantages in memory usage and convergence speed compared to existing gradient-based parameter-efficient tuning and derivative-free optimization methods in <b>few-shot</b> settings.

**ABSTRACT**  
Decoding language from brain dynamics is an important open direction in the realm of brain-computer interface (BCI), especially considering the rapid growth of <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models.</b> Compared to invasive-based signals which require electrode implantation surgery, non-invasive neural signals (e.g. EEG, MEG) have attracted increasing attention considering their safety and generality. However, the exploration is not adequate in three aspects: 1) previous methods mainly focus on EEG but none of the previous works address this problem on MEG with better signal quality; 2) prior works have predominantly used ``teacher-forcing" during generative decoding, which is impractical; 3) prior works are mostly ``BART-based" not fully auto-regressive, which performs better in other sequence tasks. In this paper, we explore the brain-to-text translation of MEG signals in a speech-decoding formation. Here we are the first to investigate a cross-attention-based ``whisper" model for generating text directly from MEG signals without teacher forcing. Our model achieves impressive <b>BLEU-1</b> scores of 60.30 and 52.89 without pretraining \& teacher-forcing on two major datasets (\textit{GWilliams} and \textit{Schoffelen}). This paper conducts a comprehensive review to understand how speech decoding formation performs on the neural decoding tasks, including pretraining initialization, training \& evaluation set splitting, augmentation, and <b>scaling</b> <b>law.</b>

**ABSTRACT**  
Webpage entity extraction is a fundamental natural language processing task in both research and applications. Nowadays, the majority of webpage entity extraction models are trained on structured datasets which strive to retain textual content and its structure information. However, existing datasets all overlook the rich hypertext features (e.g., font color, font size) which show their effectiveness in previous works. To this end, we first collect a \textbf{H}ypertext \textbf{E}ntity \textbf{E}xtraction \textbf{D}ataset (\textit{HEED}) from the e-commerce domains, scraping both the text and the corresponding explicit hypertext features with high-quality manual entity annotations. Furthermore, we present the \textbf{Mo}E-based \textbf{E}ntity \textbf{E}xtraction \textbf{F}ramework (\textit{MoEEF}), which efficiently integrates multiple features to enhance model performance by Mixture of Experts and outperforms strong baselines, including the state-of-the-art small-scale models and <b>GPT-3.5-turbo.</b> Moreover, the effectiveness of hypertext features in \textit{HEED} and several model components in \textit{MoEEF} are analyzed.

**ABSTRACT**  
Document-level <b>Relation</b> <b>Extraction</b> (DocRE) aims to identify <b>relation</b> <b>labels</b> between entities within a single document. It requires handling several sentences and <b>reasoning</b> over them. State-of-the-art DocRE methods use a <b>graph</b> structure to connect entities across the document to capture dependency syntax information. However, this is insufficient to fully exploit the rich syntax information in the document. In this work, we propose to fuse constituency and dependency syntax into DocRE. It uses constituency syntax to aggregate the whole sentence information and select the instructive sentences for the pairs of targets. It exploits the dependency syntax in a <b>graph</b> structure with constituency syntax enhancement and chooses the path between entity pairs based on the dependency <b>graph.</b> The experimental results on datasets from various domains demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The code is publicly available at this url.

**ABSTRACT**  
The African continent lacks enough qualified teachers which hampers the provision of adequate learning support. An AI could potentially augment the efforts of the limited number of teachers, leading to better learning outcomes. Towards that end, this work describes and evaluates the first key output for the NSMQ AI Grand Challenge, which proposes a robust, real-world <b>benchmark</b> for such an AI: "Build an AI to compete live in Ghana's National Science and Maths Quiz (NSMQ) competition and win - performing better than the best contestants in all rounds and stages of the competition". The NSMQ is an annual live science and mathematics competition for senior secondary school students in Ghana in which 3 teams of 2 students compete by answering <b>questions</b> <b>across</b> biology, chemistry, physics, and math in 5 rounds over 5 progressive stages until a winning team is crowned for that year. In this work, we built Brilla AI, an AI contestant that we deployed to unofficially compete remotely and live in the Riddles round of the 2023 NSMQ Grand Finale, the first of its kind in the 30-year history of the competition. Brilla AI is currently available as a web app that livestreams the Riddles round of the contest, and runs 4 machine learning systems: (1) speech to text (2) <b>question</b> <b>extraction</b> (3) <b>question</b> <b>answering</b> and (4) text to speech that work together in real-time to quickly and accurately provide an answer, and then say it with a Ghanaian accent. In its debut, our AI answered one of the 4 riddles ahead of the 3 human contesting teams, unofficially placing second (tied). Improvements and extensions of this AI could potentially be deployed to offer science tutoring to students and eventually enable millions across Africa to have one-on-one learning interactions, democratizing science education.

**ABSTRACT**  
The pretrain-finetune paradigm represents a transformative approach in natural language processing (NLP). This paradigm distinguishes itself through the use of large <b>pretrained</b> <b>language</b> <b>models,</b> demonstrating remarkable efficiency in <b>finetuning</b> tasks, even with limited training data. This efficiency is especially beneficial for research in social sciences, where the number of annotated samples is often quite limited. Our tutorial offers a comprehensive introduction to the pretrain-finetune paradigm. We first delve into the fundamental concepts of pretraining and <b>finetuning,</b> followed by practical exercises using real-world applications. We demonstrate the application of the paradigm across various tasks, including multi-class classification and regression. Emphasizing its efficacy and user-friendliness, the tutorial aims to encourage broader adoption of this paradigm. To this end, we have provided open access to all our code and datasets. The tutorial is particularly valuable for quantitative researchers in psychology, offering them an insightful guide into this innovative approach.

**ABSTRACT**  
Natural language processing research has begun to embrace the notion of annotator subjectivity, motivated by variations in labelling. This approach understands each annotator's view as valid, which can be highly suitable for tasks that embed subjectivity, e.g., <b>sentiment</b> <b>analysis.</b> However, this construction may be inappropriate for tasks such as <b>hate</b> <b>speech</b> <b>detection,</b> as it affords equal validity to all positions on e.g., sexism or racism. We argue that the conflation of <b>hate</b> <b>and</b> <b>offence</b> can invalidate findings on <b>hate</b> <b>speech,</b> <b>and</b> call for future work to be situated in theory, disentangling <b>hate</b> <b>from</b> <b>its</b> orthogonal concept, offence.

**ABSTRACT**  
We present INDICVOICES, a dataset of natural and spontaneous speech containing a total of 7348 hours of read (9%), extempore (74%) and conversational (17%) audio from 16237 speakers covering 145 Indian districts and 22 languages. Of these 7348 hours, 1639 hours have already been transcribed, with a median of 73 hours per language. Through this paper, we share our journey of capturing the cultural, linguistic and demographic diversity of India to create a one-of-its-kind inclusive and representative dataset. More specifically, we share an open-source blueprint for data collection at scale comprising of standardised protocols, centralised tools, a repository of engaging questions, <b>prompts</b> and conversation scenarios spanning multiple domains and topics of interest, quality control mechanisms, comprehensive transcription guidelines and transcription tools. We hope that this open source blueprint will serve as a comprehensive starter kit for data collection efforts in other multilingual regions of the world. Using INDICVOICES, we build IndicASR, the first <b>ASR</b> model to support all the 22 languages listed in the 8th schedule of the Constitution of India. All the data, tools, guidelines, models and other materials developed as a part of this work will be made publicly available

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Sentiment</b> <b>analysis</b> (SA) has been, and is still, a thriving research area. However, the task of Arabic <b>sentiment</b> <b>analysis</b> (ASA) is still underrepresented in the body of research. This study offers the first in-depth and in-breadth analysis of existing ASA studies of textual content and identifies their common themes, domains of application, methods, approaches, technologies and algorithms used. The in-depth study manually analyses 133 ASA papers published in the English language between 2002 and 2020 from four academic databases (SAGE, IEEE, Springer, WILEY) and from Google Scholar. The in-breadth study uses modern, automatic machine learning techniques, such as topic modelling and temporal analysis, on Open Access resources, to reinforce themes and trends identified by the prior study, on 2297 ASA publications between 2010-2020. The main findings show the different approaches used for ASA: machine learning, lexicon-based and hybrid approaches. Other findings include ASA 'winning' algorithms (SVM, NB, hybrid methods). Deep learning methods, such as <b>LSTM</b> can provide higher accuracy, but for ASA sometimes the corpora are not large enough to support them. Additionally, whilst there are some ASA corpora and lexicons, more are required. Specifically, Arabic tweets corpora and datasets are currently only moderately sized. Moreover, Arabic lexicons that have high coverage contain only Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) words, and those with Arabic dialects are quite small. Thus, new corpora need to be created. On the other hand, ASA tools are stringently lacking. There is a need to develop ASA tools that can be used in industry, as well as in academia, for Arabic text SA. Hence, our study offers insights into the challenges associated with ASA research and provides suggestions for ways to move the field forward such as lack of Dialectical Arabic resource, Arabic tweets, corpora and data sets for SA.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Large</b> <b>Language</b> <b>Models(LLMs)</b> have dramatically revolutionized the field of Natural Language Processing(NLP), offering remarkable capabilities that have garnered widespread usage. However, existing interaction paradigms between <b>LLMs</b> and users are constrained by either inflexibility, limitations in customization, or a lack of persistent learning. This inflexibility is particularly evident as users, especially those without programming skills, have restricted avenues to enhance or personalize the model. Existing frameworks further complicate the model training and deployment process due to their computational inefficiencies and lack of user-friendly interfaces. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces a novel interaction paradigm-'Online Training using External Interactions'-that merges the benefits of persistent, real-time model updates with the flexibility for individual customization through external interactions such as AI agents or online/offline knowledge bases.

**ABSTRACT**  
The transferability of deep neural networks (DNNs) has made significant progress in image and language processing. However, due to the heterogeneity among tables, such DNN bonus is still far from being well exploited on tabular data prediction (e.g., regression or classification tasks). Condensing knowledge from diverse domains, language models (LMs) possess the capability to comprehend feature names from various tables, potentially serving as versatile learners in transferring knowledge across distinct tables and diverse prediction tasks, but their discrete text representation space is inherently incompatible with numerical feature values in tables. In this paper, we present TP-BERTa, a specifically <b>pre-trained</b> <b>LM</b> <b>model</b> for tabular data prediction. Concretely, a novel relative magnitude <b>tokenization</b> converts scalar numerical feature values to finely discrete, high-dimensional tokens, and an intra-feature attention approach integrates feature values with the corresponding feature names. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our <b>pre-trained</b> <b>TP-BERTa</b> <b>leads</b> the performance among tabular DNNs and is competitive with Gradient Boosted Decision Tree models in typical tabular data regime.

**ABSTRACT**  
Aviation safety is paramount in the modern world, with a continuous commitment to reducing accidents and improving safety standards. Central to this endeavor is the analysis of aviation accident reports, rich textual resources that hold insights into the causes and contributing factors behind aviation mishaps. This paper compares two prominent <b>topic</b> <b>modeling</b> techniques, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), in the context of aviation accident report analysis. The study leverages the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) Dataset with the primary objective of automating and streamlining the process of identifying latent themes and patterns within accident reports. The Coherence Value (C_v) metric was used to evaluate the quality of generated <b>topics.</b> <b>LDA</b> demonstrates higher <b>topic</b> <b>coherence,</b> indicating stronger semantic relevance among words within <b>topics.</b> <b>At</b> the same time, NMF excelled in producing distinct and granular <b>topics,</b> <b>enabling</b> a more focused analysis of specific aspects of aviation accidents.

**ABSTRACT**  
Knowledge-grounded <b>dialogue</b> <b>systems</b> aim to generate coherent and engaging responses based on the <b>dialogue</b> <b>contexts</b> and selected external knowledge. Previous knowledge selection methods tend to rely too heavily on the <b>dialogue</b> <b>contexts</b> or over-emphasize the new information in the selected knowledge, resulting in the selection of repetitious or incongruous knowledge and further generating repetitive or incoherent responses, as the generation of the response depends on the chosen knowledge. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a Coherent and Engaging Topic Transition (CET2) framework to model topic transitions for selecting knowledge that is coherent to the context of the conversations while providing adequate knowledge diversity for topic development. Our CET2 framework considers multiple factors for knowledge selection, including valid transition logic from <b>dialogue</b> <b>contexts</b> to the following topics and systematic comparisons between available knowledge candidates. Extensive experiments on two public <b>benchmarks</b> demonstrate the superiority and the better generalization ability of CET2 on knowledge selection. This is due to our well-designed transition features and comparative knowledge selection strategy, which are more transferable to conversations about unseen topics. Analysis of fine-grained knowledge selection accuracy also shows that CET2 can better balance topic entailment (contextual coherence) and development (knowledge diversity) in <b>dialogue</b> <b>than</b> existing approaches.

**ABSTRACT**  
The purpose of this feasibility study was to examine the potential impact of reading digital interactive e-books on essential skills that support reading comprehension with third-fifth grade students. Students read two e-Books that taught word learning and comprehension monitoring strategies in the service of learning difficult vocabulary and targeted science concepts about hurricanes. We investigated whether specific comprehension strategies including word learning and strategies that supported general reading comprehension, <b>summarization,</b> and question generation, show promise of effectiveness in building vocabulary knowledge and comprehension skills in the e-Books. Students were assigned to read one of three versions of each of the e-Books, each version implemented one strategy. The books employed a choose-your-adventure format with embedded comprehension questions that provided students with immediate feedback on their responses. Paired samples t-tests were run to examine pre-to-post differences in learning the targeted vocabulary and science concepts taught in both e-Books. For both e-Books, students demonstrated significant gains in word learning and on the targeted hurricane concepts. Additionally, Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) revealed that no one strategy was more associated with larger gains than the other. Performance on the embedded questions in the books was also associated with greater posttest outcomes for both e-Books. This work discusses important considerations for implementation and future development of e-books that can enhance student engagement and improve reading comprehension.

**ABSTRACT**  
This study addresses the task of Unknown Sense Detection in English and Swedish. The primary objective of this task is to determine whether the meaning of a particular word usage is documented in a dictionary or not. For this purpose, sense entries are compared with word usages from modern and historical corpora using a pre-trained Word-in-Context embedder that allows us to model this task in a <b>few-shot</b> scenario. Additionally, we use human annotations to adapt and evaluate our models. Compared to a random sample from a corpus, our model is able to considerably increase the detected number of word usages with non-recorded senses.

**ABSTRACT**  
Evaluating the theory of mind (ToM) capabilities of language models (LMs) has recently received much attention. However, many existing <b>benchmarks</b> rely on synthetic data which risks misaligning the resulting experiments with human behavior. We introduce the first ToM dataset based on naturally occurring spoken dialogs, Common-ToM, and show that LMs struggle to demonstrate ToM. We then show that integrating a simple, explicit representation of beliefs improves LM performance on Common-ToM.

**ABSTRACT**  
Architectural Knowledge Management (AKM) involves the organized handling of information related to architectural decisions and design within a project or organization. An essential artifact of AKM is the Architecture Decision Records (ADR), which documents key design decisions. ADRs are documents that capture decision context, decision made and various aspects related to a design decision, thereby promoting transparency, collaboration, and understanding. Despite their benefits, ADR adoption in software development has been slow due to challenges like time constraints and inconsistent uptake. Recent advancements in <b>Large</b> <b>Language</b> <b>Models</b> <b>(LLMs)</b> may help bridge this adoption gap by facilitating ADR generation. However, the effectiveness of <b>LLM</b> for ADR generation or understanding is something that has not been explored. To this end, in this work, we perform an exploratory study that aims to investigate the feasibility of using <b>LLM</b> for the generation of ADRs given the decision context. In our exploratory study, we utilize <b>GPT</b> and <b>T5-based</b> models with 0-shot, <b>few-shot,</b> and <b>fine-tuning</b> approaches to generate the Decision of an ADR given its Context. Our results indicate that in a 0-shot setting, state-of-the-art models such as <b>GPT-4</b> generate relevant and accurate Design Decisions, although they fall short of human-level performance. Additionally, we observe that more cost-effective models like <b>GPT-3.5</b> can achieve similar outcomes in a <b>few-shot</b> setting, and smaller models such as Flan-T5 can yield comparable results after <b>fine-tuning.</b> To conclude, this exploratory study suggests that <b>LLM</b> can generate Design Decisions, but further research is required to attain human-level generation and establish standardized widespread adoption.

**ABSTRACT**  
Automated Program Repair (APR) aims to automatically generate patches for rectifying software bugs. Recent strides in <b>Large</b> <b>Language</b> <b>Models</b> <b>(LLM),</b> such as <b>ChatGPT,</b> have yielded encouraging outcomes in APR, especially within the conversation-driven APR framework. Nevertheless, the efficacy of conversation-driven APR is contingent on the quality of the feedback information. In this paper, we propose ContrastRepair, a novel conversation-based APR approach that augments conversation-driven APR by providing <b>LLMs</b> with contrastive test pairs. A test pair consists of a failing test and a passing test, which offer contrastive feedback to the <b>LLM.</b> Our key insight is to minimize the difference between the generated passing test and the given failing test, which can better isolate the root causes of bugs. By providing informative and specific feedback, ContrastRepair enables the <b>LLM</b> to produce effective bug fixes. The implementation of ContrastRepair is based on the state-of-the-art <b>LLM,</b> <b>ChatGPT,</b> and it iteratively interacts with <b>ChatGPT</b> until plausible patches are generated. We evaluate ContrastRepair on multiple <b>benchmark</b> datasets, including Defects4j, QuixBugs, and HumanEval-Java. The results demonstrate that ContrastRepair significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving a new state-of-the-art in program repair. For instance, among Defects4j 1.2 and 2.0, ContrastRepair correctly repairs 143 out of all 337 bug cases, while the best-performing baseline fixes 124 bugs.

**ABSTRACT**  
People enjoy sharing "notes" including their experiences within online communities. Therefore, recommending notes aligned with user interests has become a crucial task. Existing online methods only input notes into <b>BERT-based</b> models to generate note embeddings for assessing similarity. However, they may underutilize some important cues, e.g., hashtags or categories, which represent the key concepts of notes. Indeed, learning to generate hashtags/categories can potentially enhance note embeddings, both of which compress key note information into limited content. Besides, <b>Large</b> <b>Language</b> <b>Models</b> <b>(LLMs)</b> have significantly outperformed <b>BERT</b> in understanding natural languages. It is promising to introduce <b>LLMs</b> into note <b>recommendation.</b> In this paper, we propose a novel unified framework called NoteLLM, which leverages <b>LLMs</b> to address the item-to-item (I2I) note <b>recommendation.</b> Specifically, we utilize Note Compression <b>Prompt</b> to compress a note into a single special token, and further learn the potentially related notes' embeddings via a <b>contrastive</b> <b>learning</b> approach. Moreover, we use NoteLLM to <b>summarize</b> the note and generate the hashtag/category automatically through <b>instruction</b> <b>tuning.</b> Extensive validations on real scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method compared with the online baseline and show major improvements in the <b>recommendation</b> system of Xiaohongshu.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Information</b> <b>retrieval</b> models have witnessed a paradigm shift from <b>unsupervised</b> statistical approaches to feature-based <b>supervised</b> approaches to completely data-driven ones that make use of the pre-training of <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models.</b> While the increasing complexity of the search models have been able to demonstrate improvements in effectiveness (measured in terms of relevance of top-retrieved results), a question worthy of a thorough inspection is - "how explainable are these models?", which is what this paper aims to evaluate. In particular, we propose a common evaluation platform to systematically evaluate the explainability of any ranking model (the explanation algorithm being identical for all the models that are to be evaluated). In our proposed framework, each model, in addition to returning a ranked list of documents, also requires to return a list of explanation units or rationales for each document. This meta-information from each document is then used to measure how locally consistent these rationales are as an intrinsic measure of interpretability - one that does not require manual relevance assessments. Additionally, as an extrinsic measure, we compute how relevant these rationales are by leveraging sub-document level relevance assessments. Our findings show a number of interesting observations, such as sentence-level rationales are more consistent, an increase in complexity mostly leads to less consistent explanations, and that interpretability measures offer a complementary dimension of evaluation of IR systems because consistency is not well-correlated with nDCG at top ranks.

**ABSTRACT**  
Automatic Compliance Checking (ACC) within the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) sector necessitates automating the interpretation of building regulations to achieve its full potential. However, extracting <b>information</b> <b>from</b> textual rules to convert them to a machine-readable format has been a challenge due to the complexities associated with natural language and the limited resources that can support advanced machine-learning techniques. To address this challenge, we introduce CODE-ACCORD, a unique dataset compiled under the EU Horizon ACCORD project. CODE-ACCORD comprises 862 self-contained sentences extracted from the building regulations of England and Finland. Aligned with our core objective of facilitating <b>information</b> <b>extraction</b> from <b>text</b> <b>for</b> machine-readable rule generation, each sentence was annotated with entities and <b>relations.</b> <b>Entities</b> represent specific components such as "window" and "smoke detectors", while <b>relations</b> <b>denote</b> semantic associations between these entities, collectively capturing the conveyed ideas in natural language. We manually annotated all the sentences using a group of 12 annotators. Each sentence underwent annotations by multiple annotators and subsequently careful data curation to finalise annotations, ensuring their accuracy and reliability, thereby establishing the dataset as a solid ground truth. CODE-ACCORD offers a rich resource for diverse machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) related tasks in ACC, including <b>text</b> <b>classification,</b> entity recognition and <b>relation</b> <b>extraction.</b> To the best of our knowledge, this is the first entity and <b>relation-annotated</b> <b>dataset</b> in compliance checking, which is also publicly available.

**ABSTRACT**  
Nano-machines circulating inside the human body, collecting data on tissue conditions, represent a vital part of next-generation medical diagnostic systems. However, for these devices to operate effectively, they need to relay not only their medical measurements but also their positions. This paper introduces a novel localization method for in-body nano-machines based on the magnetic field, leveraging the advantageous magnetic permeability of all human tissues. The entire proposed localization system is described, starting from 10x10 ${\mu}m^2$ magnetometers to be integrated into the nano-machines, to a set of external wires generating the magnetic field. Mathematical equations for the localization algorithm are also provided, assuming the nano-machines do not execute the computations themselves, but transmit their magnetic field measurements together with medical data outside of the body. The whole system is validated with computer <b>simulations</b> that capture the measurement error of the magnetometers, the error induced by the Earth magnetic field, and a human body model assuming different possible positions of nano-machines. The results show a very high system accuracy with localization errors even below 1 cm.

**ABSTRACT**  
Citing comprehensively and appropriately has become a challenging task with the explosive growth of scientific publications. Current citation <b>recommendation</b> systems aim to recommend a list of scientific papers for a given text context or a draft paper. However, none of the existing work focuses on already included citations of full papers, which are imperfect and still have much room for improvement. In the scenario of peer reviewing, it is a common phenomenon that submissions are identified as missing vital citations by reviewers. This may lead to a negative impact on the credibility and validity of the research presented. To help improve citations of full papers, we first define a novel task of Recommending Missed Citations Identified by Reviewers (RMC) and construct a corresponding expert-labeled dataset called CitationR. We conduct an extensive evaluation of several state-of-the-art methods on CitationR. Furthermore, we propose a new framework RMCNet with an Attentive Reference Encoder module mining the relevance between papers, already-made citations, and missed citations. Empirical results prove that RMC is challenging, with the proposed architecture outperforming previous methods in all metrics. We release our dataset and <b>benchmark</b> models to motivate future research on this challenging new task.

**ABSTRACT**  
AI <b>Large</b> <b>Language</b> <b>Models</b> <b>(LLMs)</b> like <b>ChatGPT</b> are set to reshape some aspects of policymaking processes. Policy practitioners are already using <b>ChatGPT</b> for help with a variety of tasks: from drafting statements, submissions, and presentations, to conducting background research. We are cautiously hopeful that <b>LLMs</b> could be used to promote a marginally more balanced footing among decision makers in policy negotiations by assisting with certain tedious work, particularly benefiting developing countries who face capacity constraints that put them at a disadvantage in negotiations. However, the risks are particularly concerning for environmental and marine policy uses, due to the urgency of crises like climate change, high uncertainty, and trans-boundary impact. To explore the realistic potentials, limitations, and equity risks for <b>LLMs</b> in marine policymaking, we present a case study of an AI <b>chatbot</b> for the recently adopted Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction Agreement (BBNJ), and critique its answers to key policy <b>questions.</b> <b>Our</b> case study demonstrates the dangers of <b>LLMs</b> in marine policymaking via their potential bias towards generating text that favors the perspectives of mainly Western economic centers of power, while neglecting developing countries' viewpoints. We describe several ways these biases can enter the system, including: (1) biases in the underlying foundational language models; (2) biases arising from the <b>chatbot's</b> connection to UN negotiation documents, and (3) biases arising from the application design. We urge caution in the use of <b>generative</b> <b>AI</b> in ocean policy processes and call for more research on its equity and <b>fairness</b> implications. Our work also underscores the need for developing countries' policymakers to develop the technical capacity to engage with AI on their own terms.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recent <b>text-to-image</b> (T2I) models have had great success, and many <b>benchmarks</b> have been proposed to evaluate their performance and safety. However, they only consider explicit <b>prompts</b> while neglecting implicit <b>prompts</b> (hint at a target without explicitly mentioning it). These <b>prompts</b> may get rid of safety constraints and pose potential threats to the applications of these models. This position paper highlights the current state of T2I models toward implicit <b>prompts.</b> We present a <b>benchmark</b> named ImplicitBench and conduct an investigation on the performance and impacts of implicit <b>prompts</b> with popular T2I models. Specifically, we design and collect more than 2,000 implicit <b>prompts</b> of three aspects: General Symbols, Celebrity Privacy, and Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW) Issues, and evaluate six well-known T2I models' capabilities under these implicit <b>prompts.</b> Experiment results show that (1) T2I models are able to accurately create various target symbols indicated by implicit <b>prompts;</b> (2) Implicit <b>prompts</b> bring potential risks of privacy leakage for T2I models. (3) Constraints of NSFW in most of the evaluated T2I models can be bypassed with implicit <b>prompts.</b> We call for increased attention to the potential and risks of implicit <b>prompts</b> in the T2I community and further investigation into the capabilities and impacts of implicit <b>prompts,</b> advocating for a balanced approach that harnesses their benefits while mitigating their risks.

**ABSTRACT**  
Contestability -- the ability to effectively challenge a decision -- is critical to the implementation of <b>fairness.</b> In the context of governmental decision making about individuals, contestability is often constitutionally required as an element of due process; specific procedures may be required by state or federal law relevant to a particular program. In addition, contestability can be a valuable way to discover systemic errors, contributing to ongoing assessments and system improvement. On January 24-25, 2024, with support from the National Science Foundation and the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, we convened a diverse group of government officials, representatives of leading technology companies, technology and policy experts from academia and the non-profit sector, advocates, and stakeholders for a workshop on advanced automated decision making, contestability, and the law. Informed by the workshop's rich and wide-ranging discussion, we offer these <b>recommendations.</b> A full report summarizing the discussion is in preparation.

**ABSTRACT**  
Existing explanation results of functional connectivity (FC) are normally generated by using classification result labels and correlation analysis methods such as Pearson's correlation or gradient backward. However, the diagnostic model is still trained on the <b>black</b> <b>box</b> model and might lack the attention of FCs in important regions during the training. To enhance the explainability and improve diagnostic performance, providing prior knowledge on neurodegeneration-related regions when healthy subjects (HC) develop into subject cognitive decline (SCD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) for the diagnostic model is a key step. To better determine the neurodegeneration-related regions, we employ <b>counterfactual</b> <b>reasoning</b> to generate the target label FC matrices derived from source label FC and then subtract source label FC with target label FC. The <b>counterfactual</b> <b>reasoning</b> architecture is constructed by adaptive forward and backward <b>transformer</b> <b>generative</b> <b>adversarial</b> <b>network</b> (AFBT <b>GAN),</b> which is specifically designed by network property in FC and inverse patch embedding operation in the <b>transformer.</b> The specific design can make the model focus more on the current network correlation and employ the global insight of the <b>transformer</b> to reconstruct FC, which both help the generation of high-quality target label FC. The validation experiments are conducted on both clinical and public datasets, the generated attention map are both vital correlated to cognitive function and the diagnostic performance is also significant. The code is available at https://github.com/SXR3015/AFBT-GAN.

**ABSTRACT**  
Realizing sufficient separability between the distributions of healthy and pathological samples is a critical obstacle for pathology detection <b>convolutional</b> models. Moreover, these models exhibit a bias for contrast-based images, with diminished performance on texture-based medical images. This study introduces the notion of a population-level context for pathology detection and employs a <b>graph</b> theoretic approach to model and incorporate it into the latent code of an <b>autoencoder</b> via a refinement module we term PopuSense. PopuSense seeks to capture additional intra-group variations inherent in biomedical data that a local or global context of the <b>convolutional</b> model might miss or smooth out. Experiments on contrast-based and texture-based images, with minimal adaptation, encounter the existing preference for intensity-based input. Nevertheless, PopuSense demonstrates improved separability in contrast-based images, presenting an additional avenue for refining representations learned by a model.

**ABSTRACT**  
Deep learning (DL)-based methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance for a wide range of medical image segmentation tasks. Nevertheless, recent studies show that deep neural networks (DNNs) can be miscalibrated and overconfident, leading to "silent failures" that are risky} for clinical applications. Bayesian statistics provide an intuitive approach to DL failure detection, based on posterior probability estimation. However, Bayesian DL, and in particular the posterior estimation, is intractable for large medical image segmentation DNNs. To tackle this challenge, we propose a Bayesian learning framework by Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), tempered by cold posterior (CP) to accommodate medical <b>data</b> <b>augmentation,</b> named HMC-CP. For HMC computation, we further propose a cyclical annealing strategy, which captures both local and global geometries of the posterior distribution, enabling highly efficient Bayesian DNN training with the same computational budget requirements as training a single DNN. The resulting Bayesian DNN outputs an ensemble segmentation along with the segmentation uncertainty. We evaluate the proposed HMC-CP extensively on cardiac magnetic resonance image (MRI) segmentation, using in-domain steady-state free precession (SSFP) cine images as well as <b>out-of-domain</b> datasets of quantitative $T_1$ and $T_2$ mapping.

**ABSTRACT**  
Distortions caused by low-light conditions are not only visually unpleasant but also degrade the performance of computer vision tasks. The restoration and enhancement have proven to be highly beneficial. However, there are only a limited number of enhancement methods explicitly designed for videos acquired in low-light conditions. We propose a Spatio-Temporal Aligned SUNet (STA-SUNet) model using a Swin <b>Transformer</b> as a backbone to capture low light video features and exploit their spatio-temporal correlations. The STA-SUNet model is trained on a novel, fully registered dataset (BVI), which comprises dynamic scenes captured under varying light conditions. It is further analysed comparatively against various other models over three test datasets. The model demonstrates superior adaptivity across all datasets, obtaining the highest PSNR and SSIM values. It is particularly effective in extreme low-light conditions, yielding fairly good visualisation results.

**ABSTRACT**  
Detection and diagnosis of colon polyps are key to preventing colorectal cancer. Recent evidence suggests that AI-based computer-aided detection (CADe) and computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) systems can enhance endoscopists' performance and boost colonoscopy effectiveness. However, most available public datasets primarily consist of still images or video clips, often at a down-sampled resolution, and do not accurately represent real-world colonoscopy procedures. We introduce the REAL-Colon (Real-world multi-center Endoscopy Annotated video Library) dataset: a compilation of 2.7M native video frames from sixty full-resolution, real-world colonoscopy recordings across multiple centers. The dataset contains 350k bounding-box annotations, each created under the supervision of expert gastroenterologists. Comprehensive patient clinical data, colonoscopy acquisition information, and polyp histopathological information are also included in each video. With its unprecedented size, quality, and heterogeneity, the REAL-Colon dataset is a unique resource for researchers and developers aiming to advance AI research in colonoscopy. Its openness and transparency facilitate rigorous and reproducible research, fostering the development and <b>benchmarking</b> of more accurate and reliable colonoscopy-related algorithms and models.

**ABSTRACT**  
Light field cameras and multi-camera arrays have emerged as promising solutions for accurately estimating depth by passively capturing light information. This is possible because the 3D information of a scene is embedded in the 4D light field <b>geometry.</b> Commonly, depth estimation methods extract this information relying on gradient information, heuristic-based optimisation models, or learning-based approaches. This paper focuses mainly on explicitly understanding and exploiting 4D geometrical cues for light field depth estimation. Thus, a novel method is proposed, based on a non-learning-based optimisation approach for depth estimation that explicitly considers surface normal accuracy and occlusion regions by utilising a fully explainable 4D geometric model of the light field. The 4D model performs depth/disparity estimation by determining the orientations and analysing the intersections of key 2D planes in 4D space, which are the images of 3D-space points in the 4D light field. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms both learning-based and non-learning-based state-of-the-art methods in terms of surface normal angle accuracy, achieving a Median Angle Error on planar surfaces, on average, 26.3\% lower than the state-of-the-art, and still being competitive with state-of-the-art methods in terms of Mean Squared Error $\vc{\times}$ 100 and Badpix 0.07.

**ABSTRACT**  
Vision language models (VLMs) have experienced rapid advancements through the integration of <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> <b>(LLMs)</b> with <b>image-text</b> pairs, yet they struggle with detailed regional visual understanding due to limited spatial awareness of the vision encoder, and the use of coarse-grained training data that lacks detailed, region-specific captions. To address this, we introduce RegionGPT (short as RGPT), a novel framework designed for complex region-level captioning and understanding. RGPT enhances the spatial awareness of regional representation with simple yet effective modifications to existing visual encoders in VLMs. We further improve performance on tasks requiring a specific output scope by integrating task-guided instruction <b>prompts</b> during both training and inference phases, while maintaining the model's versatility for general-purpose tasks. Additionally, we develop an automated region caption data generation pipeline, enriching the training set with detailed region-level captions. We demonstrate that a universal RGPT model can be effectively applied and significantly enhancing performance across a range of region-level tasks, including but not limited to complex region descriptions, <b>reasoning,</b> object classification, and referring expressions comprehension.

**ABSTRACT**  
Popular methods usually use a degradation model in a <b>supervised</b> way to learn a watermark removal model. However, it is true that reference images are difficult to obtain in the real world, as well as collected images by cameras suffer from noise. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose a perceptive <b>self-supervised</b> <b>learning</b> network for noisy image watermark removal (PSLNet) in this paper. PSLNet depends on a parallel network to remove noise and watermarks. The upper network uses task decomposition ideas to remove noise and watermarks in sequence. The lower network utilizes the degradation model idea to simultaneously remove noise and watermarks. Specifically, mentioned paired watermark images are obtained in a self <b>supervised</b> way, and paired noisy images (i.e., noisy and reference images) are obtained in a <b>supervised</b> way. To enhance the clarity of obtained images, interacting two sub-networks and fusing obtained clean images are used to improve the effects of image watermark removal in terms of structural information and pixel enhancement. Taking into texture information account, a mixed loss uses obtained images and features to achieve a robust model of noisy image watermark removal. Comprehensive experiments show that our proposed method is very effective in comparison with popular <b>convolutional</b> <b>neural</b> <b>networks</b> <b>(CNNs)</b> for noisy image watermark removal. Codes can be obtained at https://github.com/hellloxiaotian/PSLNet.

**ABSTRACT**  
Academic documents are packed with texts, equations, tables, and figures, requiring comprehensive understanding for accurate <b>Optical</b> <b>Character</b> <b>Recognition</b> <b>(OCR).</b> While end-to-end <b>OCR</b> methods offer improved accuracy over layout-based approaches, they often grapple with significant repetition issues, especially with complex layouts in <b>Out-Of-Domain</b> (OOD) documents.To tackle this issue, we propose LOCR, a model that integrates location guiding into the <b>transformer</b> architecture during autoregression. We train the model on a dataset comprising over 77M text-location pairs from 125K academic document pages, including bounding boxes for words, tables and mathematical symbols. LOCR adeptly handles various formatting elements and generates content in Markdown language. It outperforms all existing methods in our test set constructed from arXiv, as measured by edit distance, <b>BLEU,</b> METEOR and F-measure.LOCR also reduces repetition frequency from 4.4% of pages to 0.5% in the arXiv dataset, from 13.2% to 1.3% in OOD quantum physics documents and from 8.1% to 1.8% in OOD marketing documents. Additionally, LOCR features an interactive <b>OCR</b> mode, facilitating the generation of complex documents through a few location <b>prompts</b> from human.

**ABSTRACT**  
Video temporal <b>grounding</b> (VTG) aims to locate specific temporal segments from an untrimmed video based on a linguistic query. Most existing VTG models are trained on extensive annotated video-text pairs, a process that not only introduces human biases from the queries but also incurs significant computational costs. To tackle these challenges, we propose VTG-GPT, a <b>GPT-based</b> method for <b>zero-shot</b> VTG without training or <b>fine-tuning.</b> To reduce prejudice in the original query, we employ Baichuan2 to generate debiased queries. To lessen redundant information in videos, we apply MiniGPT-v2 to transform visual content into more precise captions. Finally, we devise the proposal generator and post-processing to produce accurate segments from debiased queries and image captions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VTG-GPT significantly outperforms SOTA methods in <b>zero-shot</b> settings and surpasses <b>unsupervised</b> approaches. More notably, it achieves competitive performance comparable to <b>supervised</b> methods. The code is available on https://github.com/YoucanBaby/VTG-GPT

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Multimodal</b> <b>Large</b> <b>Language</b> <b>Models</b> (MLLMs) have recently gained immense popularity. Powerful commercial models like <b>ChatGPT-4V</b> and <b>Gemini,</b> as well as open-source ones such as LLaVA, are essentially general-purpose models and are applied to solve a wide variety of tasks, including those in computer vision. These neural networks possess such strong general knowledge and <b>reasoning</b> abilities that they have proven capable of working even on tasks for which they were not specifically trained. We compared the capabilities of the most powerful MLLMs to date: ShareGPT4V, <b>ChatGPT,</b> LLaVA-Next in a specialized task of age and gender estimation with our state-of-the-art specialized model, MiVOLO. We also updated MiVOLO and provide details and new metrics in this article. This comparison has yielded some interesting results and insights about the strengths and weaknesses of the participating models. Furthermore, we attempted various ways to <b>fine-tune</b> the ShareGPT4V model for this specific task, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art results in this particular challenge. Although such a model would not be practical in production, as it is incredibly expensive compared to a specialized model like MiVOLO, it could be very useful in some tasks, like data annotation.

**ABSTRACT**  
Highlighting particularly relevant regions of an image can improve the performance of <b>vision-language</b> models (VLMs) on various <b>vision-language</b> (VL) tasks by guiding the model to attend more closely to these regions of interest. For example, VLMs can be given a "visual <b>prompt",</b> where visual markers such as bounding boxes delineate key image regions. However, current VLMs that can incorporate visual guidance are either proprietary and expensive or require costly training on curated data that includes visual <b>prompts.</b> We introduce Contrastive Region Guidance (CRG), a training-free guidance method that enables open-source VLMs to respond to visual <b>prompts.</b> CRG contrasts model outputs produced with and without visual <b>prompts,</b> factoring out biases revealed by the model when answering without the information required to produce a correct answer (i.e., the model's prior). CRG achieves substantial improvements in a wide variety of VL tasks: When region annotations are provided, CRG increases absolute accuracy by up to 11.1% on ViP-Bench, a collection of six diverse region-based tasks such as recognition, math, and object relationship <b>reasoning.</b> We also show CRG's applicability to spatial <b>reasoning,</b> with 10% improvement on What'sUp, as well as to compositional generalization -- improving accuracy by 11.5% and 7.5% on two challenging splits from SugarCrepe -- and to <b>image-text</b> alignment for generated images, where we improve by up to 8.4 AUROC and 6.8 F1 points on SeeTRUE. When reference regions are absent, CRG allows us to re-rank proposed regions in referring expression comprehension and phrase <b>grounding</b> <b>benchmarks</b> like RefCOCO/+/g and Flickr30K Entities, with an average gain of 3.2% in accuracy. Our analysis explores alternative masking strategies for CRG, quantifies CRG's probability shift, and evaluates the role of region guidance strength, empirically validating CRG's design choices.

**ABSTRACT**  
The Attention mechanism is the main component of the <b>Transformer</b> architecture, and since its introduction, it has led to significant advancements in Deep Learning that span many domains and multiple tasks. The Attention Mechanism was utilized in Computer <b>Vision</b> <b>as</b> the <b>Vision</b> <b>Transformer</b> ViT, and its usage has expanded into many tasks in the <b>vision</b> <b>domain,</b> such as classification, segmentation, <b>object</b> <b>detection,</b> and image generation. While this mechanism is very expressive and capable, it comes with the drawback of being computationally expensive and requiring datasets of considerable size for effective optimization. To address these shortcomings, many designs have been proposed in the literature to reduce the computational burden and alleviate the data size requirements. Examples of such attempts in the <b>vision</b> <b>domain</b> are the MLP-Mixer, the Conv-Mixer, the Perciver-IO, and many more. This paper introduces a new computational block as an alternative to the standard ViT block that reduces the compute burdens by replacing the normal Attention layers with a Network in Network structure that enhances the static approach of the MLP Mixer with a dynamic system of learning an element-wise <b>gating</b> function by a token mixing process. Extensive experimentation shows that the proposed design provides better performance than the baseline architectures on multiple datasets applied in the image classification task of the <b>vision</b> <b>domain.</b>

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Self-supervised</b> <b>pre-training</b> has been proved to be effective in learning transferable <b>representations</b> <b>that</b> benefit various visual tasks. This paper asks this question: can <b>self-supervised</b> <b>pre-training</b> learn general facial <b>representations</b> <b>for</b> various facial analysis tasks? Recent efforts toward this goal are limited to treating each face image as a whole, i.e., learning consistent facial <b>representations</b> <b>at</b> the image-level, which overlooks the consistency of local facial <b>representations</b> <b>(i.e.,</b> facial regions like eyes, nose, etc). In this work, we make a first attempt to propose a novel <b>self-supervised</b> <b>facial</b> <b>representation</b> <b>learning</b> framework to learn consistent global and local facial <b>representations,</b> <b>Facial</b> Region Awareness (FRA). Specifically, we explicitly enforce the consistency of facial regions by matching the local facial <b>representations</b> <b>across</b> views, which are extracted with learned heatmaps highlighting the facial regions. Inspired by the mask prediction in <b>supervised</b> semantic segmentation, we obtain the heatmaps via cosine similarity between the per-pixel projection of feature maps and facial mask embeddings computed from learnable positional embeddings, which leverage the attention mechanism to globally look up the facial image for facial regions. To learn such heatmaps, we formulate the learning of facial mask embeddings as a deep <b>clustering</b> problem by assigning the pixel features from the feature maps to them. The <b>transfer</b> <b>learning</b> results on facial classification and regression tasks show that our FRA outperforms previous pre-trained models and more importantly, using ResNet as the unified backbone for various tasks, our FRA achieves comparable or even better performance compared with SOTA methods in facial analysis tasks.

**ABSTRACT**  
Hyperspectral images (HSI) <b>clustering</b> is an important but challenging task. The state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods usually rely on superpixels, however, they do not fully utilize the spatial and spectral information in HSI 3-D structure, and their optimization targets are not <b>clustering-oriented.</b> In this work, we first use 3-D and 2-D hybrid <b>convolutional</b> <b>neural</b> <b>networks</b> to extract the high-order spatial and spectral features of HSI through pre-training, and then design a superpixel <b>graph</b> <b>contrastive</b> <b>clustering</b> (SPGCC) model to learn discriminative superpixel representations. Reasonable augmented views are crucial for <b>contrastive</b> <b>clustering,</b> and conventional <b>contrastive</b> <b>learning</b> may hurt the cluster structure since different samples are pushed away in the embedding space even if they belong to the same class. In SPGCC, we design two semantic-invariant <b>data</b> <b>augmentations</b> for HSI superpixels: pixel sampling augmentation and model weight augmentation. Then sample-level alignment and <b>clustering-center-level</b> contrast are performed for better intra-class similarity and inter-class dissimilarity of superpixel embeddings. We perform <b>clustering</b> and network optimization alternatively. Experimental results on several HSI datasets verify the advantages of the proposed method, e.g., on India Pines, our model improves the <b>clustering</b> accuracy from 58.79% to 67.59% compared to the SOTA method.

**ABSTRACT**  
Camouflage poses challenges in distinguishing a static target, whereas any movement of the target can break this disguise. Existing video camouflaged <b>object</b> <b>detection</b> (VCOD) approaches take noisy motion estimation as input or model motion implicitly, restricting detection performance in complex dynamic scenes. In this paper, we propose a novel Explicit Motion handling and Interactive <b>Prompting</b> <b>framework</b> for VCOD, dubbed EMIP, which handles motion cues explicitly using a frozen pre-trained optical flow fundamental model. EMIP is characterized by a two-stream architecture for simultaneously conducting camouflaged segmentation and optical flow estimation. Interactions across the dual streams are realized in an interactive <b>prompting</b> <b>way</b> that is inspired by emerging visual <b>prompt</b> <b>learning.</b> Two learnable modules, i.e. the camouflaged feeder and motion collector, are designed to incorporate segmentation-to-motion and motion-to-segmentation <b>prompts,</b> <b>respectively,</b> and enhance outputs of the both streams. The <b>prompt</b> <b>fed</b> to the motion stream is learned by supervising optical flow in a <b>self-supervised</b> manner. Furthermore, we show that long-term historical information can also be incorporated as a <b>prompt</b> <b>into</b> EMIP and achieve more robust results with temporal consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that our EMIP achieves new state-of-the-art records on popular VCOD <b>benchmarks.</b> The code will be publicly available.

**ABSTRACT**  
Modern computer <b>vision</b> <b>pipelines</b> handle large images in one of two sub-optimal ways: down-sampling or cropping. These two methods incur significant losses in the amount of information and context present in an image. There are many downstream applications in which global context matters as much as high frequency details, such as in real-world satellite imagery; in such cases researchers have to make the uncomfortable choice of which information to discard. We introduce xT, a simple framework for <b>vision</b> <b>transformers</b> which effectively aggregates global context with local details and can model large images end-to-end on contemporary GPUs. We select a set of <b>benchmark</b> datasets across classic <b>vision</b> <b>tasks</b> which accurately reflect a <b>vision</b> <b>model's</b> ability to understand truly large images and incorporate fine details over large scales and assess our method's improvement on them. By introducing a nested <b>tokenization</b> scheme for large images in conjunction with long-sequence length models normally used for natural language processing, we are able to increase accuracy by up to 8.6% on challenging classification tasks and $F_1$ score by 11.6 on context-dependent segmentation in large images.

**ABSTRACT**  
Large pre-trained <b>Vision-Language</b> Models (VLMs) like CLIP, despite having remarkable generalization ability, are highly vulnerable to <b>adversarial</b> <b>examples.</b> This work studies the <b>adversarial</b> <b>robustness</b> of VLMs from the novel perspective of the text <b>prompt</b> instead of the extensively studied model weights (frozen in this work). We first show that the effectiveness of both <b>adversarial</b> <b>attack</b> and defense are sensitive to the used text <b>prompt.</b> Inspired by this, we propose a method to improve resilience to <b>adversarial</b> <b>attacks</b> by learning a robust text <b>prompt</b> for VLMs. The proposed method, named <b>Adversarial</b> <b>Prompt</b> Tuning (APT), is effective while being both computationally and data efficient. Extensive experiments are conducted across 15 datasets and 4 data sparsity schemes (from 1-shot to full training data settings) to show APT's superiority over hand-engineered <b>prompts</b> and other state-of-the-art adaption methods. APT demonstrated excellent abilities in terms of the in-distribution performance and the generalization under input <b>distribution</b> <b>shift</b> and across datasets. Surprisingly, by simply adding one learned word to the <b>prompts,</b> APT can significantly boost the accuracy and robustness (epsilon=4/255) over the hand-engineered <b>prompts</b> by +13% and +8.5% on average respectively. The improvement further increases, in our most effective setting, to +26.4% for accuracy and +16.7% for robustness. Code is available at https://github.com/TreeLLi/APT.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper presents a Tri-branch Neural Fusion (TNF) approach designed for classifying <b>multimodal</b> medical images and tabular data. It also introduces two solutions to address the challenge of label inconsistency in <b>multimodal</b> classification. Traditional methods in multi-modality medical data classification often rely on single-label approaches, typically merging features from two distinct input modalities. This becomes problematic when features are mutually exclusive or labels differ across modalities, leading to reduced accuracy. To overcome this, our TNF approach implements a tri-branch framework that manages three separate outputs: one for image modality, another for tabular modality, and a third hybrid output that fuses both image and tabular data. The final decision is made through an ensemble method that integrates likelihoods from all three branches. We validate the effectiveness of TNF through extensive experiments, which illustrate its superiority over traditional fusion and ensemble methods in various <b>convolutional</b> <b>neural</b> <b>networks</b> and <b>transformer-based</b> architectures across multiple datasets.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Convolutional</b> <b>Neural</b> <b>Networks</b> <b>(CNNs)</b> have demonstrated outstanding performance in computer vision tasks such as image classification, detection, segmentation, and medical image analysis. In general, an arbitrary number of epochs is used to train such neural networks. In a single epoch, the entire training data -- divided by batch size -- are fed to the network. In practice, validation error with training loss is used to estimate the neural network's generalization, which indicates the optimal learning capacity of the network. Current practice is to stop training when the training loss decreases and the gap between training and validation error increases (i.e., the generalization gap) to avoid overfitting. However, this is a trial-and-error-based approach which raises a critical question: Is it possible to estimate when neural networks stop learning based on training data? This research work introduces a hypothesis that analyzes the data variation across all the layers of a <b>CNN</b> variant to anticipate its near-optimal learning capacity. In the training phase, we use our hypothesis to anticipate the near-optimal learning capacity of a <b>CNN</b> variant without using any validation data. Our hypothesis can be deployed as a plug-and-play to any existing <b>CNN</b> variant without introducing additional trainable parameters to the network. We test our hypothesis on six different <b>CNN</b> variants and three different general image datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and SVHN). The result based on these <b>CNN</b> variants and datasets shows that our hypothesis saves 58.49\% of computational time (on average) in training. We further conduct our hypothesis on ten medical image datasets and compared with the MedMNIST-V2 <b>benchmark.</b> Based on our experimental result, we save $\approx$ 44.1\% of computational time without losing accuracy against the MedMNIST-V2 <b>benchmark.</b>

**ABSTRACT**  
Existing Cross-Domain <b>Few-Shot</b> <b>Learning</b> (CDFSL) methods require access to source domain data to train a model in the pre-training phase. However, due to increasing concerns about data privacy and the desire to reduce data transmission and training costs, it is necessary to develop a CDFSL solution without accessing source data. For this reason, this paper explores a Source-Free CDFSL (SF-CDFSL) problem, in which CDFSL is addressed through the use of existing pretrained models instead of training a model with source data, avoiding accessing source data. This paper proposes an Enhanced Information Maximization with Distance-Aware <b>Contrastive</b> <b>Learning</b> (IM-DCL) method to address these challenges. Firstly, we introduce the transductive mechanism for learning the query set. Secondly, information maximization (IM) is explored to map target samples into both individual certainty and global diversity predictions, helping the source model better fit the target data distribution. However, IM fails to learn the decision boundary of the target task. This motivates us to introduce a novel approach called Distance-Aware <b>Contrastive</b> <b>Learning</b> (DCL), in which we consider the entire feature set as both positive and negative sets, akin to Schrodinger's concept of a dual state. Instead of a rigid separation between positive and negative sets, we employ a weighted distance calculation among features to establish a soft classification of the positive and negative sets for the entire feature set. Furthermore, we address issues related to IM by incorporating <b>contrastive</b> <b>constraints</b> between object features and their corresponding positive and negative sets. Evaluations of the 4 datasets in the BSCD-FSL <b>benchmark</b> indicate that the proposed IM-DCL, without accessing the source domain, demonstrates superiority over existing methods, especially in the distant domain task.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recent human-object interaction (HOI) detection approaches rely on high cost of manpower and require comprehensive annotated image datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel <b>self-adaption</b> language-driven HOI detection method, termed as FreeA, without labeling by leveraging the adaptability of CLIP to generate latent HOI labels. To be specific, FreeA matches image features of human-object pairs with HOI text templates, and a priori knowledge-based mask method is developed to suppress improbable interactions. In addition, FreeA utilizes the proposed interaction correlation matching method to enhance the likelihood of actions related to a specified action, further refine the generated HOI labels. Experiments on two <b>benchmark</b> datasets show that FreeA achieves state-of-the-art performance among weakly <b>supervised</b> HOI models. Our approach is +8.58 mean Average Precision (mAP) on HICO-DET and +1.23 mAP on V-COCO more accurate in localizing and classifying the interactive actions than the newest weakly model, and +1.68 mAP and +7.28 mAP than the latest weakly+ model, respectively. Code will be available at https://drliuqi.github.io/.

**ABSTRACT**  
Video <b>Diffusion</b> <b>Models</b> have been developed for video generation, usually integrating text and image conditioning to enhance control over the generated content. Despite the progress, ensuring consistency across frames remains a challenge, particularly when using text <b>prompts</b> as control conditions. To address this problem, we introduce UniCtrl, a novel, plug-and-play method that is universally applicable to improve the spatiotemporal consistency and motion diversity of videos generated by text-to-video models without additional training. UniCtrl ensures semantic consistency across different frames through cross-frame <b>self-attention</b> control, and meanwhile, enhances the motion quality and spatiotemporal consistency through motion injection and spatiotemporal synchronization. Our experimental results demonstrate UniCtrl's efficacy in enhancing various text-to-video models, confirming its effectiveness and universality.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Transformers</b> have revolutionized computer <b>vision</b> <b>and</b> natural language processing, but their high computational complexity limits their application in high-resolution image processing and long-context analysis. This paper introduces <b>Vision-RWKV</b> <b>(VRWKV),</b> a model adapted from the RWKV model used in the NLP field with necessary modifications for <b>vision</b> <b>tasks.</b> Similar to the <b>Vision</b> <b>Transformer</b> (ViT), our model is designed to efficiently handle sparse inputs and demonstrate robust global processing capabilities, while also scaling up effectively, accommodating both large-scale parameters and extensive datasets. Its distinctive advantage lies in its reduced spatial aggregation complexity, which renders it exceptionally adept at processing high-resolution images seamlessly, eliminating the necessity for windowing operations. Our evaluations demonstrate that VRWKV surpasses ViT's performance in image classification and has significantly faster speeds and lower memory usage processing high-resolution inputs. In dense prediction tasks, it outperforms window-based models, maintaining comparable speeds. These results highlight VRWKV's potential as a more efficient alternative for visual perception tasks. Code is released at \url{https://github.com/OpenGVLab/Vision-RWKV}.

**ABSTRACT**  
We present a two-stage text-to-3D generation system, namely 3DTopia, which generates high-quality general 3D assets within 5 minutes using hybrid <b>diffusion</b> <b>priors.</b> The first stage samples from a 3D <b>diffusion</b> <b>prior</b> directly learned from 3D data. Specifically, it is powered by a text-conditioned tri-plane latent <b>diffusion</b> <b>model,</b> which quickly generates coarse 3D samples for fast prototyping. The second stage utilizes 2D <b>diffusion</b> <b>priors</b> to further refine the texture of coarse 3D models from the first stage. The refinement consists of both latent and pixel space optimization for high-quality texture generation. To facilitate the training of the proposed system, we clean and caption the largest open-source 3D dataset, Objaverse, by combining the power of vision language models and <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models.</b> Experiment results are reported qualitatively and quantitatively to show the performance of the proposed system.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recently, infrared small target detection (ISTD) has made significant progress, thanks to the development of basic models. Specifically, the structures combining <b>convolutional</b> <b>networks</b> with <b>transformers</b> can successfully extract both local and global features. However, the disadvantage of the <b>transformer</b> is also inherited, i.e., the quadratic computational complexity to the length of the sequence. Inspired by the recent basic model with linear complexity for long-distance modeling, called Mamba, we explore the potential of this state space model for ISTD task in terms of effectiveness and efficiency in the paper. However, directly applying Mamba achieves poor performance since local features, which are critical to detecting small targets, cannot be fully exploited. Instead, we tailor a Mamba-in-Mamba (MiM-ISTD) structure for efficient ISTD. Specifically, we treat the local patches as "visual sentences" and use the Outer Mamba to explore the global information. We then decompose each visual sentence into sub-patches as "visual words" and use the Inner Mamba to further explore the local information among words in the visual sentence with negligible computational costs. By aggregating the word and sentence features, the MiM-ISTD can effectively explore both global and local information. Experiments on NUAA-SIRST and IRSTD-1k show the superior accuracy and efficiency of our method. Specifically, MiM-ISTD is $10 \times$ faster than the SOTA method and reduces GPU memory usage by 73.4$\%$ when testing on $2048 \times 2048$ image, overcoming the computation and memory constraints on high-resolution infrared images.

**ABSTRACT**  
Fine classification of city-scale buildings from satellite remote sensing imagery is a crucial research area with significant implications for urban planning, infrastructure development, and population distribution analysis. However, the task faces big challenges due to low-resolution overhead images acquired from high altitude space-borne platforms and the long-tail sample distribution of fine-grained urban building categories, leading to severe class imbalance problem. To address these issues, we propose a deep network approach to fine-grained classification of urban buildings using open-access satellite images. A Denoising Diffusion <b>Probabilistic</b> <b>Model</b> (DDPM) based super-resolution method is first introduced to enhance the spatial resolution of satellite images, which benefits from domain-adaptive <b>knowledge</b> <b>distillation.</b> Then, a new fine-grained classification network with Category Information Balancing Module (CIBM) and Contrastive Supervision (CS) technique is proposed to mitigate the problem of class imbalance and improve the classification robustness and accuracy. Experiments on Hong Kong data set with 11 fine building types revealed promising classification results with a mean Top-1 accuracy of 60.45\%, which is on par with street-view image based approaches. Extensive ablation study shows that CIBM and CS improve Top-1 accuracy by 2.6\% and 3.5\% compared to the baseline method, respectively. And both modules can be easily inserted into other classification networks and similar enhancements have been achieved. Our research contributes to the field of urban analysis by providing a practical solution for fine classification of buildings in challenging mega city scenarios solely using open-access satellite images. The proposed method can serve as a valuable tool for urban planners, aiding in the understanding of economic, industrial, and population distribution.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recent advancement in <b>text-to-image</b> models (e.g., Stable <b>Diffusion)</b> <b>and</b> corresponding personalized technologies (e.g., DreamBooth and LoRA) enables individuals to generate high-quality and imaginative images. However, they often suffer from limitations when generating images with resolutions outside of their trained domain. To overcome this limitation, we present the Resolution Adapter (ResAdapter), a domain-consistent adapter designed for <b>diffusion</b> <b>models</b> to generate images with unrestricted resolutions and aspect ratios. Unlike other multi-resolution generation methods that process images of static resolution with complex post-process operations, ResAdapter directly generates images with the dynamical resolution. Especially, after learning a deep understanding of pure resolution priors, ResAdapter trained on the general dataset, generates resolution-free images with personalized <b>diffusion</b> <b>models</b> while preserving their original style domain. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ResAdapter with only 0.5M can process images with flexible resolutions for arbitrary <b>diffusion</b> <b>models.</b> More extended experiments demonstrate that ResAdapter is compatible with other modules (e.g., <b>ControlNet,</b> IP-Adapter and LCM-LoRA) for image generation across a broad range of resolutions, and can be integrated into other multi-resolution model (e.g., ElasticDiffusion) for efficiently generating higher-resolution images.

**ABSTRACT**  
Detecting surface anomalies of industrial materials poses a significant challenge within a myriad of industrial manufacturing processes. In recent times, various methodologies have emerged, capitalizing on the advantages of employing a network pre-trained on natural images for the extraction of representative features. Subsequently, these features are subjected to processing through a diverse range of techniques including memory banks, normalizing flow, and <b>knowledge</b> <b>distillation,</b> which have exhibited exceptional accuracy. This paper revisits approaches based on pre-trained features by introducing a novel method centered on target-specific embedding. To capture the most representative features of the texture under consideration, we employ a variant of a contrastive training procedure that incorporates both artificially generated defective samples and <b>anomaly-free</b> <b>samples</b> during training. Exploiting the intrinsic properties of surfaces, we derived a meaningful representation from the defect-free samples during training, facilitating a straightforward yet effective calculation of <b>anomaly</b> <b>scores.</b> The experiments conducted on the MVTEC AD and TILDA datasets demonstrate the competitiveness of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods.

**ABSTRACT**  
3D asset generation is getting massive amounts of attention, inspired by the recent success of text-guided 2D content creation. Existing text-to-3D methods use pretrained <b>text-to-image</b> <b>diffusion</b> <b>models</b> in an optimization problem or <b>fine-tune</b> them on synthetic data, which often results in non-photorealistic 3D objects without backgrounds. In this paper, we present a method that leverages pretrained <b>text-to-image</b> models as a prior, and learn to generate multi-view images in a single denoising process from real-world data. Concretely, we propose to integrate 3D volume-rendering and cross-frame-attention layers into each block of the existing U-Net network of the <b>text-to-image</b> model. Moreover, we design an autoregressive generation that renders more 3D-consistent images at any viewpoint. We train our model on real-world datasets of objects and showcase its capabilities to generate instances with a variety of high-quality shapes and textures in authentic surroundings. Compared to the existing methods, the results generated by our method are consistent, and have favorable visual quality (-30% FID, -37% KID).

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Text-to-image</b> generative models can generate high-quality humans, but realism is lost when generating hands. Common artifacts include irregular hand poses, shapes, incorrect numbers of fingers, and physically implausible finger orientations. To generate images with realistic hands, we propose a novel <b>diffusion-based</b> <b>architecture</b> called HanDiffuser that achieves realism by injecting hand embeddings in the generative process. HanDiffuser consists of two components: a Text-to-Hand-Params <b>diffusion</b> <b>model</b> to generate SMPL-Body and MANO-Hand parameters from input text <b>prompts,</b> and a Text-Guided Hand-Params-to-Image <b>diffusion</b> <b>model</b> to synthesize images by conditioning on the <b>prompts</b> and hand parameters generated by the previous component. We incorporate multiple aspects of hand representation, including 3D shapes and joint-level finger positions, orientations and articulations, for robust learning and reliable performance during inference. We conduct extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments and perform user studies to demonstrate the efficacy of our method in generating images with high-quality hands.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper presents Incremental <b>Vision-Language</b> <b>Object</b> <b>Detection</b> (IVLOD), a novel learning task designed to incrementally adapt pre-trained <b>Vision-Language</b> <b>Object</b> <b>Detection</b> Models (VLODMs) to various specialized domains, while simultaneously preserving their <b>zero-shot</b> generalization capabilities for the generalized domain. To address this new challenge, we present the Zero-interference Reparameterizable Adaptation (ZiRa), a novel method that introduces Zero-interference Loss and reparameterization techniques to tackle IVLOD without incurring additional inference costs or a significant increase in memory usage. Comprehensive experiments on COCO and ODinW-13 datasets demonstrate that ZiRa effectively safeguards the <b>zero-shot</b> generalization ability of VLODMs while continuously adapting to new tasks. Specifically, after training on ODinW-13 datasets, ZiRa exhibits superior performance compared to CL-DETR and iDETR, boosting <b>zero-shot</b> generalizability by substantial 13.91 and 8.71 AP, respectively.

**ABSTRACT**  
Understanding social interactions involving both verbal and non-verbal cues is essential to effectively interpret social situations. However, most prior works on <b>multimodal</b> social cues focus predominantly on single-person behaviors or rely on holistic visual representations that are not densely aligned to utterances in multi-party environments. They are limited in modeling the intricate dynamics of multi-party interactions. In this paper, we introduce three new challenging tasks to model the fine-grained dynamics between multiple people: speaking target identification, pronoun <b>coreference</b> <b>resolution,</b> and mentioned player prediction. We contribute extensive data annotations to curate these new challenges in social deduction game settings. Furthermore, we propose a novel <b>multimodal</b> baseline that leverages densely aligned language-visual representations by synchronizing visual features with their corresponding utterances. This facilitates concurrently capturing verbal and non-verbal cues pertinent to social <b>reasoning.</b> Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach with densely aligned <b>multimodal</b> representations in modeling social interactions. We will release our <b>benchmarks</b> and source code to facilitate further research.

**ABSTRACT**  
This dissertation is a multifaceted contribution to the advancement of vision-based 3D perception technologies. In the first segment, the thesis introduces structural enhancements to both monocular and stereo 3D <b>object</b> <b>detection</b> algorithms. By integrating ground-referenced geometric priors into monocular detection models, this research achieves unparalleled accuracy in <b>benchmark</b> evaluations for monocular 3D detection. Concurrently, the work refines stereo 3D detection paradigms by incorporating insights and inferential structures gleaned from monocular networks, thereby augmenting the operational efficiency of stereo detection systems. The second segment is devoted to data-driven strategies and their real-world applications in 3D vision detection. A novel training regimen is introduced that amalgamates datasets annotated with either 2D or 3D labels. This approach not only augments the detection models through the utilization of a substantially expanded dataset but also facilitates economical model deployment in real-world scenarios where only 2D annotations are readily available. Lastly, the dissertation presents an innovative pipeline tailored for <b>unsupervised</b> depth estimation in autonomous driving contexts. Extensive empirical analyses affirm the robustness and efficacy of this newly proposed pipeline. Collectively, these contributions lay a robust foundation for the widespread adoption of vision-based 3D perception technologies in autonomous driving applications.

**ABSTRACT**  
Differentially private (DP) machine learning is considered the gold-standard solution for training a model from sensitive data while still preserving privacy. However, a major barrier to achieving this ideal is its sub-optimal privacy-accuracy trade-off, which is particularly visible in DP <b>representation</b> <b>learning.</b> Specifically, it has been shown that under modest privacy budgets, most models learn <b>representations</b> <b>that</b> are not significantly better than hand-crafted features. In this work, we show that effective DP <b>representation</b> <b>learning</b> can be done via image captioning and scaling up to internet-scale <b>multimodal</b> datasets. Through a series of engineering tricks, we successfully train a DP image captioner (DP-Cap) on a 233M subset of LAION-2B from scratch using a reasonable amount of computation, and obtaining unprecedented high-quality image features that can be used in a variety of downstream vision and <b>vision-language</b> tasks. For example, under a privacy budget of $\varepsilon=8$, a linear classifier trained on top of learned DP-Cap features attains 65.8% accuracy on ImageNet-1K, considerably improving the previous SOTA of 56.5%. Our work challenges the prevailing sentiment that high-utility DP <b>representation</b> <b>learning</b> cannot be achieved by training from scratch.

Creating 3D textured meshes using generative artificial intelligence has garnered significant attention recently. While existing methods support text-based generative texture generation or editing on 3D meshes, they often struggle to precisely control pixels of texture images through more intuitive interaction. While 2D images can be edited generatively using drag interaction, applying this type of methods directly to 3D mesh textures still leads to issues such as the lack of local consistency among multiple views, error accumulation and long training times. To address these challenges, we propose a generative point-based 3D mesh texture editing method called DragTex. This method utilizes a <b>diffusion</b> <b>model</b> to blend locally inconsistent textures in the region near the deformed silhouette between different views, enabling locally consistent texture editing. Besides, we <b>fine-tune</b> a decoder to reduce reconstruction errors in the non-drag region, thereby mitigating overall error accumulation. Moreover, we train LoRA using multi-view images instead of training each view individually, which significantly shortens the training time. The experimental results show that our method effectively achieves dragging textures on 3D meshes and generates plausible textures that align with the desired intent of drag interaction.

**ABSTRACT**  
Image retrieval enables an efficient search through vast amounts of satellite imagery and returns similar images to a query. Deep learning models can identify images across various semantic concepts without the need for annotations. This work proposes to use Geospatial <b>Foundation</b> <b>Models,</b> like Prithvi, for remote sensing image retrieval with multiple benefits: i) the models encode multi-spectral satellite data and ii) generalize without further <b>fine-tuning.</b> We introduce two datasets to the retrieval task and observe a strong performance: Prithvi processes six bands and achieves a mean Average Precision of 97.62\% on BigEarthNet-43 and 44.51\% on ForestNet-12, outperforming other RGB-based models. Further, we evaluate three compression methods with binarized embeddings balancing retrieval speed and accuracy. They match the retrieval speed of much shorter hash codes while maintaining the same accuracy as floating-point embeddings but with a 32-fold compression. The code is available at https://github.com/IBM/remote-sensing-image-retrieval.

**ABSTRACT**  
Three-dimensional Digital Subtraction Angiography (3D-DSA) is a well-established X-ray-based technique for visualizing vascular anatomy. Recently, four-dimensional DSA (4D-DSA) reconstruction algorithms have been developed to enable the visualization of volumetric contrast flow dynamics through time-series of volumes. . This reconstruction problem is ill-posed mainly due to vessel overlap in the projection direction and geometric vessel foreshortening, which leads to information loss in the recorded projection images. However, knowledge about the underlying fluid dynamics can be leveraged to constrain the solution space. In our work, we implicitly include this information in a neural network-based model that is trained on a dataset of image-based blood flow <b>simulations.</b> The model predicts the spatially averaged contrast agent concentration for each centerline point of the vasculature over time, lowering the overall computational demand. The trained network enables the reconstruction of relative contrast agent concentrations with a mean absolute error of 0.02 $\pm$ 0.02 and a mean absolute percentage error of 5.31 % $\pm$ 9.25 %. Moreover, the network is robust to varying degrees of vessel overlap and vessel foreshortening. Our approach demonstrates the potential of the integration of machine learning and blood flow <b>simulations</b> in time-resolved angiographic flow reconstruction.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recent advancements in large-scale pre-trained <b>text-to-image</b> models have led to remarkable progress in semantic image synthesis. Nevertheless, synthesizing high-quality images with consistent semantics and layout remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose the adaPtive LAyout-semantiC fusion modulE (PLACE) that harnesses pre-trained models to alleviate the aforementioned issues. Specifically, we first employ the layout control map to faithfully represent layouts in the feature space. Subsequently, we combine the layout and semantic features in a timestep-adaptive manner to synthesize images with realistic details. During <b>fine-tuning,</b> we propose the Semantic Alignment (SA) loss to further enhance layout alignment. Additionally, we introduce the Layout-Free Prior Preservation (LFP) loss, which leverages unlabeled data to maintain the priors of pre-trained models, thereby improving the visual quality and semantic consistency of synthesized images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach performs favorably in terms of visual quality, semantic consistency, and layout alignment. The source code and model are available at https://github.com/cszy98/PLACE/tree/main.

**ABSTRACT**  
Three-dimensional point cloud <b>anomaly</b> <b>detection</b> that aims to detect <b>anomaly</b> <b>data</b> points from a training set serves as the foundation for a variety of applications, including industrial inspection and autonomous driving. However, existing point cloud <b>anomaly</b> <b>detection</b> methods often incorporate multiple feature memory banks to fully preserve local and global representations, which comes at the high cost of computational complexity and mismatches between features. To address that, we propose an <b>unsupervised</b> point cloud <b>anomaly</b> <b>detection</b> framework based on joint local-global features, termed PointCore. To be specific, PointCore only requires a single memory bank to store local (coordinate) and global (PointMAE) representations and different priorities are assigned to these local-global features, thereby reducing the computational cost and mismatching disturbance in inference. Furthermore, to robust against the outliers, a normalization ranking method is introduced to not only adjust values of different scales to a notionally common scale, but also transform densely-distributed data into a uniform distribution. Extensive experiments on Real3D-AD dataset demonstrate that PointCore achieves competitive inference time and the best performance in both detection and localization as compared to the state-of-the-art Reg3D-AD approach and several competitors.

**ABSTRACT**  
We present OOTDiffusion, a novel network architecture for realistic and controllable image-based virtual try-on (VTON). We leverage the power of pretrained latent <b>diffusion</b> <b>models,</b> designing an outfitting UNet to learn the garment detail features. Without a redundant warping process, the garment features are precisely aligned with the target human body via the proposed outfitting fusion in the <b>self-attention</b> layers of the denoising UNet. In order to further enhance the controllability, we introduce outfitting dropout to the training process, which enables us to adjust the strength of the garment features through classifier-free guidance. Our comprehensive experiments on the VITON-HD and Dress Code datasets demonstrate that OOTDiffusion efficiently generates high-quality try-on results for arbitrary human and garment images, which outperforms other VTON methods in both realism and controllability, indicating an impressive breakthrough in virtual try-on. Our source code is available at https://github.com/levihsu/OOTDiffusion.

**ABSTRACT**  
Channel attention mechanisms endeavor to recalibrate channel weights to enhance representation abilities of networks. However, mainstream methods often rely solely on global average pooling as the feature squeezer, which significantly limits the overall potential of models. In this paper, we investigate the statistical moments of feature maps within a neural network. Our findings highlight the critical role of high-order moments in enhancing model capacity. Consequently, we introduce a flexible and comprehensive mechanism termed Extensive Moment Aggregation (EMA) to capture the global spatial context. Building upon this mechanism, we propose the Moment Channel Attention (MCA) framework, which efficiently incorporates multiple levels of moment-based information while minimizing additional computation costs through our Cross Moment <b>Convolution</b> (CMC) module. The CMC module via channel-wise <b>convolution</b> layer to capture multiple order moment information as well as cross channel features. The MCA block is designed to be lightweight and easily integrated into a variety of neural network architectures. Experimental results on classical image classification, <b>object</b> <b>detection,</b> and instance segmentation tasks demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results, outperforming existing channel attention methods.

**ABSTRACT**  
Smiles and laughs detection systems have attracted a lot of attention in the past decade contributing to the improvement of human-agent interaction systems. But very few considered these expressions as distinct, although no prior work clearly proves them to belong to the same category or not. In this work, we present a deep learning-based <b>multimodal</b> smile and laugh classification system, considering them as two different entities. We compare the use of audio and vision-based models as well as a fusion approach. We show that, as expected, the fusion leads to a better generalization on unseen data. We also present an in-depth analysis of the behavior of these models on the smiles and laughs intensity levels. The analyses on the intensity levels show that the relationship between smiles and laughs might not be as simple as a binary one or even grouping them in a single category, and so, a more complex approach should be taken when dealing with them. We also tackle the problem of limited resources by showing that <b>transfer</b> <b>learning</b> allows the models to improve the detection of confusing intensity levels.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this paper, we abstract the process of people hearing speech, extracting meaningful cues, and creating various dynamically audio-consistent talking faces, termed Listening and Imagining, into the task of high-fidelity diverse talking faces generation from a single audio. Specifically, it involves two critical challenges: one is to effectively decouple identity, content, and emotion from entangled audio, and the other is to maintain intra-video diversity and inter-video consistency. To tackle the issues, we first dig out the intricate relationships among facial factors and simplify the decoupling process, tailoring a Progressive Audio Disentanglement for accurate facial <b>geometry</b> and semantics learning, where each stage incorporates a customized training module responsible for a specific factor. Secondly, to achieve visually diverse and audio-synchronized animation solely from input audio within a single model, we introduce the Controllable Coherent Frame generation, which involves the flexible integration of three trainable adapters with frozen Latent <b>Diffusion</b> <b>Models</b> (LDMs) to focus on maintaining facial <b>geometry</b> and semantics, as well as texture and temporal coherence between frames. In this way, we inherit high-quality diverse generation from LDMs while significantly improving their controllability at a low training cost. Extensive experiments demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of our method in handling this paradigm. The codes will be released at https://github.com/modelscope/facechain.

**ABSTRACT**  
Combining images from multi-modalities is beneficial to explore various information in computer vision, especially in the medical domain. As an essential part of clinical diagnosis, <b>multi-modal</b> brain tumor segmentation aims to delineate the malignant entity involving multiple modalities. Although existing methods have shown remarkable performance in the task, the information exchange for cross-scale and high-level representations fusion in spatial and modality are limited in these methods. In this paper, we present a novel Modality Aware and Shift Mixer that integrates intra-modality and inter-modality dependencies of <b>multi-modal</b> images for effective and robust brain tumor segmentation. Specifically, we introduce a Modality-Aware module according to neuroimaging studies for modeling the specific modality pair relationships at low levels, and a Modality-Shift module with specific mosaic patterns is developed to explore the complex relationships across modalities at high levels via the <b>self-attention.</b> Experimentally, we outperform previous state-of-the-art approaches on the public Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS 2021 segmentation) dataset. Further qualitative experiments demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of MASM.

**ABSTRACT**  
Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSSS) has been proposed to alleviate the burden of time-consuming pixel-level manual labeling, which leverages limited labeled data along with larger amounts of unlabeled data. Current state-of-the-art methods train the labeled data with ground truths and unlabeled data with pseudo labels. However, the two training flows are separate, which allows labeled data to dominate the training process, resulting in low-quality pseudo labels and, consequently, sub-optimal results. To alleviate this issue, we present AllSpark, which reborns the labeled features from unlabeled ones with the channel-wise cross-attention mechanism. We further introduce a Semantic Memory along with a Channel Semantic Grouping strategy to ensure that unlabeled features adequately represent labeled features. The AllSpark shed new light on the architecture level designs of SSSS rather than framework level, which avoids increasingly complicated training pipeline designs. It can also be regarded as a flexible bottleneck module that can be seamlessly integrated into a general <b>transformer-based</b> segmentation model. The proposed AllSpark outperforms existing methods across all evaluation protocols on Pascal, Cityscapes and COCO <b>benchmarks</b> without bells-and-whistles. Code and model weights are available at: https://github.com/xmed-lab/AllSpark.

**ABSTRACT**  
Deepfake technology has given rise to a spectrum of novel and compelling applications. Unfortunately, the widespread proliferation of high-fidelity fake videos has led to pervasive confusion and deception, shattering our faith that seeing is believing. One aspect that has been overlooked so far is that current deepfake detection approaches may easily fall into the trap of overfitting, focusing only on forgery clues within one or a few local regions. Moreover, existing works heavily rely on neural networks to extract forgery features, lacking theoretical constraints guaranteeing that sufficient forgery clues are extracted and superfluous features are eliminated. These deficiencies culminate in unsatisfactory accuracy and limited generalizability in real-life scenarios. In this paper, we try to tackle these challenges through three designs: (1) We present a novel framework to capture broader forgery clues by extracting multiple non-overlapping local representations and fusing them into a global semantic-rich feature. (2) Based on the information bottleneck theory, we derive Local Information Loss to guarantee the orthogonality of local representations while preserving comprehensive task-relevant information. (3) Further, to fuse the local representations and remove task-irrelevant information, we arrive at a Global Information Loss through the theoretical analysis of <b>mutual</b> <b>information.</b> Empirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on five <b>benchmark</b> datasets.Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/QingyuLiu/Exposing-the-Deception}, hoping to inspire researchers.

**ABSTRACT**  
High dynamic range (HDR) imaging involves capturing a series of frames of the same scene, each with different exposure settings, to broaden the dynamic range of light. This can be achieved through burst capturing or using staggered HDR sensors that capture long and short exposures simultaneously in the camera image signal processor (ISP). Within camera ISP pipeline, illuminant estimation is a crucial step aiming to estimate the color of the global illuminant in the scene. This estimation is used in camera ISP white-balance module to remove undesirable color cast in the final image. Despite the multiple frames captured in the HDR pipeline, conventional illuminant estimation methods often rely only on a single frame of the scene. In this paper, we explore leveraging information from frames captured with different exposure times. Specifically, we introduce a simple feature extracted from dual-exposure images to guide illuminant estimators, referred to as the dual-exposure feature (DEF). To validate the efficiency of DEF, we employed two illuminant estimators using the proposed DEF: 1) a multilayer perceptron network (MLP), referred to as exposure-based MLP (EMLP), and 2) a modified version of the <b>convolutional</b> color constancy (CCC) to integrate our DEF, that we call ECCC. Both EMLP and ECCC achieve promising results, in some cases surpassing prior methods that require hundreds of thousands or millions of parameters, with only a few hundred parameters for EMLP and a few thousand parameters for ECCC.

**ABSTRACT**  
In the highly competitive area of product marketing, the visibility of brand logos on packaging plays a crucial role in shaping consumer perception, directly influencing the success of the product. This paper introduces a comprehensive framework to measure the brand logo's attention on a packaging design. The proposed method consists of three steps. The first step leverages YOLOv8 for precise logo detection across prominent datasets, FoodLogoDet-1500 and LogoDet-3K. The second step involves modeling the user's visual attention with a novel saliency prediction model tailored for the packaging context. The proposed saliency model combines the visual elements with text maps employing a <b>transformers-based</b> architecture to predict user attention maps. In the third step, by integrating logo detection with a saliency map generation, the framework provides a comprehensive brand attention score. The effectiveness of the proposed method is assessed module by module, ensuring a thorough evaluation of each component. Comparing logo detection and saliency map prediction with state-of-the-art models shows the superiority of the proposed methods. To investigate the robustness of the proposed brand attention score, we collected a unique dataset to examine previous psychophysical hypotheses related to brand visibility. the results show that the brand attention score is in line with all previous studies. Also, we introduced seven new hypotheses to check the impact of position, orientation, presence of person, and other visual elements on brand attention. This research marks a significant stride in the intersection of cognitive psychology, computer vision, and marketing, paving the way for advanced, consumer-centric packaging designs.

**ABSTRACT**  
Sequence-to-sequence <b>vision-language</b> models are showing promise, but their applicability is limited by their inference latency due to their autoregressive way of generating predictions. We propose a parallel decoding sequence-to-sequence <b>vision-language</b> model, trained with a Query-CTC loss, that marginalizes over multiple inference paths in the decoder. This allows us to model the joint distribution of tokens, rather than restricting to conditional distribution as in an autoregressive model. The resulting model, NARVL, achieves performance on-par with its state-of-the-art autoregressive counterpart, but is faster at inference time, reducing from the linear complexity associated with the sequential generation of tokens to a paradigm of constant time joint inference.

**ABSTRACT**  
In Multiple Object Tracking, objects often exhibit non-linear motion of acceleration and deceleration, with irregular direction changes. Tacking-by-detection (TBD) with Kalman Filter motion prediction works well in pedestrian-dominant scenarios but falls short in complex situations when multiple objects perform non-linear and diverse motion simultaneously. To tackle the complex non-linear motion, we propose a real-time diffusion-based MOT approach named DiffMOT. Specifically, for the motion predictor component, we propose a novel Decoupled Diffusion-based Motion Predictor (D MP). It models the entire distribution of various motion presented by the data as a whole. It also predicts an individual object's motion conditioning on an individual's historical motion information. Furthermore, it optimizes the diffusion process with much less sampling steps. As a MOT tracker, the DiffMOT is real-time at 22.7FPS, and also outperforms the state-of-the-art on DanceTrack and SportsMOT datasets with 63.4 and 76.2 in HOTA metrics, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, DiffMOT is the first to introduce a diffusion <b>probabilistic</b> <b>model</b> into the MOT to tackle non-linear motion prediction.

**ABSTRACT**  
Novel-view synthesis with sparse input views is important for real-world applications like AR/VR and autonomous driving. Recent methods have integrated depth information into NeRFs for sparse input synthesis, leveraging depth prior for geometric and spatial understanding. However, most existing works tend to overlook inaccuracies within depth maps and have low time efficiency. To address these issues, we propose a depth-guided robust and fast point cloud fusion NeRF for sparse inputs. We perceive radiance fields as an explicit voxel grid of features. A point cloud is constructed for each input view, characterized within the voxel grid using matrices and vectors. We accumulate the point cloud of each input view to construct the fused point cloud of the entire scene. Each voxel determines its density and appearance by referring to the point cloud of the entire scene. Through point cloud fusion and voxel grid <b>fine-tuning,</b> inaccuracies in depth values are refined or substituted by those from other views. Moreover, our method can achieve faster reconstruction and greater compactness through effective vector-matrix decomposition. Experimental results underline the superior performance and time efficiency of our approach compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

**ABSTRACT**  
3D <b>object</b> <b>detection</b> based on LiDAR point cloud and prior anchor boxes is a critical technology for autonomous driving environment perception and understanding. Nevertheless, an overlooked practical issue in existing methods is the ambiguity in training sample allocation based on box Intersection over Union (IoU_box). This problem impedes further enhancements in the performance of anchor-based LiDAR 3D <b>object</b> <b>detectors.</b> To tackle this challenge, this paper introduces a new training sample selection method that utilizes point cloud distribution for anchor sample quality measurement, named Point Assisted Sample Selection (PASS). This method has undergone rigorous evaluation on two widely utilized datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the application of PASS elevates the average precision of anchor-based LiDAR 3D <b>object</b> <b>detectors</b> to a novel state-of-the-art, thereby proving the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The codes will be made available at https://github.com/XJTU-Haolin/Point_Assisted_Sample_Selection.

**ABSTRACT**  
Computer vision models normally witness degraded performance when deployed in real-world scenarios, due to unexpected changes in inputs that were not accounted for during training. <b>Data</b> <b>augmentation</b> is commonly used to address this issue, as it aims to increase <b>data</b> <b>variety</b> and reduce the distribution gap between training and test <b>data.</b> <b>However,</b> common visual augmentations might not guarantee extensive robustness of computer vision models. In this paper, we propose Auxiliary Fourier-basis Augmentation (AFA), a complementary technique targeting augmentation in the frequency domain and filling the augmentation gap left by visual augmentations. We demonstrate the utility of augmentation via Fourier-basis additive noise in a straightforward and efficient adversarial setting. Our results show that AFA benefits the robustness of models against common corruptions, OOD generalization, and consistency of performance of models against increasing perturbations, with negligible deficit to the standard performance of models. It can be seamlessly integrated with other augmentation techniques to further boost performance. Code and models can be found at: https://github.com/nis-research/afa-augment

**ABSTRACT**  
Semantic segmentation is an important and popular research area in computer vision that focuses on classifying pixels in an image based on their semantics. However, <b>supervised</b> deep learning requires large amounts of data to train models and the process of labeling images pixel by pixel is time-consuming and laborious. This review aims to provide a first comprehensive and organized overview of the state-of-the-art research results on pseudo-label methods in the field of semi-supervised semantic segmentation, which we categorize from different perspectives and present specific methods for specific application areas. In addition, we explore the application of pseudo-label technology in medical and remote-sensing image segmentation. Finally, we also propose some feasible future research directions to address the existing challenges.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recently, video generation has achieved significant rapid development based on superior <b>text-to-image</b> generation techniques. In this work, we propose a high fidelity framework for image-to-video generation, named AtomoVideo. Based on multi-granularity image injection, we achieve higher fidelity of the generated video to the given image. In addition, thanks to high quality datasets and training strategies, we achieve greater motion intensity while maintaining superior temporal consistency and stability. Our architecture extends flexibly to the video frame prediction task, enabling long sequence prediction through iterative generation. Furthermore, due to the design of adapter training, our approach can be well combined with existing personalized models and controllable modules. By quantitatively and qualitatively evaluation, AtomoVideo achieves superior results compared to popular methods, more examples can be found on our project website: https://atomo-video.github.io/.

**ABSTRACT**  
In the realm of computer vision and graphics, accurately establishing correspondences between geometric 3D shapes is pivotal for applications like object tracking, registration, texture transfer, and statistical shape analysis. Moving beyond traditional hand-crafted and data-driven feature learning methods, we incorporate spectral methods with deep learning, focusing on functional maps (FMs) and optimal transport (OT). Traditional OT-based approaches, often reliant on entropy regularization OT in learning-based framework, face computational challenges due to their quadratic cost. Our key contribution is to employ the sliced Wasserstein distance (SWD) for OT, which is a valid fast optimal transport metric in an <b>unsupervised</b> shape matching framework. This <b>unsupervised</b> framework integrates functional map regularizers with a novel OT-based loss derived from SWD, enhancing feature alignment between shapes treated as discrete probability measures. We also introduce an adaptive refinement process utilizing entropy regularized OT, further refining feature alignments for accurate point-to-point correspondences. Our method demonstrates superior performance in non-rigid shape matching, including near-isometric and non-isometric scenarios, and excels in downstream tasks like segmentation transfer. The empirical results on diverse datasets highlight our framework's effectiveness and generalization capabilities, setting new standards in non-rigid shape matching with efficient OT metrics and an adaptive refinement module.

Handwritten mathematical expression recognition (HMER) is challenging in <b>image-to-text</b> tasks due to the complex layouts of mathematical expressions and suffers from problems including over-parsing and under-parsing. To solve these, previous HMER methods improve the attention mechanism by utilizing historical alignment information. However, this approach has limitations in addressing under-parsing since it cannot correct the erroneous attention on image areas that should be parsed at subsequent decoding steps. This faulty attention causes the attention module to incorporate future context into the current decoding step, thereby confusing the alignment process. To address this issue, we propose an attention guidance mechanism to explicitly suppress attention weights in irrelevant areas and enhance the appropriate ones, thereby inhibiting access to information outside the intended context. Depending on the type of attention guidance, we devise two complementary approaches to refine attention weights: self-guidance that coordinates attention of multiple heads and neighbor-guidance that integrates attention from adjacent time steps. Experiments show that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving expression recognition rates of 60.75% / 61.81% / 63.30% on the CROHME 2014/ 2016/ 2019 datasets.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recently, model merging techniques have surfaced as a solution to combine multiple single-talent models into a single multi-talent model. However, previous endeavors in this field have either necessitated additional training or <b>fine-tuning</b> processes, or require that the models possess the same pre-trained initialization. In this work, we identify a common drawback in prior works w.r.t. the inconsistency of unit similarity in the weight space and the activation space. To address this inconsistency, we propose an innovative model merging framework, coined as merging under dual-space constraints (MuDSC). Specifically, instead of solely maximizing the objective of a single space, we advocate for the exploration of permutation matrices situated in a region with a unified high similarity in the dual space, achieved through the linear combination of activation and weight similarity matrices. In order to enhance usability, we have also incorporated adaptations for group structure, including Multi-Head Attention and Group Normalization. Comprehensive experimental comparisons demonstrate that MuDSC can significantly boost the performance of merged models with various task combinations and architectures. Furthermore, the visualization of the merged model within the multi-task loss landscape reveals that MuDSC enables the merged model to reside in the overlapping segment, featuring a unified lower loss for each task. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/zju-vipa/training_free_model_merging.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this paper, we present a novel point generation model, referred to as Pillar-based Point Generation Network (PillarGen), which facilitates the transformation of point clouds from one domain into another. PillarGen can produce synthetic point clouds with enhanced density and quality based on the provided input point clouds. The PillarGen model performs the following three steps: 1) pillar encoding, 2) Occupied Pillar Prediction (OPP), and 3) Pillar to Point Generation (PPG). The input point clouds are encoded using a pillar grid structure to generate pillar features. Then, OPP determines the active pillars used for point generation and predicts the center of points and the number of points to be generated for each active pillar. PPG generates the synthetic points for each active pillar based on the information provided by OPP. We evaluate the performance of PillarGen using our proprietary radar dataset, focusing on enhancing the density and quality of short-range radar data using the long-range radar data as supervision. Our experiments demonstrate that PillarGen outperforms traditional point upsampling methods in quantitative and qualitative measures. We also confirm that when PillarGen is incorporated into bird's eye view <b>object</b> <b>detection,</b> a significant improvement in detection accuracy is achieved.

**ABSTRACT**  
This work proposes to augment the lifting steps of the conventional wavelet transform with additional neural network assisted lifting steps. These additional steps reduce residual redundancy (notably aliasing information) amongst the wavelet subbands, and also improve the visual quality of reconstructed images at reduced resolutions. The proposed approach involves two steps, a high-to-low step followed by a low-to-high step. The high-to-low step suppresses aliasing in the low-pass band by using the detail bands at the same resolution, while the low-to-high step aims to further remove redundancy from detail bands, so as to achieve higher energy compaction. The proposed two lifting steps are trained in an end-to-end fashion; we employ a backward annealing approach to overcome the non-differentiability of the <b>quantization</b> and cost functions during back-propagation. Importantly, the networks employed in this paper are compact and with limited non-linearities, allowing a fully scalable system; one pair of trained network parameters are applied for all levels of decomposition and for all bit-rates of interest. By employing the proposed approach within the JPEG 2000 image coding standard, our method can achieve up to 17.4% average BD bit-rate saving over a wide range of bit-rates, while retaining quality and resolution scalability features of JPEG 2000.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recently, 3D hand reconstruction has gained more attention in human-computer cooperation, especially for hand-object interaction scenario. However, it still remains huge challenge due to severe hand-occlusion caused by interaction, which contain the balance of accuracy and physical plausibility, highly nonlinear mapping of model parameters and occlusion feature enhancement. To overcome these issues, we propose a 3D hand reconstruction network combining the benefits of model-based and model-free approaches to balance accuracy and physical plausibility for hand-object interaction scenario. Firstly, we present a novel MANO pose parameters regression module from 2D joints directly, which avoids the process of highly nonlinear mapping from abstract image feature and no longer depends on accurate 3D joints. Moreover, we further propose a vertex-joint mutual <b>graph-attention</b> model guided by MANO to jointly refine hand meshes and joints, which model the dependencies of vertex-vertex and joint-joint and capture the correlation of vertex-joint for aggregating intra-graph and inter-graph node features respectively. The experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves a competitive performance on recently <b>benchmark</b> datasets HO3DV2 and Dex-YCB, and outperforms all only model-base approaches and model-free approaches.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this paper, we address web-scale visual entity recognition, specifically the task of mapping a given query image to one of the 6 million existing entities in Wikipedia. One way of approaching a problem of such scale is using dual-encoder models (eg CLIP), where all the entity names and query images are embedded into a unified space, paving the way for an approximate k-NN search. Alternatively, it is also possible to re-purpose a captioning model to directly generate the entity names for a given image. In contrast, we introduce a novel Generative Entity Recognition (GER) framework, which given an input image learns to auto-regressively decode a semantic and discriminative ``code'' identifying the target entity. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy of this GER paradigm, showcasing state-of-the-art performance on the challenging OVEN <b>benchmark.</b> GER surpasses strong captioning, dual-encoder, visual matching and hierarchical classification baselines, affirming its advantage in tackling the complexities of web-scale recognition.

**ABSTRACT**  
Deep <b>clustering</b> has exhibited remarkable performance; however, the overconfidence problem, i.e., the estimated confidence for a sample belonging to a particular cluster greatly exceeds its actual prediction accuracy, has been overlooked in prior research. To tackle this critical issue, we pioneer the development of a calibrated deep <b>clustering</b> framework. Specifically, we propose a novel dual-head deep <b>clustering</b> pipeline that can effectively calibrate the estimated confidence and the actual accuracy. The calibration head adjusts the overconfident predictions of the <b>clustering</b> head using regularization methods, generating prediction confidence and pseudo-labels that match the model learning status. This calibration process also guides the <b>clustering</b> head in dynamically selecting reliable high-confidence samples for training. Additionally, we introduce an effective network initialization strategy that enhances both training speed and network robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate the proposed calibrated deep <b>clustering</b> framework not only surpasses state-of-the-art deep <b>clustering</b> methods by approximately 10 times in terms of expected calibration error but also significantly outperforms them in terms of <b>clustering</b> accuracy.

**ABSTRACT**  
Accurate and consistent methods for counting trees based on remote sensing data are needed to support sustainable forest management, assess climate change mitigation strategies, and build trust in tree carbon credits. Two-dimensional remote sensing imagery primarily shows overstory canopy, and it does not facilitate easy differentiation of individual trees in areas with a dense canopy and does not allow for easy separation of trees when the canopy is dense. We leverage the fusion of three-dimensional LiDAR measurements and 2D imagery to facilitate the accurate counting of trees. We compare a deep learning approach to counting trees in forests using 3D airborne LiDAR data and 2D imagery. The approach is compared with state-of-the-art algorithms, like operating on 3D point cloud and 2D imagery. We empirically evaluate the different methods on the NeonTreeCount data set, which we use to define a tree-counting <b>benchmark.</b> The experiments show that FuseCountNet yields more accurate tree counts.

**ABSTRACT**  
We present ZSL-RPPO, an improved <b>zero-shot</b> <b>learning</b> architecture that overcomes the limitations of teacher-student neural networks and enables generating robust, reliable, and versatile locomotion for quadrupedal robots in challenging terrains. We propose a new algorithm RPPO <b>(Recurrent</b> <b>Proximal</b> <b>Policy</b> Optimization) that directly trains <b>recurrent</b> <b>neural</b> <b>network</b> in partially observable environments and results in more robust training using domain randomization. Our locomotion controller supports extensive perturbation across <b>simulation-to-reality</b> transfer for both intrinsic and extrinsic physical parameters without further <b>fine-tuning.</b> This can avoid the significant decline of student's performance during <b>simulation-to-reality</b> transfer and therefore enhance the robustness and generalization of the locomotion controller. We deployed our controller on the Unitree A1 and Aliengo robots in real environment and exteroceptive perception is provided by either a solid-state Lidar or a depth camera. Our locomotion controller was tested in various challenging terrains like slippery surfaces, Grassy Terrain, and stairs. Our experiment results and comparison show that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art.

**ABSTRACT**  
Offline goal-conditioned <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning</b> (GCRL) aims at solving goal-reaching tasks with sparse rewards from an offline dataset. While prior work has demonstrated various approaches for agents to learn near-optimal policies, these methods encounter limitations when dealing with diverse constraints in complex environments, such as safety constraints. Some of these approaches prioritize goal attainment without considering safety, while others excessively focus on safety at the expense of training efficiency. In this paper, we study the problem of constrained offline GCRL and propose a new method called Recovery-based <b>Supervised</b> <b>Learning</b> (RbSL) to accomplish safety-critical tasks with various goals. To evaluate the method performance, we build a <b>benchmark</b> based on the robot-fetching environment with a randomly positioned obstacle and use expert or random policies to generate an offline dataset. We compare RbSL with three offline GCRL algorithms and one offline safe RL algorithm. As a result, our method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods to a large extent. Furthermore, we validate the practicality and effectiveness of RbSL by deploying it on a real Panda manipulator. Code is available at https://github.com/Sunlighted/RbSL.git.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper proposes an informative trajectory planning approach, namely, \textit{adaptive particle filter tree with sigma point-based <b>mutual</b> <b>information</b> reward approximation} (ASPIRe), for mobile target search and tracking (SAT) in cluttered environments with limited sensing field of view. We develop a novel sigma point-based approximation to accurately estimate <b>mutual</b> <b>information</b> (MI) for general, non-Gaussian distributions utilizing particle representation of the belief state, while simultaneously maintaining high computational efficiency. Building upon the MI approximation, we develop the Adaptive Particle Filter Tree (APFT) approach with MI as the reward, which features belief state tree nodes for informative trajectory planning in continuous state and measurement spaces. An adaptive criterion is proposed in APFT to adjust the planning horizon based on the expected information gain. <b>Simulations</b> and physical experiments demonstrate that ASPIRe achieves real-time computation and outperforms <b>benchmark</b> methods in terms of both search efficiency and estimation accuracy.

**ABSTRACT**  
The prevailing grasp prediction methods predominantly rely on offline learning, overlooking the dynamic grasp learning that occurs during real-time adaptation to novel picking scenarios. These scenarios may involve previously unseen objects, variations in camera perspectives, and bin configurations, among other factors. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, SSL-ConvSAC, that combines <b>semi-supervised</b> <b>learning</b> and <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning</b> for online grasp learning. By treating pixels with reward feedback as labeled data and others as unlabeled, it efficiently exploits unlabeled data to enhance learning. In addition, we address the imbalance between labeled and unlabeled data by proposing a contextual <b>curriculum-based</b> <b>method.</b> We ablate the proposed approach on real-world evaluation data and demonstrate promise for improving online grasp learning on bin picking tasks using a physical 7-DoF Franka Emika robot arm with a suction gripper.

**ABSTRACT**  
Manipulating objects with two multi-fingered hands has been a long-standing challenge in robotics, attributed to the contact-rich nature of many manipulation tasks and the complexity inherent in coordinating a high-dimensional bimanual system. In this work, we consider the problem of twisting lids of various bottle-like objects with two hands, and demonstrate that policies trained in <b>simulation</b> using deep <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning</b> can be effectively transferred to the real world. With novel engineering insights into physical modeling, real-time perception, and reward design, the policy demonstrates generalization capabilities across a diverse set of unseen objects, showcasing dynamic and dexterous behaviors. Our findings serve as compelling evidence that deep <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning</b> combined with sim-to-real transfer remains a promising approach for addressing manipulation problems of unprecedented complexity.

**ABSTRACT**  
Learning-based methods have improved locomotion skills of quadruped robots through deep <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning.</b> However, the sim-to-real gap and low sample efficiency still limit the skill transfer. To address this issue, we propose an efficient model-based learning framework that combines a world model with a policy network. We train a differentiable world model to predict future states and use it to directly supervise a <b>Variational</b> <b>Autoencoder</b> (VAE)-based policy network to imitate real animal behaviors. This significantly reduces the need for real interaction data and allows for rapid policy updates. We also develop a high-level network to track diverse commands and trajectories. Our simulated results show a tenfold sample efficiency increase compared to <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning</b> methods such as PPO. In real-world testing, our policy achieves proficient command-following performance with only a two-minute data collection period and generalizes well to new speeds and paths.

**ABSTRACT**  
Multi-robot systems have increasingly become instrumental in tackling search and coverage problems. However, the challenge of optimizing task efficiency without compromising task success still persists, particularly in expansive, unstructured environments with dense obstacles. This paper presents an innovative, decentralized Voronoi-based approach for search and coverage to reactively navigate these complexities while maintaining safety. This approach leverages the active sensing capabilities of multi-robot systems to supplement GIS (Geographic Information System), offering a more comprehensive and real-time understanding of the environment. Based on point cloud data, which is inherently non-convex and unstructured, this method efficiently generates collision-free Voronoi regions using only local sensing information through spatial decomposition and spherical mirroring techniques. Then, deadlock-aware guided map integrated with a gradient-optimized, centroid Voronoi-based coverage control policy, is constructed to improve efficiency by avoiding exhaustive searches and local sensing pitfalls. The effectiveness of our algorithm has been validated through extensive numerical <b>simulations</b> in high-fidelity environments, demonstrating significant improvements in both task success rate, coverage ratio, and task execution time compared with others.

**ABSTRACT**  
Integrating robotics into human-centric environments such as homes, necessitates advanced manipulation skills as robotic devices will need to engage with articulated objects like doors and drawers. Key challenges in robotic manipulation are the unpredictability and diversity of these objects' internal structures, which render models based on priors, both explicit and implicit, inadequate. Their reliability is significantly diminished by pre-interaction ambiguities, imperfect structural parameters, encounters with unknown objects, and unforeseen disturbances. Here, we present a prior-free strategy, Tac-Man, focusing on maintaining stable robot-object contact during manipulation. Utilizing tactile feedback, but independent of object priors, Tac-Man enables robots to proficiently handle a variety of articulated objects, including those with complex joints, even when influenced by unexpected disturbances. Demonstrated in both real-world experiments and extensive <b>simulations,</b> it consistently achieves near-perfect success in dynamic and varied settings, outperforming existing methods. Our results indicate that tactile sensing alone suffices for managing diverse articulated objects, offering greater robustness and generalization than prior-based approaches. This underscores the importance of detailed contact modeling in complex manipulation tasks, especially with articulated objects. Advancements in tactile sensors significantly expand the scope of robotic applications in human-centric environments, particularly where accurate models are difficult to obtain.

**ABSTRACT**  
Autonomous open-ended learning (OEL) robots are able to cumulatively acquire new skills and knowledge through direct interaction with the environment, for example relying on the guidance of intrinsic motivations and self-generated goals. OEL robots have a high relevance for applications as they can use the autonomously acquired knowledge to accomplish tasks relevant for their human users. OEL robots, however, encounter an important limitation: this may lead to the acquisition of knowledge that is not so much relevant to accomplish the users' tasks. This work analyses a possible solution to this problem that pivots on the novel concept of `purpose'. Purposes indicate what the designers and/or users want from the robot. The robot should use internal representations of purposes, called here `desires', to focus its open-ended exploration towards the acquisition of knowledge relevant to accomplish them. This work contributes to develop a computational framework on purpose in two ways. First, it formalises a framework on purpose based on a three-level motivational hierarchy involving: (a) the purposes; (b) the desires, which are domain independent; (c) specific domain dependent state-goals. Second, the work highlights key challenges highlighted by the framework such as: the `purpose-desire alignment problem', the `purpose-goal <b>grounding</b> problem', and the `arbitration between desires'. Overall, the approach enables OEL robots to learn in an autonomous way but also to focus on acquiring goals and skills that meet the purposes of the designers and users.

**ABSTRACT**  
Training a robotic policy from scratch using deep <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning</b> methods can be prohibitively expensive due to sample inefficiency. To address this challenge, transferring policies trained in the source domain to the target domain becomes an attractive paradigm. Previous research has typically focused on domains with similar state and action spaces but differing in other aspects. In this paper, our primary focus lies in domains with different state and action spaces, which has broader practical implications, i.e. transfer the policy from robot A to robot B. Unlike prior methods that rely on paired data, we propose a novel approach for learning the mapping functions between state and action spaces across domains using unpaired data. We propose effect cycle consistency, which aligns the effects of transitions across two domains through a symmetrical optimization structure for learning these mapping functions. Once the mapping functions are learned, we can seamlessly transfer the policy from the source domain to the target domain. Our approach has been tested on three locomotion tasks and two robotic manipulation tasks. The empirical results demonstrate that our method can reduce alignment errors significantly and achieve better performance compared to the state-of-the-art method.

**ABSTRACT**  
Language provides a way to break down complex concepts into digestible pieces. Recent works in robot imitation learning use language-conditioned policies that predict actions given visual observations and the high-level task specified in language. These methods leverage the structure of natural language to share data between semantically similar tasks (e.g., "pick coke can" and "pick an apple") in multi-task datasets. However, as tasks become more semantically diverse (e.g., "pick coke can" and "pour cup"), sharing data between tasks becomes harder, so learning to map high-level tasks to actions requires much more demonstration data. To bridge tasks and actions, our insight is to teach the robot the language of actions, describing low-level motions with more fine-grained phrases like "move arm forward". Predicting these language motions as an intermediate step between tasks and actions forces the policy to learn the shared structure of low-level motions across seemingly disparate tasks. Furthermore, a policy that is conditioned on language motions can easily be corrected during execution through <b>human-specified</b> <b>language</b> motions. This enables a new paradigm for flexible policies that can learn from <b>human</b> <b>intervention</b> in language. Our method RT-H builds an action hierarchy using language motions: it first learns to predict language motions, and conditioned on this and the high-level task, it predicts actions, using visual context at all stages. We show that RT-H leverages this language-action hierarchy to learn policies that are more robust and flexible by effectively tapping into multi-task datasets. We show that these policies not only allow for responding to language interventions, but can also learn from such interventions and outperform methods that learn from teleoperated interventions.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recent advancements in <b>multimodal</b> Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) datasets have highlighted the fusion of speech and gesture, expanding robots' capabilities to absorb explicit and implicit HRI insights. However, existing speech-gesture HRI datasets often focus on elementary tasks, like object pointing and pushing, revealing limitations in scaling to intricate domains and prioritizing human command data over robot behavior records. To bridge these gaps, we introduce NatSGD, a <b>multimodal</b> HRI dataset encompassing human commands through speech and gestures that are natural, synchronized with robot behavior demonstrations. NatSGD serves as a foundational resource at the intersection of machine learning and HRI research, and we demonstrate its effectiveness in training robots to understand tasks through <b>multimodal</b> human commands, emphasizing the significance of jointly considering speech and gestures. We have released our dataset, simulator, and code to facilitate future research in human-robot interaction system learning; access these resources at https://www.snehesh.com/natsgd/

**ABSTRACT**  
Improving the safety of collaborative manipulators necessitates the reduction of inertia in the moving part. Within this paper, we introduce a novel approach in the form of a passive 3D wire aligner, serving as a lightweight and low-friction power transmission mechanism, thus achieving the desired low inertia in the manipulator's operation. Through the utilization of this innovation, the consolidation of hefty actuators onto the root link becomes feasible, consequently enabling a supple drive characterized by minimal friction. To demonstrate the efficacy of this device, we fabricate an ultralight 7 degrees of freedom (DoF) manipulator named SAQIEL, boasting a mere 1.5 <b>kg</b> weight for its moving components. Notably, to mitigate friction within SAQIEL's actuation system, we employ a distinctive mechanism that directly winds wires using motors, obviating the need for traditional gear or belt-based speed reduction mechanisms. Through a series of empirical trials, we substantiate that SAQIEL adeptly strikes balance between lightweight design, substantial payload capacity, elevated velocity, precision, and adaptability.

**ABSTRACT**  
While maximizing line-of-sight coverage of specific regions or agents in the environment is a well explored path planning objective, the converse problem of minimizing exposure to the entire environment during navigation is especially interesting in the context of minimizing detection risk. This work demonstrates that minimizing line-of-sight exposure to the environment is non-Markovian, which cannot be efficiently solved optimally with traditional path planning. The optimality gap of the <b>graph-search</b> algorithm A* and the trade-offs in optimality vs. computation time of several approximating heuristics is explored. Finally, the concept of equal-exposure corridors, which afford polynomial time determination of all paths that do not increase exposure, is presented.

**ABSTRACT**  
Autonomous driving systems face the formidable challenge of navigating intricate and dynamic environments with uncertainty. This study presents a unified prediction and planning framework that concurrently models short-term aleatoric uncertainty (SAU), long-term aleatoric uncertainty (LAU), and epistemic uncertainty (EU) to predict and establish a robust foundation for planning in dynamic contexts. The framework uses Gaussian mixture models and deep ensemble methods, to concurrently capture and assess SAU, LAU, and EU, where traditional methods do not integrate these uncertainties simultaneously. Additionally, uncertainty-aware planning is introduced, considering various uncertainties. The study's contributions include comparisons of uncertainty estimations, risk modeling, and planning methods in comparison to existing approaches. The proposed methods were rigorously evaluated using the CommonRoad <b>benchmark</b> and settings with limited perception. These experiments illuminated the advantages and roles of different uncertainty factors in autonomous driving processes. In addition, comparative assessments of various uncertainty modeling strategies underscore the benefits of modeling multiple types of uncertainties, thus enhancing planning accuracy and reliability. The proposed framework facilitates the development of methods for UAP and surpasses existing uncertainty-aware risk models, particularly when considering diverse traffic scenarios.

**ABSTRACT**  
Autonomous navigation is one of the key requirements for every potential application of mobile robots in the real-world. Besides high-accuracy state estimation, a suitable and globally consistent representation of the 3D environment is indispensable. We present a fully tightly-coupled LiDAR-Visual-Inertial SLAM system and 3D mapping framework applying local submapping strategies to achieve scalability to large-scale environments. A novel and correspondence-free, inherently probabilistic, formulation of LiDAR residuals is introduced, expressed only in terms of the occupancy fields and its respective gradients. These residuals can be added to a factor <b>graph</b> optimisation problem, either as frame-to-map factors for the live estimates or as map-to-map factors aligning the submaps with respect to one another. Experimental validation demonstrates that the approach achieves state-of-the-art pose accuracy and furthermore produces globally consistent volumetric occupancy submaps which can be directly used in downstream tasks such as navigation or exploration.

**ABSTRACT**  
We present LiSTA (LiDAR Spatio-Temporal Analysis), a system to detect probabilistic object-level change over time using multi-mission SLAM. Many applications require such a system, including construction, robotic navigation, long-term autonomy, and environmental monitoring. We focus on the semi-static scenario where objects are added, subtracted, or changed in position over weeks or months. Our system combines multi-mission LiDAR SLAM, volumetric differencing, object instance description, and correspondence grouping using learned descriptors to keep track of an open set of objects. Object correspondences between missions are determined by <b>clustering</b> the object's learned descriptors. We demonstrate our approach using datasets collected in a simulated environment and a real-world dataset captured using a LiDAR system mounted on a quadruped robot monitoring an industrial facility containing static, semi-static, and dynamic objects. Our method demonstrates superior performance in detecting changes in semi-static environments compared to existing methods.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this letter, we present a novel bi-modal bi-copter robot called Skater, which is adaptable to air and various ground surfaces. Skater consists of a bi-copter moving along its longitudinal direction with two passive wheels on both sides. Using longitudinally arranged bi-copter as the unified actuation system for both aerial and ground modes, this robot not only keeps concise and lightweight mechanism, but also possesses exceptional terrain traversing capability and strong steering capacity. Moreover, leveraging the vectored thrust characteristic of bi-copters, Skater can actively generate the centripetal force needed for steering, enabling it to achieve stable movement even on slippery surfaces. Furthermore, we model the comprehensive dynamics of Skater, analyze its differential flatness and introduce a controller using nonlinear model predictive control for trajectory tracking. The outstanding performance of the system is verified by extensive real-world experiments and <b>benchmark</b> comparisons.

**ABSTRACT**  
Robot navigation under visual corruption presents a formidable challenge. To address this, we propose a Test-time Adaptation (TTA) method, named as TTA-Nav, for point-goal navigation under visual corruptions. Our "plug-and-play" method incorporates a top-down decoder to a pre-trained navigation model. Firstly, the pre-trained navigation model gets a corrupted image and extracts features. Secondly, the top-down decoder produces the reconstruction given the high-level features extracted by the pre-trained model. Then, it feeds the reconstruction of a corrupted image back to the pre-trained model. Finally, the pre-trained model does forward pass again to output action. Despite being trained solely on clean images, the top-down decoder can reconstruct cleaner images from corrupted ones without the need for gradient-based adaptation. The pre-trained navigation model with our top-down decoder significantly enhances navigation performance across almost all visual corruptions in our <b>benchmarks.</b> Our method improves the success rate of point-goal navigation from the state-of-the-art result of 46% to 94% on the most severe corruption. This suggests its potential for broader application in robotic visual navigation.

**ABSTRACT**  
Aerial robots show significant potential for forest canopy research and environmental monitoring by providing data collection capabilities at high spatial and temporal resolutions. However, limited flight endurance hinders their application. Inspired by natural perching behaviours, we propose a <b>multi-modal</b> aerial robot system that integrates tensile perching for energy conservation and a suspended actuated pod for data collection. The system consists of a quadrotor drone, a slewing ring mechanism allowing 360{\deg} tether rotation, and a streamlined pod with two ducted propellers connected via a tether. Winding and unwinding the tether allows the pod to move within the canopy, and activating the propellers allows the tether to be wrapped around branches for perching or disentangling. We experimentally determined the minimum counterweights required for stable perching under various conditions. Building on this, we devised and evaluated multiple perching and disentangling strategies. Comparisons of perching and disentangling manoeuvres demonstrate energy savings that could be further maximized with the use of the pod or tether winding. These approaches can reduce energy consumption to only 22\% and 1.5\%, respectively, compared to a drone disentangling manoeuvre. We also calculated the minimum idle time required by the proposed system after the system perching and motor shut down to save energy on a mission, which is 48.9\% of the operating time. Overall, the integrated system expands the operational capabilities and enhances the energy efficiency of aerial robots for long-term monitoring tasks.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Large</b> <b>Language</b> <b>Models</b> <b>(LLMs)</b> have demonstrated remarkable <b>reasoning</b> abilities, <b>prompting</b> interest in their application as <b>black-box</b> <b>optimizers.</b> This paper asserts that <b>LLMs</b> possess the capability for <b>zero-shot</b> optimization across diverse scenarios, including multi-objective and high-dimensional problems. We introduce a novel population-based method for numerical optimization using <b>LLMs</b> called Language-Model-Based Evolutionary Optimizer (LEO). Our hypothesis is supported through numerical examples, spanning <b>benchmark</b> and industrial engineering problems such as supersonic nozzle shape optimization, heat transfer, and windfarm layout optimization. We compare our method to several gradient-based and gradient-free optimization approaches. While <b>LLMs</b> yield comparable results to state-of-the-art methods, their imaginative nature and propensity to hallucinate demand careful handling. We provide practical guidelines for obtaining reliable answers from <b>LLMs</b> and discuss method limitations and potential research directions.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper studies how <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> <b>(LLMs)</b> can act as effective, high-level creative collaborators and ``muses'' for game design. We model the design of this study after the exercises artists use by looking at amorphous ink splotches for creative inspiration. Our goal is to determine whether AI-assistance can improve, hinder, or provide an alternative quality to games when compared to the creative intents implemented by human designers. The capabilities of <b>LLMs</b> as game designers are stress tested by placing it at the forefront of the decision making process. Three prototype games are designed across 3 different genres: (1) a minimalist base game, (2) a game with features and game feel elements added by a human game designer, and (3) a game with features and feel elements directly implemented from <b>prompted</b> outputs of the <b>LLM,</b> <b>ChatGPT.</b> A user study was conducted and participants were asked to blindly evaluate the quality and their preference of these games. We discuss both the development process of communicating creative intent to an AI <b>chatbot</b> and the synthesized open feedback of the participants. We use this data to determine both the benefits and shortcomings of AI in a more design-centric role.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> <b>(LLMs)</b> such as <b>ChatGPT</b> are increasingly proficient in understanding and generating a mixture of <b>code</b> <b>and</b> text. Evaluation based on such $\textit{mixture}$ can lead to a more comprehensive understanding of the models' abilities in solving coding problems. However, in this context, current evaluation methods are either limited in task coverage or lack standardization. To address this issue, we propose using category theory as a framework for evaluation. Specifically, morphisms within a <b>code</b> <b>category</b> can represent <b>code</b> <b>debugging</b> and transformation, functors between two categories represent <b>code</b> <b>translation,</b> and functors between a <b>code</b> <b>category</b> and a natural language category represent <b>code</b> <b>generation,</b> explanation, and reproduction. We present an <b>automatic</b> <b>evaluation</b> framework called $\textbf{CatCode}$ ($\textbf{Cat}$egory $\textbf{Code}$) that can comprehensively assess the coding abilities of <b>LLMs,</b> including <b>ChatGPT,</b> Text-Davinci, and CodeGeeX.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recently, <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> <b>(LLMs)</b> have notably positioned them as capable tools for addressing complex optimization challenges. Despite this recognition, a predominant limitation of existing <b>LLM-based</b> optimization methods is their struggle to capture the relationships among decision variables when relying exclusively on numerical text <b>prompts,</b> especially in high-dimensional problems. Keeping this in mind, we first propose to enhance the optimization performance using <b>multimodal</b> <b>LLM</b> capable of processing both textual and visual <b>prompts</b> for deeper insights of the processed optimization problem. This integration allows for a more comprehensive understanding of optimization problems, akin to human cognitive processes. We have developed a <b>multimodal</b> <b>LLM-based</b> optimization framework that simulates human problem-solving workflows, thereby offering a more nuanced and effective analysis. The efficacy of this method is evaluated through extensive empirical studies focused on a well-known combinatorial optimization problem, i.e., capacitated vehicle routing problem. The results are compared against those obtained from the <b>LLM-based</b> optimization algorithms that rely solely on textual <b>prompts,</b> demonstrating the significant advantages of our <b>multimodal</b> approach.

**ABSTRACT**  
The Bellman equation and its <b>continuous</b> <b>form,</b> the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, are ubiquitous in <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning</b> (RL) and control theory. However, these equations quickly become intractable for systems with high-dimensional states and nonlinearity. This paper explores the connection between the data-driven Koopman operator and Markov Decision Processes <b>(MDPs),</b> resulting in the development of two new RL algorithms to address these limitations. We leverage Koopman operator techniques to lift a nonlinear system into new coordinates where the dynamics become approximately linear, and where HJB-based methods are more tractable. In particular, the Koopman operator is able to capture the expectation of the time evolution of the value function of a given system via linear dynamics in the lifted coordinates. By parameterizing the Koopman operator with the control actions, we construct a ``Koopman tensor'' that facilitates the estimation of the optimal value function. Then, a transformation of Bellman's framework in terms of the Koopman tensor enables us to reformulate two max-entropy RL algorithms: soft value iteration and soft actor-critic (SAC). This highly flexible framework can be used for deterministic or stochastic systems as well as for discrete or <b>continuous-time</b> <b>dynamics.</b> Finally, we show that these Koopman Assisted <b>Reinforcement</b> <b>Learning</b> (KARL) algorithms attain state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with respect to traditional neural network-based SAC and linear quadratic regulator (LQR) baselines on four controlled dynamical systems: a linear state-space system, the Lorenz system, fluid flow past a cylinder, and a double-well potential with non-isotropic stochastic forcing.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recent studies of the applications of conversational AI tools, such as <b>chatbots</b> powered by <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models,</b> to complex real-world knowledge work have shown limitations related to <b>reasoning</b> and multi-step problem solving. Specifically, while existing <b>chatbots</b> simulate shallow <b>reasoning</b> and understanding they are prone to errors as problem complexity increases. The failure of these systems to address complex knowledge work is due to the fact that they do not perform any actual cognition. In this position paper, we present Cognitive AI, a higher-level framework for implementing programmatically defined neuro-symbolic cognition above and outside of <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models.</b> Specifically, we propose a dual-layer functional architecture for Cognitive AI that serves as a roadmap for AI systems that can perform complex multi-step knowledge work. We propose that Cognitive AI is a necessary precursor for the evolution of higher forms of AI, such as AGI, and specifically claim that AGI cannot be achieved by probabilistic approaches on their own. We conclude with a discussion of the implications for <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models,</b> adoption cycles in AI, and commercial Cognitive AI development.

**ABSTRACT**  
The transportation sector remains a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. The understanding of energy-efficient driving behaviors and utilization of energy-efficient driving strategies are essential to reduce vehicles' fuel consumption. However, there is no comprehensive investigation into energy-efficient driving behaviors and strategies. Furthermore, many state-of-the-art AI models have been applied for the analysis of eco-friendly driving styles, but no overview is available. To fill the gap, this paper conducts a thorough literature review on ecological driving behaviors and styles and analyzes the driving factors influencing energy consumption and state-of-the-art methodologies. With a thorough scoping review process, the methodological and related data are compared. The results show that the factors that impact driving behaviors can be <b>summarized</b> into eleven features including speed, acceleration, deceleration, pedal, and so on. This paper finds that supervised/unsupervised learning algorithms and <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning</b> frameworks have been popularly used to model the vehicle's energy consumption with multi-dimensional data. Furthermore, the literature shows that the driving data are collected from either simulators or real-world experiments, and the real-world data are mainly stored and transmitted by meters, controller area networks, onboard data services, smartphones, and additional sensors installed in the vehicle. Based on driving behavior factors, driver characteristics, and safety rules, this paper recommends nine energy-efficient driving styles including four guidelines for the drivers' selection and adjustment of the vehicle parameters, three <b>recommendations</b> for the energy-efficient driving styles in different driving scenarios, and two subjective suggestions for different types of drivers and employers.

**ABSTRACT**  
The <b>transformer</b> models have been extensively used with good results in a wide area of machine learning applications including <b>Large</b> <b>Language</b> <b>Models</b> and image generation. Here, we inquire on the applicability of this approach to financial time series. We first describe the dataset construction for two prototypical situations: a mean reverting synthetic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process on one hand and real S&P500 data on the other hand. Then, we present in detail the proposed <b>Transformer</b> architecture and finally we discuss some encouraging results. For the synthetic data we predict rather accurately the next move, and for the S&P500 we get some interesting results related to quadratic variation and volatility prediction.

**ABSTRACT**  
Instead of making behavioral decisions directly from the exponentially expanding joint observational-action space, subtask-based multi-agent <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning</b> (MARL) methods enable agents to learn how to tackle different subtasks. Most existing subtask-based MARL methods are based on hierarchical <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning</b> (HRL). However, these approaches often limit the number of subtasks, perform subtask recognition periodically, and can only identify and execute a specific subtask within the predefined fixed time period, which makes them inflexible and not suitable for diverse and dynamic scenarios with constantly changing subtasks. To break through above restrictions, a \textbf{S}liding \textbf{M}ultidimensional t\textbf{A}sk window based m\textbf{U}ti-agent <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learnin\textbf{G}</b> framework (SMAUG) is proposed for adaptive real-time subtask recognition. It leverages a sliding multidimensional task window to extract essential information of subtasks from trajectory segments concatenated based on observed and predicted trajectories in varying lengths. An inference network is designed to iteratively predict future trajectories with the subtask-oriented policy network. Furthermore, intrinsic motivation rewards are defined to promote subtask exploration and behavior diversity. SMAUG can be integrated with any Q-learning-based approach. Experiments on StarCraft II show that SMAUG not only demonstrates performance superiority in comparison with all baselines but also presents a more prominent and swift rise in rewards during the initial training stage.

**ABSTRACT**  
While deep learning has celebrated many successes, its results often hinge on the meticulous selection of hyperparameters (HPs). However, the time-consuming nature of deep learning training makes HP optimization (HPO) a costly endeavor, slowing down the development of efficient HPO tools. While zero-cost <b>benchmarks,</b> which provide performance and runtime without actual training, offer a solution for non-parallel setups, they fall short in parallel setups as each worker must communicate its queried runtime to return its evaluation in the exact order. This work addresses this challenge by introducing a user-friendly Python package that facilitates efficient parallel HPO with zero-cost <b>benchmarks.</b> Our approach calculates the exact return order based on the information stored in file system, eliminating the need for long waiting times and enabling much faster HPO evaluations. We first verify the correctness of our approach through extensive testing and the experiments with 6 popular HPO libraries show its applicability to diverse libraries and its ability to achieve over 1000x speedup compared to a traditional approach. Our package can be installed via pip install mfhpo-simulator.

**ABSTRACT**  
In multicriteria decision-making, a user seeks a set of non-dominated solutions to a (constrained) multiobjective optimization problem, the so-called Pareto frontier. In this work, we seek to bring a state-of-the-art method for exact multiobjective integer linear programming into the heuristic realm. We focus on binary decision diagrams (BDDs) which first construct a <b>graph</b> that represents all feasible solutions to the problem and then traverse the <b>graph</b> to extract the Pareto frontier. Because the Pareto frontier may be exponentially large, enumerating it over the BDD can be time-consuming. We explore how restricted BDDs, which have already been shown to be effective as heuristics for single-objective problems, can be adapted to multiobjective optimization through the use of machine learning (ML). MORBDD, our ML-based BDD sparsifier, first trains a binary classifier to eliminate BDD nodes that are unlikely to contribute to Pareto solutions, then post-processes the sparse BDD to ensure its connectivity via optimization. Experimental results on multiobjective knapsack problems show that MORBDD is highly effective at producing very small restricted BDDs with excellent approximation quality, outperforming width-limited restricted BDDs and the well-known evolutionary algorithm NSGA-II.

**ABSTRACT**  
The proliferation of software vulnerabilities poses a significant challenge for security databases and analysts tasked with their timely identification, classification, and remediation. With the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) reporting an ever-increasing number of vulnerabilities, the traditional manual analysis becomes untenably time-consuming and prone to errors. This paper introduces VulnScopper, an innovative approach that utilizes <b>multi-modal</b> <b>representation</b> <b>learning,</b> combining <b>Knowledge</b> <b>Graphs</b> <b>(KG)</b> and Natural Language Processing (NLP), to automate and enhance the analysis of software vulnerabilities. Leveraging ULTRA, a <b>knowledge</b> <b>graph</b> <b>foundation</b> <b>model,</b> combined with a <b>Large</b> <b>Language</b> <b>Model</b> <b>(LLM),</b> VulnScopper effectively handles unseen entities, overcoming the limitations of previous <b>KG</b> approaches. We evaluate VulnScopper on two major security datasets, the NVD and the Red Hat CVE database. Our method significantly improves the link prediction accuracy between Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs), Common Weakness Enumeration (CWEs), and Common Platform Enumerations (CPEs). Our results show that VulnScopper outperforms existing methods, achieving up to 78% Hits@10 accuracy in linking CVEs to CPEs and CWEs and presenting an 11.7% improvement over <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> in predicting CWE labels based on the Red Hat database. Based on the NVD, only 6.37% of the linked CPEs are being published during the first 30 days; many of them are related to critical and high-risk vulnerabilities which, according to multiple compliance frameworks (such as CISA and PCI), should be remediated within 15-30 days. Our model can uncover new products linked to vulnerabilities, reducing remediation time and improving vulnerability management. We analyzed several CVEs from 2023 to showcase this ability.

**ABSTRACT**  
Phishing attacks have inflicted substantial losses on individuals and businesses alike, necessitating the development of robust and efficient automated phishing detection approaches. Reference-based phishing detectors (RBPDs), which compare the logos on a target webpage to a known set of logos, have emerged as the state-of-the-art approach. However, a major limitation of existing RBPDs is that they rely on a manually constructed brand <b>knowledge</b> <b>base,</b> making it infeasible to scale to a <b>large</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> brands, which results in false negative errors due to the insufficient brand coverage of the <b>knowledge</b> <b>base.</b> To address this issue, we propose an automated <b>knowledge</b> <b>collection</b> pipeline, using which we collect and release a <b>large-scale</b> <b>multimodal</b> <b>brand</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>base,</b> KnowPhish, containing 20k brands with rich information about each brand. KnowPhish can be used to boost the performance of existing RBPDs in a plug-and-play manner. A second limitation of existing RBPDs is that they solely rely on the image modality, ignoring useful textual information present in the webpage HTML. To utilize this textual information, we propose a <b>Large</b> <b>Language</b> <b>Model</b> <b>(LLM)-based</b> approach to extract brand information of webpages from text. Our resulting <b>multimodal</b> phishing detection approach, KnowPhish Detector (KPD), can detect phishing webpages with or without logos. We evaluate KnowPhish and KPD on a manually validated dataset, and on a field study under Singapore's local context, showing substantial improvements in effectiveness and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

**ABSTRACT**  
The security of cloud field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) faces challenges from untrusted users attempting fault and side-channel attacks through malicious circuit configurations. Fault injection attacks can result in denial of service, disrupting functionality or leaking secret information. This threat is further amplified in multi-tenancy scenarios. Detecting such threats before loading onto the FPGA is crucial, but existing methods face difficulty identifying sophisticated attacks. We present MaliGNNoma, a machine learning-based solution that accurately identifies malicious FPGA configurations. Serving as a netlist scanning mechanism, it can be employed by cloud service providers as an initial security layer within a necessary multi-tiered security system. By leveraging the inherent <b>graph</b> <b>representation</b> <b>of</b> FPGA netlists, MaliGNNoma employs a <b>graph</b> <b>neural</b> <b>network</b> <b>(GNN)</b> to learn distinctive malicious features, surpassing current approaches. To enhance transparency, MaliGNNoma utilizes a parameterized explainer for the <b>GNN,</b> labeling the FPGA configuration and pinpointing the sub-circuit responsible for the malicious classification. Through extensive experimentation on the ZCU102 board with a Xilinx UltraScale+ FPGA, we validate the effectiveness of MaliGNNoma in detecting malicious configurations, including sophisticated attacks, such as those based on benign modules, like cryptography accelerators. MaliGNNoma achieves a classification accuracy and precision of 98.24% and 97.88%, respectively, surpassing state-of-the-art. We compare MaliGNNoma with five state-of-the-art scanning methods, revealing that not all attack vectors detected by MaliGNNoma are recognized by existing solutions, further emphasizing its effectiveness. Additionally, we make MaliGNNoma and its associated dataset publicly available.

**ABSTRACT**  
(p,q)-clique enumeration on a bipartite <b>graph</b> is critical for calculating <b>clustering</b> coefficient and detecting densest subgraph. It is necessary to carry out subgraph enumeration while protecting users' privacy from any potential attacker as the count of subgraph may contain sensitive information. Most recent studies focus on the privacy protection algorithms based on edge LDP (Local <b>Differential</b> <b>Privacy).</b> However, these algorithms suffer a large estimation error due to the great amount of required noise. In this paper, we propose a novel idea of k-stars LDP and a novel k-stars LDP algorithm for (p, q)-clique enumeration with a small estimation error, where a k-stars is a star-shaped <b>graph</b> with k nodes connecting to one node. The effectiveness of edge LDP relies on its capacity to obfuscate the existence of an edge between the user and his one-hop neighbors. This is based on the premise that a user should be aware of the existence of his one-hop neighbors. Similarly, we can apply this premise to k-stars as well, where an edge is a specific genre of 1-stars. Based on this fact, we first propose the k-stars neighboring list to enable our algorithm to obfuscate the existence of k-stars with Warner' s RR. Then, we propose the absolute value correction technique and the k-stars sampling technique to further reduce the estimation error. Finally, with the two-round user-collector interaction mechanism, we propose our k-stars LDP algorithm to count the number of (p, q)-clique while successfully protecting users' privacy. Both the theoretical analysis and experiments have showed the superiority of our algorithm over the algorithms based on edge LDP.

This study conducts a thorough examination of malware detection using machine learning techniques, focusing on the evaluation of various classification models using the Mal-API-2019 dataset. The aim is to advance cybersecurity capabilities by identifying and mitigating threats more effectively. Both ensemble and non-ensemble machine learning methods, such as Random Forest, XGBoost, K Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Neural Networks, are explored. Special emphasis is placed on the importance of data pre-processing techniques, particularly <b>TF-IDF</b> representation and Principal Component Analysis, in improving model performance. Results indicate that ensemble methods, particularly Random Forest and XGBoost, exhibit superior accuracy, precision, and recall compared to others, highlighting their effectiveness in malware detection. The paper also discusses limitations and potential future directions, emphasizing the need for continuous adaptation to address the evolving nature of malware. This research contributes to ongoing discussions in cybersecurity and provides practical insights for developing more robust malware detection systems in the digital era.

**ABSTRACT**  
Multi-tenant cloud computing provides great benefits in terms of resource sharing, elastic pricing, and scalability, however, it also changes the security landscape and introduces the need for strong isolation between the tenants, also inside the network. This paper is motivated by the observation that while multi-tenancy is widely used in cloud computing, the virtual switch designs currently used for network virtualization lack sufficient support for tenant isolation. Hence, we present, implement, and evaluate a virtual switch architecture, <b>MTS,</b> which brings secure design best-practice to the context of multi-tenant virtual networking: compartmentalization of virtual switches, least-privilege execution, complete mediation of all network communication, and reducing the trusted computing base shared between tenants. We build <b>MTS</b> from commodity components, providing an incrementally deployable and inexpensive upgrade path to cloud operators. Our extensive experiments, extending to both micro-benchmarks and cloud applications, show that, depending on the way it is deployed, <b>MTS</b> may produce 1.5-2x the throughput compared to state-of-the-art, with similar or better latency and modest resource overhead (1 extra CPU). <b>MTS</b> is available as open source software.

**ABSTRACT**  
With the escalating threats posed by cyberattacks on Industrial Control Systems (ICSs), the development of customized Industrial Intrusion Detection Systems (IIDSs) received significant attention in research. While existing literature proposes effective IIDS solutions evaluated in controlled environments, their deployment in real-world industrial settings poses several challenges. This paper highlights two critical yet often overlooked aspects that significantly impact their practical deployment, i.e., the need for sufficient amounts of data to train the IIDS models and the challenges associated with finding suitable hyperparameters, especially for IIDSs training only on genuine ICS data. Through empirical experiments conducted on multiple state-of-the-art IIDSs and diverse datasets, we establish the criticality of these issues in deploying IIDSs. Our findings show the necessity of extensive malicious training data for <b>supervised</b> IIDSs, which can be impractical considering the complexity of recording and labeling attacks in actual industrial environments. Furthermore, while other IIDSs circumvent the previous issue by requiring only benign training data, these can suffer from the difficulty of setting appropriate hyperparameters, which likewise can diminish their performance. By shedding light on these challenges, we aim to enhance the understanding of the limitations and considerations necessary for deploying effective cybersecurity solutions in ICSs, which might be one reason why IIDSs see few deployments.

**ABSTRACT**  
Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) are a crucial Privacy-Enhancing Technology (PET) leveraged by millions of users and catered by multiple VPN providers worldwide; thus, understanding the user preferences for the choice of VPN apps should be of importance and interest to the security community. To that end, prior studies looked into the usage, awareness and adoption of VPN users and the perceptions of providers. However, no study so far has looked into the user preferences and underlying reasons for switching among VPN providers and identified features that presumably enhance users' VPN experience. This work aims to bridge this gap and shed light on the underlying factors that drive existing users when they switch from one VPN to another. In this work, we analyzed over 1.3 million reviews from 20 leading VPN apps, identifying 1,305 explicit mentions and intents to switch. Our NLP-based analysis unveiled distinct clusters of factors motivating users to switch. An examination of 376 blogs from six popular VPN <b>recommendation</b> sites revealed biases in the content, and we found ignorance towards user preferences. We conclude by identifying the key implications of our work for different stakeholders. The data and code for this work is available at https://github.com/Mainack/switch-vpn-datacode-sec24.

**ABSTRACT**  
The integration of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (ML/AI) into fifth-generation (5G) networks has made evident the limitations of network intelligence with ever-increasing, strenuous requirements for current and next-generation devices. This transition to ubiquitous intelligence demands high connectivity, synchronicity, and end-to-end communication between users and network operators, and will pave the way towards full network automation without <b>human</b> <b>intervention.</b> <b>Intent-based</b> <b>networking</b> is a key factor in the reduction of <b>human</b> <b>actions,</b> roles, and responsibilities while shifting towards novel extraction and interpretation of automated network management. This paper presents the development of a custom <b>Large</b> <b>Language</b> <b>Model</b> <b>(LLM)</b> for 5G and next-generation <b>intent-based</b> <b>networking</b> and provides insights into future <b>LLM</b> developments and integrations to realize end-to-end <b>intent-based</b> <b>networking</b> for fully automated network intelligence.

**ABSTRACT**  
This study addresses the challenge of real-time metaverse applications by proposing an in-network placement and task-offloading solution for delay-constrained computing tasks in next-generation networks. The metaverse, envisioned as a parallel virtual world, requires seamless real-time experiences across diverse applications. The study introduces a software-defined networking (SDN)-based architecture and employs <b>graph</b> <b>neural</b> <b>network</b> <b>(GNN)</b> techniques for intelligent and adaptive task allocation in in-network computing (INC). Considering time constraints and computing capabilities, the proposed model optimally decides whether to offload rendering tasks to INC nodes or edge server. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed <b>GNN</b> model, achieving 97% accuracy compared to 72% for multilayer perceptron (MLP) and 70% for decision trees (DTs). The study fills the research gap in in-network placement for real-time metaverse applications, offering insights into efficient rendering task handling.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recent years have witnessed a plethora of learning-based solutions for congestion control (CC) that demonstrate better performance over traditional TCP schemes. However, they fail to provide consistently good convergence properties, including {\em fairness}, {\em fast convergence} and {\em stability}, due to the mismatch between their objective functions and these properties. Despite being intuitive, integrating these properties into existing learning-based CC is challenging, because: 1) their training environments are designed for the performance optimization of single flow but incapable of cooperative multi-flow optimization, and 2) there is no directly measurable metric to represent these properties into the training objective function. We present Astraea, a new learning-based congestion control that ensures fast convergence to <b>fairness</b> with stability. At the heart of Astraea is a multi-agent deep <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning</b> framework that explicitly optimizes these convergence properties during the training process by enabling the learning of interactive policy between multiple competing flows, while maintaining high performance. We further build a faithful multi-flow environment that emulates the competing behaviors of concurrent flows, explicitly expressing convergence properties to enable their optimization during training. We have fully implemented Astraea and our comprehensive experiments show that Astraea can quickly converge to <b>fairness</b> point and exhibit better stability than its counterparts. For example, \sys achieves near-optimal bandwidth sharing (i.e., <b>fairness)</b> when multiple flows compete for the same bottleneck, delivers up to 8.4$\times$ faster convergence speed and 2.8$\times$ smaller throughput deviation, while achieving comparable or even better performance over prior solutions.

**ABSTRACT**  
The development of next-generation networks is revolutionizing network operators' management and orchestration practices worldwide. The critical services supported by these networks require increasingly stringent performance requirements, especially when considering the aspect of network reliability. This increase in reliability, coupled with the mass generation and consumption of information <b>stemming</b> from the increasing complexity of the network and the integration of artificial intelligence agents, affects transport networks, which will be required to allow the feasibility of such services to materialize. To this end, traditional recovery schemes are inadequate to ensure the resilience requirements of next-generation critical services given the increasingly dynamic nature of the network. The work presented in this paper proposes a probabilistic and fault-tolerant robust traffic grooming model for OTN-over-DWDM networks. The model's parameterization gives network operators the ability to control the level of protection and reliability required to meet their quality of service and service level agreement guarantees. The results demonstrate that the robust solution can ensure fault tolerance even in the face of demand uncertainty without service disruptions and the need for reactive network maintenance.

**ABSTRACT**  
Cosmological <b>simulations</b> play a key role in the prediction and understanding of large scale structure formation from initial conditions. We make use of <b>GAN-based</b> <b>Autoencoders</b> (AEs) in an attempt to predict structure evolution within <b>simulations.</b> The AEs are trained on images and cubes issued from respectively 2D and 3D N-body <b>simulations</b> describing the evolution of the dark matter (DM) field. We find that while the AEs can predict structure evolution for 2D <b>simulations</b> of DM fields well, using only the density fields as input, they perform significantly more poorly in similar conditions for 3D <b>simulations.</b> However, additionally providing velocity fields as inputs greatly improves results, with similar predictions regardless of time-difference between input and target.

**ABSTRACT**  
Multi-talker <b>automatic</b> <b>speech</b> <b>recognition</b> plays a crucial role in scenarios involving multi-party interactions, such as meetings and conversations. Due to its inherent complexity, this task has been receiving increasing attention. Notably, the serialized output training (SOT) stands out among various approaches because of its simplistic architecture and exceptional performance. However, the frequent speaker changes in token-level SOT (t-SOT) present challenges for the autoregressive decoder in effectively utilizing context to predict output sequences. To address this issue, we introduce a masked t-SOT label, which serves as the cornerstone of an auxiliary training loss. Additionally, we utilize a speaker similarity matrix to refine the <b>self-attention</b> mechanism of the decoder. This strategic adjustment enhances contextual relationships within the same speaker's tokens while minimizing interactions between different speakers' tokens. We denote our method as speaker-aware SOT (SA-SOT). Experiments on the Librispeech datasets demonstrate that our SA-SOT obtains a relative cpWER reduction ranging from 12.75% to 22.03% on the multi-talker test sets. Furthermore, with more extensive training, our method achieves an impressive cpWER of 3.41%, establishing a new state-of-the-art result on the LibrispeechMix dataset.

**ABSTRACT**  
In recent years, neural network-based Wake Word Spotting achieves good performance on clean audio samples but struggles in noisy environments. Audio-Visual Wake Word Spotting (AVWWS) receives lots of attention because visual lip movement information is not affected by complex acoustic scenes. Previous works usually use simple addition or concatenation for <b>multi-modal</b> fusion. The inter-modal correlation remains relatively under-explored. In this paper, we propose a novel module called Frame-Level Cross-Modal Attention (FLCMA) to improve the performance of AVWWS systems. This module can help model <b>multi-modal</b> information at the frame-level through synchronous lip movements and speech signals. We train the end-to-end FLCMA based Audio-Visual Conformer and further improve the performance by <b>fine-tuning</b> pre-trained uni-modal models for the AVWWS task. The proposed system achieves a new state-of-the-art result (4.57% WWS score) on the far-field MISP dataset.

**ABSTRACT**  
With the advancement of generative modeling techniques, synthetic human speech becomes increasingly indistinguishable from real, and tricky challenges are elicited for the audio deepfake detection (ADD) system. In this paper, we exploit audio features to improve the generalizability of ADD systems. Investigation of the ADD task performance is conducted over a broad range of audio features, including various handcrafted features and learning-based features. Experiments show that learning-based audio features pretrained on a large amount of data generalize better than hand-crafted features on <b>out-of-domain</b> scenarios. Subsequently, we further improve the generalizability of the ADD system using proposed multi-feature approaches to incorporate complimentary information from features of different views. The model trained on ASV2019 data achieves an equal error rate of 24.27\% on the In-the-Wild dataset.

**ABSTRACT**  
Speech separation has recently made significant progress thanks to the fine-grained vision used in time-domain methods. However, several studies have shown that adopting Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) for feature extraction could be beneficial when encountering harsher conditions, such as noise or reverberation. Therefore, we propose a magnitude-conditioned time-domain framework, ConSep, to inherit the beneficial characteristics. The experiment shows that ConSep promotes performance in anechoic, noisy, and reverberant settings compared to two celebrated methods, SepFormer and Bi-Sep. Furthermore, we visualize the components of ConSep to strengthen the advantages and <b>cohere</b> with the actualities we have found in preliminary studies.

**ABSTRACT**  
We analyse the individual productivity effects of Italy's ban on <b>ChatGPT,</b> a <b>generative</b> <b>pretrained</b> <b>transformer</b> <b>chatbot.</b> We compile data on the daily coding output quantity and quality of over 36,000 GitHub users in Italy and other European countries and combine these data with the sudden announcement of the ban in a difference-in-differences framework. Among the affected users in Italy, we find a short-term increase in output quantity and quality for less experienced users and a decrease in productivity on more routine tasks for experienced users.

**ABSTRACT**  
In the imaging process of an astronomical telescope, the deconvolution of its beam or Point Spread Function (PSF) is a crucial task. However, deconvolution presents a classical and challenging inverse computation problem. In scenarios where the beam or PSF is complex or inaccurately measured, such as in interferometric arrays and certain radio telescopes, the resultant blurry images are often challenging to interpret visually or analyze using traditional physical detection methods. We argue that traditional methods frequently lack specific prior knowledge, thereby leading to suboptimal performance. To address this issue and achieve image deconvolution and reconstruction, we propose an <b>unsupervised</b> <b>network</b> architecture that incorporates prior physical information. The network adopts an encoder-decoder structure while leveraging the telescope's PSF as prior knowledge. During network training, we introduced accelerated Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) <b>convolution</b> to enable efficient processing of high-resolution input images and PSFs. We explored various classic regression networks, including <b>autoencoder</b> (AE) and U-Net, and conducted a comprehensive performance evaluation through comparative analysis.

**ABSTRACT**  
Our work addresses the challenges older adults face with commercial Voice Assistants (VAs), notably in conversation breakdowns and error handling. Traditional methods of collecting user experiences-usage logs and post-hoc interviews-do not fully capture the intricacies of older adults' interactions with VAs, particularly regarding their reactions to errors. To bridge this gap, we equipped 15 older adults' homes with Amazon smart speakers integrated with custom audio recorders to collect ``in-the-wild'' audio interaction data for detailed error analysis. Recognizing the conversational limitations of current VAs, our study also explored the capabilities of <b>Large</b> <b>Language</b> <b>Models</b> <b>(LLMs)</b> to handle natural and imperfect text for improving VAs. Midway through our study, we deployed <b>ChatGPT-powered</b> Alexa skill to investigate its efficacy for older adults. Our research suggests leveraging vocal and verbal responses combined with <b>LLMs'</b> contextual capabilities for enhanced error prevention and management in VAs, while proposing design considerations to align VA capabilities with older adults' expectations.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recent developments in <b>prompt-based</b> <b>generative</b> <b>AI</b> has given rise to discourse surrounding the perceived ethical concerns, economic implications, and consequences for the future of cultural production. As <b>generative</b> <b>imagery</b> becomes pervasive in mainstream society, dominated primarily by emerging industry leaders, we encourage that the role of the CHI community be one of inquiry; to investigate the numerous ways in which <b>generative</b> <b>AI</b> has the potential to, and already is, augmenting human creativity. In this paper, we conducted a diffractive analysis exploring the potential role of <b>prompt-based</b> interfaces in artists' creative practice. Over a two week period, seven visual artists were given access to a personalised instance of Stable Diffusion, <b>fine-tuned</b> on a dataset of their work. In the following diffractive analysis, we identified two dominant modes adopted by participants, AI for ideation, and AI for production. We furthermore present a number of ethical design considerations for the future development of <b>generative</b> <b>AI</b> interfaces.

**ABSTRACT**  
AI approaches are progressing besting humans at game-related tasks (e.g. chess). The next stage is expected to be Human-AI collaboration; however, the research on this subject has been mixed and is in need of additional data points. We add to this nascent literature by studying Human-AI collaboration on a common administrative educational task. Education is a special domain in its relation to AI and has been slow to adopt AI approaches in practice, concerned with the educational enterprise losing its humanistic touch and because standard of quality is demanded because of the impact on a person's career and developmental trajectory. In this study (N = 22), we design an experiment to explore the effect of Human-AI collaboration on the task of tagging educational content with skills from the US common core taxonomy. Our results show that the experiment group (with AI <b>recommendations)</b> saved around 50% time (p < 0.01) in the execution of their tagging task but at the sacrifice of 7.7% recall (p = 0.267) and 35% accuracy (p= 0.1170) compared with the non-AI involved control group, placing the AI+human group in between the AI alone (lowest performance) and the human alone (highest performance). We further analyze log data from this AI collaboration experiment to explore under what circumstances humans still exercised their discernment when receiving <b>recommendations.</b> Finally, we outline how this study can assist in implementing AI tools, like <b>ChatGPT,</b> in education.

**ABSTRACT**  
People have to remember an ever-expanding volume of information. Wearables that use information capture and retrieval for memory augmentation can help but can be disruptive and cumbersome in real-world tasks, such as in social settings. To address this, we developed Memoro, a wearable audio-based memory assistant with a concise user interface. Memoro uses a <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>model</b> <b>(LLM)</b> to infer the user's memory needs in a conversational context, semantically search memories, and present minimal suggestions. The assistant has two interaction modes: Query Mode for voicing queries and Queryless Mode for on-demand predictive assistance, without explicit query. Our study of (N=20) participants engaged in a real-time conversation demonstrated that using Memoro reduced device interaction time and increased recall confidence while preserving conversational quality. We report quantitative results and discuss the preferences and experiences of users. This work contributes towards utilizing <b>LLMs</b> to design wearable memory augmentation systems that are minimally disruptive.

**ABSTRACT**  
Programming assistants have reshaped the experience of programming into one where programmers spend less time writing and more time critically examining code. In this paper, we explore how programming assistants can be extended to accelerate the inspection of generated code. We introduce an extension to the programming assistant called Ivie, or instantly visible in-situ explanations. When using Ivie, a programmer's generated code is instantly accompanied by explanations positioned just adjacent to the code. Our design was optimized for extremely low-cost invocation and dismissal. Explanations are compact and informative. They describe meaningful expressions, from individual variables to entire blocks of code. We present an implementation of Ivie that forks VS Code, applying a modern <b>LLM</b> for timely segmentation and explanation of generated code. In a lab study, we compared Ivie to a contemporary baseline tool for code understanding. Ivie improved understanding of generated code, and was received by programmers as a highly useful, low distraction, desirable complement to the programming assistant.

**ABSTRACT**  
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly employed in various decision-making tasks, typically as a Recommender, providing <b>recommendations</b> that the AI deems correct. However, recent studies suggest this may diminish human analytical thinking and lead to humans' inappropriate reliance on AI, impairing the synergy in human-AI teams. In contrast, human advisors in group decision-making perform various roles, such as analyzing alternative options or criticizing decision-makers to encourage their critical thinking. This diversity of roles has not yet been empirically explored in AI assistance. In this paper, we examine three AI roles: Recommender, Analyzer, and Devil's Advocate, and evaluate their effects across two AI performance levels. Our results show each role's distinct strengths and limitations in task performance, reliance appropriateness, and user experience. Notably, the Recommender role is not always the most effective, especially if the AI performance level is low, the Analyzer role may be preferable. These insights offer valuable implications for designing AI assistants with adaptive functional roles according to different situations.

**ABSTRACT**  
Data annotation interfaces predominantly leverage ground truth labels to guide annotators toward accurate responses. With the growing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in domain-specific professional tasks, it has become increasingly important to help beginning annotators identify how their early-stage knowledge can lead to inaccurate answers, which in turn, helps to ensure quality annotations at scale. To investigate this issue, we conducted a formative study involving eight individuals from the field of disaster management, each possessing varying levels of expertise. The goal was to understand the prevalent factors contributing to disagreements among annotators when classifying Twitter messages related to disasters and to analyze their respective responses. Our analysis identified two primary causes of disagreement between expert and beginner annotators: 1) a lack of contextual knowledge or uncertainty about the situation, and 2) the absence of visual or supplementary cues. Based on these findings, we designed a Context interface, which generates aids that help beginners identify potential mistakes and provide the hidden context of the presented tweet. The summative study compares Context design with two widely used designs in data annotation UI, Highlight and <b>Reasoning-based</b> interfaces. We found significant differences between these designs in terms of attitudinal and behavioral data. We conclude with implications for designing future interfaces aiming at closing the knowledge gap among annotators.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Emotion</b> <b>datasets</b> used for Speech <b>Emotion</b> <b>Recognition</b> (SER) often contain acted or elicited speech, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. In this work, we used the <b>Emotional</b> <b>Voice</b> Messages (EMOVOME) database, including spontaneous voice messages from conversations of 100 Spanish speakers on a messaging app, labeled in continuous and discrete <b>emotions</b> <b>by</b> expert and non-expert annotators. We created speaker-independent SER models using the eGeMAPS features, <b>transformer-based</b> models and their combination. We compared the results with reference databases and analyzed the influence of annotators and gender <b>fairness.</b> The pre-trained Unispeech-L model and its combination with eGeMAPS achieved the highest results, with 61.64% and 55.57% Unweighted Accuracy (UA) for 3-class valence and arousal prediction respectively, a 10% improvement over baseline models. For the <b>emotion</b> <b>categories,</b> 42.58% UA was obtained. EMOVOME performed lower than the acted RAVDESS database. The elicited IEMOCAP database also outperformed EMOVOME in the prediction of <b>emotion</b> <b>categories,</b> while similar results were obtained in valence and arousal. Additionally, EMOVOME outcomes varied with annotator labels, showing superior results and better <b>fairness</b> when combining expert and non-expert annotations. This study significantly contributes to the evaluation of SER models in real-life situations, advancing in the development of applications for analyzing spontaneous voice messages.

**ABSTRACT**  
The advancement of Parkinson's Disease (PD) diagnosis through speech analysis is hindered by a notable lack of publicly available, diverse language datasets, limiting the reproducibility and further exploration of existing research. In response to this gap, we introduce a comprehensive corpus from 108 native Castilian Spanish speakers, comprising 55 healthy controls and 53 individuals diagnosed with PD, all of whom were under pharmacological treatment and recorded in their medication-optimized state. This unique dataset features a wide array of speech tasks, including sustained phonation of the five Spanish vowels, diadochokinetic tests, 16 listen-and-repeat utterances, and free monologues. The dataset emphasizes accuracy and reliability through specialist manual transcriptions of the listen-and-repeat tasks and utilizes Whisper for automated monologue transcriptions, making it the most complete public corpus of Parkinsonian speech, and the first in Castillian Spanish. NeuroVoz is composed by 2,903 audio recordings averaging $26.88 \pm 3.35$ recordings per participant, offering a substantial resource for the scientific exploration of PD's impact on speech. This dataset has already underpinned several studies, achieving a <b>benchmark</b> accuracy of 89% in PD speech pattern identification, indicating marked speech alterations attributable to PD. Despite these advances, the broader challenge of conducting a language-agnostic, cross-corpora analysis of Parkinsonian speech patterns remains an open area for future research. This contribution not only fills a critical void in PD speech analysis resources but also sets a new standard for the global research community in leveraging speech as a diagnostic tool for neurodegenerative diseases.

**ABSTRACT**  
We aim to perform sound event localization and detection (SELD) using wearable equipment for a moving human, such as a pedestrian. Conventional SELD tasks have dealt only with microphone arrays located in static positions. However, self-motion with three rotational and three translational degrees of freedom (6DoF) shall be considered for wearable microphone arrays. A system trained only with a dataset using microphone arrays in a fixed position would be unable to adapt to the fast relative motion of sound events associated with self-motion, resulting in the degradation of SELD performance. To address this, we designed 6DoF SELD Dataset for wearable systems, the first SELD dataset considering the self-motion of microphones. Furthermore, we proposed a <b>multi-modal</b> SELD system that jointly utilizes audio and motion tracking sensor signals. These sensor signals are expected to help the system find useful acoustic cues for SELD on the basis of the current self-motion state. Experimental results on our dataset show that the proposed method effectively improves SELD performance with a mechanism to extract acoustic features conditioned by sensor signals.

**ABSTRACT**  
Injecting heavy-tailed noise to the iterates of <b>stochastic</b> <b>gradient</b> <b>descent</b> <b>(SGD)</b> has received increasing attention over the past few years. While various theoretical properties of the resulting algorithm have been analyzed mainly from learning theory and optimization perspectives, their privacy preservation properties have not yet been established. Aiming to bridge this gap, we provide <b>differential</b> <b>privacy</b> (DP) guarantees for noisy <b>SGD,</b> when the injected noise follows an $\alpha$-stable distribution, which includes a spectrum of heavy-tailed distributions (with infinite variance) as well as the Gaussian distribution. Considering the $(\epsilon, \delta)$-DP framework, we show that <b>SGD</b> with heavy-tailed perturbations achieves $(0, \tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/n))$-DP for a broad class of loss functions which can be non-convex, where $n$ is the number of data points. As a remarkable byproduct, contrary to prior work that necessitates bounded sensitivity for the gradients or clipping the iterates, our theory reveals that under mild assumptions, such a projection step is not actually necessary. We illustrate that the heavy-tailed noising mechanism achieves similar DP guarantees compared to the Gaussian case, which suggests that it can be a viable alternative to its light-tailed counterparts.

**ABSTRACT**  
Schr\"{o}dinger bridge can be viewed as a <b>continuous-time</b> <b>stochastic</b> control problem where the goal is to find an optimally controlled <b>diffusion</b> <b>process</b> with a pre-specified terminal distribution $\mu_T$. We propose to generalize this stochastic control problem by allowing the terminal distribution to differ from $\mu_T$ but penalizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the two distributions. We call this new control problem soft-constrained Schr\"{o}dinger bridge (SSB). The main contribution of this work is a theoretical derivation of the solution to SSB, which shows that the terminal distribution of the optimally controlled process is a geometric mixture of $\mu_T$ and some other distribution. This result is further extended to a time series setting. One application of SSB is the development of robust generative <b>diffusion</b> <b>models.</b> We propose a score matching-based algorithm for sampling from geometric mixtures and showcase its use via a numerical example for the <b>MNIST</b> data set.

**ABSTRACT**  
We propose a method to represent bipartite networks using <b>graph</b> <b>embeddings</b> tailored to tackle the challenges of studying ecological networks, such as the ones linking plants and pollinators, where many covariates need to be accounted for, in particular to control for sampling bias. We adapt the variational <b>graph</b> <b>auto-encoder</b> approach to the bipartite case, which enables us to generate embeddings in a latent space where the two sets of nodes are positioned based on their probability of connection. We translate the <b>fairness</b> framework commonly considered in sociology in order to address sampling bias in ecology. By incorporating the Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC) as an additional penalty term in the loss we optimize, we ensure that the structure of the latent space is independent of continuous variables, which are related to the sampling process. Finally, we show how our approach can change our understanding of ecological networks when applied to the Spipoll data set, a citizen science monitoring program of plant-pollinator interactions to which many observers contribute, making it prone to sampling bias.

**ABSTRACT**  
We introduce a causal regularisation extension to anchor regression (AR) for improved <b>out-of-distribution</b> (OOD) generalisation. We present anchor-compatible losses, aligning with the anchor framework to ensure robustness against <b>distribution</b> <b>shifts.</b> Various multivariate analysis (MVA) algorithms, such as (Orthonormalized) PLS, RRR, and MLR, fall within the anchor framework. We observe that simple regularisation enhances robustness in OOD settings. Estimators for selected algorithms are provided, showcasing consistency and efficacy in synthetic and real-world climate science problems. The empirical validation highlights the versatility of anchor regularisation, emphasizing its compatibility with MVA approaches and its role in enhancing replicability while guarding against <b>distribution</b> <b>shifts.</b> The extended AR framework advances causal inference methodologies, addressing the need for reliable OOD generalisation.

**ABSTRACT**  
Identifying errors in parallel MPI programs is a challenging task. Despite the growing number of verification tools, debugging parallel programs remains a significant challenge. This paper is the first to utilize embedding and deep learning <b>graph</b> <b>neural</b> <b>networks</b> <b>(GNNs)</b> to tackle the issue of identifying bugs in MPI programs. Specifically, we have designed and developed two models that can determine, from a code's LLVM Intermediate Representation (IR), whether the code is correct or contains a known MPI error. We tested our models using two dedicated MPI <b>benchmark</b> suites for verification: MBI and MPI-CorrBench. By training and validating our models on the same <b>benchmark</b> suite, we achieved a prediction accuracy of 92% in detecting error types. Additionally, we trained and evaluated our models on distinct <b>benchmark</b> suites (e.g., transitioning from MBI to MPI-CorrBench) and achieved a promising accuracy of over 80%. Finally, we investigated the interaction between different MPI errors and quantified our models' generalization capabilities over new unseen errors. This involved removing error types during training and assessing whether our models could still predict them. The detection accuracy of removed errors varies significantly between 20% to 80%, indicating connected error patterns.

**ABSTRACT**  
Distributed <b>LLM</b> serving is costly and often underutilizes hardware accelerators due to three key challenges: bubbles in pipeline-parallel deployments caused by the bimodal latency of <b>prompt</b> and token processing, GPU memory overprovisioning, and long recovery times in case of failures. In this paper, we propose D\'ej\`aVu, a system to address all these challenges using a versatile and efficient KV cache streaming library (D\'ej\`aVuLib). Using D\'ej\`aVuLib, we propose and implement efficient <b>prompt-token</b> disaggregation to reduce pipeline bubbles, microbatch swapping for efficient GPU memory management, and state replication for fault-tolerance. We highlight the efficacy of these solutions on a range of large models across cloud deployments.

**ABSTRACT**  
Distributed Stream Processing (DSP) systems are capable of processing large streams of unbounded data, offering high throughput and low latencies. To maintain a stable Quality of Service (QoS), these systems require a sufficient allocation of resources. At the same time, over-provisioning can result in wasted energy and high operating costs. Therefore, to maximize resource utilization, autoscaling methods have been proposed that aim to efficiently match the resource allocation with the incoming workload. However, determining when and by how much to scale remains a significant challenge. Given the long-running nature of DSP jobs, scaling actions need to be executed at runtime, and to maintain a good QoS, they should be both accurate and infrequent. To address the challenges of autoscaling, the concept of self-adaptive systems is particularly fitting. These systems monitor themselves and their environment, adapting to changes with minimal need for expert involvement. This paper introduces Daedalus, a self-adaptive manager for autoscaling in DSP systems, which draws on the principles of <b>self-adaption</b> to address the challenge of efficient autoscaling. Daedalus monitors a running DSP job and builds performance models, aiming to predict the maximum processing capacity at different scale-outs. When combined with time series forecasting to predict future workloads, Daedalus proactively scales DSP jobs, optimizing for maximum throughput and minimizing both latencies and resource usage. We conducted experiments using Apache Flink and Kafka Streams to evaluate the performance of Daedalus against two state-of-the-art approaches. Daedalus was able to achieve comparable latencies while reducing resource usage by up to 71%.

**ABSTRACT**  
Distributed Stream Processing (DSP) focuses on the near real-time processing of large streams of unbounded data. To increase processing capacities, DSP systems are able to dynamically scale across a cluster of commodity nodes, ensuring a good Quality of Service despite variable workloads. However, selecting scaleout configurations which maximize resource utilization remains a challenge. This is especially true in environments where workloads change over time and node failures are all but inevitable. Furthermore, configuration parameters such as memory allocation and checkpointing intervals impact performance and resource usage as well. Sub-optimal configurations easily lead to high operational costs, poor performance, or unacceptable loss of service. In this paper, we present Demeter, a method for dynamically optimizing key DSP system configuration parameters for resource efficiency. Demeter uses Time Series Forecasting to predict future workloads and Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization to model runtime behaviors in relation to parameter settings and workload rates. Together, these techniques allow us to determine whether or not enough is known about the predicted workload rate to proactively initiate short-lived parallel profiling runs for data gathering. Once trained, the models guide the adjustment of multiple, potentially dependent system configuration parameters ensuring optimized performance and resource usage in response to changing workload rates. Our experiments on a commodity cluster using Apache Flink demonstrate that Demeter significantly improves the operational efficiency of long-running <b>benchmark</b> jobs.

**ABSTRACT**  
Context: Edge <b>graphs</b> are <b>graphs</b> whose edges are labelled with identifiers, and nodes can have multiple edges between them. They are used to model a wide range of systems, including networks with distances or degrees of connection and complex relational data. Inquiry: Unfortunately, the homogeneity of this <b>graph</b> structure prevents an effective representation in (functional) programs. Either their interface is riddled with partial functions, or the representations are computationally inefficient to process. Approach: We present a novel data type for edge <b>graphs,</b> based on total and recursive definitions, that prevents usage errors from partial APIs and promotes structurally recursive computations. We follow an algebraic approach and provide a set of primitive constructors and combinators, along with equational laws that identify semantically equivalent constructions. Knowledge: This algebra translates directly into an implementation using algebraic data types, and its homomorphisms give rise to functions for manipulating and transforming these edge <b>graphs.</b> <b>Grounding:</b> We exploit the fact that many common <b>graph</b> algorithms are such homomorphisms to implement them in our framework. Importance: In giving a theoretical <b>grounding</b> for the edge <b>graph</b> data type, we can formalise properties such as soundness and completeness of the representation while also minimising usage errors and maximising re-usability.

**ABSTRACT**  
Context: Roblox Studio lets millions of creators build interactive experiences by programming in a variant of Lua called Luau. The creators form a broad group, ranging from novices writing their first script to professional developers; thus, Luau must support a wide audience. As part of its efforts to support all kinds of programmers, Luau includes an optional, gradual type system and goes to great lengths to minimize false positive errors. Inquiry: Since Luau is currently being used by many creators, we want to collect data to improve the language and, in particular, the type system. The standard way to collect data is to deploy client-side telemetry; however, we cannot scrape personal data or proprietary information, which means we cannot collect source code fragments, error messages, or even filepaths. The research questions are thus about how to conduct telemetry that is not invasive and obtain insights from it about type errors. Approach: We designed and implemented a pseudonymized, randomly-sampling telemetry system for Luau. Telemetry records include a timestamp, a session id, a reason for sending, and a numeric summary of the most recent type analyses. This information lets us study type errors over time without revealing private data. We deployed the system in Roblox Studio during Spring 2023 and collected over 1.5 million telemetry records from over 340,000 sessions. Knowledge: We present several findings about Luau, all of which suggest that telemetry is an effective way to study type error pragmatics. One of the less-surprising findings is that opt-in gradual types are unpopular: there is an 100x gap between the number of untyped Luau sessions and the number of typed ones. One surprise is that the strict mode for type analysis is overly conservative about interactions with data assets. A reassuring finding is that type analysis rarely hits its internal limits on problem size. <b>Grounding:</b> Our findings are supported by a dataset of over 1.5 million telemetry records. The data and scripts for analyzing it are available in an artifact. Importance: Beyond the immediate benefits to Luau, our findings about types and type errors have implications for adoption and ergonomics in other gradual languages such as TypeScript, Elixir, and Typed Racket. Our telemetry design is of broad interest, as it reports on type errors without revealing sensitive information.

**ABSTRACT**  
Context: Reactive programming (RP) is a declarative programming paradigm suitable for expressing the handling of events. It enables programmers to create applications that react automatically to changes over time. Whenever a time-varying signal changes -- e.g. in response to values produced by event stream (e.g., sensor data, user input...) -- the program state is updated automatically in tandem with that change. This makes RP well-suited for building interactive applications and reactive (soft real-time) systems. Inquiry: RP Language implementations are often built on top of an existing (host) language as an Embedded Domain Specific Language (EDSL). This results in application code in which reactive code and non-reactive code is inherently entangled. Using a mechanism known as lifting, one usually has access to the full feature set of the (non-reactive) host language in the RP program. However, lifting is also dangerous. First, host code expressed in a Turing-complete language may diverge, resulting in unresponsive programs: i.e. reactive programs that are not actually reactive. Second, the bi-directional integration of reactive and non-reactive code results in a paradigmatic mismatch that, when unchecked, leads to faulty behaviour in programs. Approach: We propose a new reactive programming language, that has been meticulously designed to be reactive-only. We start with a simple (first-order) model for reactivity, based on reactors (i.e. uninstantiated descriptions of signals and their dependencies) and deployments (i.e. instances of reactors) that consist of signals. The language does not have the notion of functions, and thus unlike other RP languages there is no lifting either. We extend this simple model incrementally with additional features found in other programming languages, RP or otherwise. These features include stateful reactors (that allow for time-based accumulation), signals with dynamic dependencies by means of conditionals and polymorphic deployments, recursively-defined reactors, and (anonymous) reactors with lexical scope. Knowledge: In our description of these language features, we not only describe the syntax and semantics, but also how each features compares to the problems that exist in (EDSL) RP languages. I.e. by starting from a reactive-only model, we identify which reactive features (that, in other RP languages are typically expressed in non-reactive code) affect the reactive guarantees that can be enforced by the language. <b>Grounding:</b> We base our arguments by analysing the effect that each feature has on our language: e.g., by analysing how signals are updated, how they are created and how dependencies between signals can be affected. When applicable, we draw parallels with other languages: i.e. similarities shared with other RP languages will be highlighted and thoroughly analysed, and where relevant the same will also be done with non-reactive languages. Importance: Our language shows how a purely reactive programming is able to express the same kinds of programs as in other RP languages that require the use of (unchecked) functions. By considering reactive programs as a collection of pure (reactive-only) reactors, we aim to increase how reactive programming is comprehended by both language designers and its users.

**ABSTRACT**  
The growing concern for energy efficiency in the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) sector has <b>prompted</b> the exploration of resource management techniques. While hardware architectures, such as single-ISA asymmetric multicore processors (AMP), offer potential energy savings, there is still untapped potential for software optimizations. This paper aims to bridge this gap by investigating the scheduling of garbage collection (GC) activities on a heterogeneous architecture with both performance cores ("p-cores") and energy cores ("e-cores") to achieve energy savings. Our study focuses on the concurrent ZGC collector in the context of Java Virtual Machines (JVM), as the energy aspect is not well studied in the context of latency-sensitive Java workloads. By comparing the energy efficiency, performance, latency, and memory utilization of executing GC on p-cores versus e-cores, we present compelling findings. We demonstrate that scheduling GC work on e-cores overall leads to approximately 3% energy savings without performance and mean latency degradation while requiring no additional effort from developers. Overall energy reduction can increase to 5.3$\pm$0.0225% by tuning the number of e-cores (still not changing the program!). Our findings highlight the practicality and benefits of scheduling GC on e-cores, showcasing the potential for energy savings in heterogeneous architectures running Java workloads while meeting critical latency requirements. Our research contributes to the ongoing efforts toward achieving a more sustainable and efficient ICT sector.

**ABSTRACT**  
Context: In the first part of his 2012 presentation "Inventing on Principle", Bret Victor gives a demo of a live code editor for Javascript which shows the dynamic history of values of variables in real time. This form of live programming has become known as "probes". Probes provide the programmer with permanent and continuous insight into the dynamic evolution of function or method variables, thus improving feedback and developer experience. Inquiry: Although Victor shows a working prototype of live probes in the context of Javascript, he does not discuss strategies for implementing them. Later work provides an implementation approach, but this requires a programming language to be implemented on top of the GraalVM runtime. In this paper we present **LiveRec**, a generic approach for implementing probes which can be applied in the context of many programming languages, without requiring the modification of compilers or run-time systems. Approach: **LiveRec** is based on reusing existing debug protocols to implement probes. Methods or functions are compiled after every code change and executed inside the debugger. During execution the evolution of all local variables in the current stack frame are recorded and communicated back to the editor or IDE for display to the user. Knowledge: It turns out that mainstream debug protocols are rich enough for implementing live probes. Step-wise execution, code hot swapping, and stack frame inspection provide the right granularity and sufficient information to realize live probes, without modifying compilers or language runtimes. Furthermore, it turns out that the recently proposed Debugger Adapter Protocol (DAP) provides an even more generic approach of implementing live probes, but, in some cases, at the cost of a significant performance penalty. <b>Grounding:</b> We have applied **LiveRec** to implement probes using stack recording natively for Java through the Java Debug Interface (JDI), and through the DAP for Java, Python, C, and Javascript, all requiring just modest amounts of configuration code. We evaluate the run-time performance of all four probes prototypes, decomposed into: compile-after-change, hot swap, single step overhead, and stack recording overhead. Our initial results show that live probes on top of native debug APIs can be performant enough for interactive use. In the case of DAP, however, it highly depends on characteristics of the programming language implementation and its associated debugging infrastructure. Importance: Live programming improves the programmer experience by providing immediate feedback about a program's execution and eliminating disruptive edit-compile-restart sequences. Probes are one way to shorten the programmer feedback loop at the level of functions and methods. Although probes are not new, and have been implemented in (prototype) systems, **LiveRec**'s approach of building live probes on top of existing and generic debug protocols promises a path towards probes for a host of mainstream programming languages, with reasonable effort.

**ABSTRACT**  
The array is a data structure used in a wide range of programs. Its compact storage and constant time random access makes it highly efficient, but arbitrary indexing complicates the analysis of code containing array accesses. Such analyses are important for compiler optimisations such as bounds check elimination. The aim of this work is to gain a better understanding of how arrays are used in real-world programs. While previous work has applied static analyses to understand how arrays are accessed and used, we take a dynamic approach. We empirically examine various characteristics of array usage by instrumenting programs to log all array accesses, allowing for analysis of array sizes, element types, from where arrays are accessed and to which extent sequences of array accesses form recognizable patterns. The programs in the study were collected from the Renaissance <b>benchmark</b> suite, all running on the Java Virtual Machine. We account for characteristics displayed by the arrays investigated, finding that most arrays have a small size, are accessed by only one or two classes and by a single thread. On average over the <b>benchmarks,</b> 69.8% of the access patterns consist of uncomplicated traversals. Most of the instrumented classes (over 95%) do not use arrays directly at all. These results come from tracing data covering 3,803,043,390 array accesses made across 168,686 classes. While our analysis has only been applied to the Renaissance <b>benchmark</b> suite, the methodology can be applied to any program running on the Java Virtual Machine. This study, and the methodology in general, can inform future runtime implementations and compiler optimisations.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this paper, we propose a multilayer inhomogeneous random <b>graph</b> model (MIRG), whose layers may consist of both single-edge and multi-edge <b>graphs.</b> In the single layer case, it has been shown that the regular variation of the weight distribution underlying the inhomogeneous random <b>graph</b> implies the regular variation of the typical degree distribution. We extend this correspondence to the multilayer case by showing that the multivariate regular variation of the weight distribution implies the multivariate regular variation of the asymptotic degree distribution. Furthermore, in certain circumstances, the extremal dependence structure present in the weight distribution will be adopted by the asymptotic degree distribution. By considering the asymptotic degree distribution, a wider class of Chung-Lu and Norros-Reittu <b>graphs</b> may be incorporated into the MIRG layers. Additionally, we prove consistency of the Hill estimator when applied to degrees of the MIRG that have a tail index greater than 1. <b>Simulation</b> results indicate that, in practice, hidden regular variation may be consistently detected from an observed MIRG.

**ABSTRACT**  
Scientific discoveries often hinge on synthesizing decades of research, a task that potentially outstrips human information processing capacities. <b>Large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> <b>(LLMs)</b> offer a solution. <b>LLMs</b> trained on the vast scientific literature could potentially integrate noisy yet interrelated findings to forecast novel results better than human experts. To evaluate this possibility, we created BrainBench, a forward-looking <b>benchmark</b> for predicting neuroscience results. We find that <b>LLMs</b> surpass experts in predicting experimental outcomes. BrainGPT, an <b>LLM</b> we tuned on the neuroscience literature, performed better yet. Like human experts, when <b>LLMs</b> were confident in their predictions, they were more likely to be correct, which presages a future where humans and <b>LLMs</b> team together to make discoveries. Our approach is not neuroscience-specific and is transferable to other knowledge-intensive endeavors.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this paper, a thermodynamically consistent solution of the interfacial Riemann problem for the first-order hyperbolic continuum model of Godunov, Peshkov and Romenski (GPR model) is presented. In the presence of phase transition, interfacial physics are governed by molecular interaction on a microscopic scale, beyond the scope of the macroscopic continuum model in the bulk phases. The developed two-phase Riemann solvers tackle this multi-scale problem, by incorporating a local thermodynamic model to predict the interfacial entropy production. Using phenomenological relations of non-equilibrium thermodynamics, interfacial mass and heat fluxes are derived from the entropy production and provide closure at the phase boundary. We employ the proposed Riemann solvers in an efficient sharp interface level-set Ghost-Fluid framework to provide coupling conditions at phase interfaces under phase transition. As a single-phase <b>benchmark,</b> a Rayleigh-B\'enard convection is studied to compare the hyperbolic thermal relaxation formulation of the GPR model against the hyperbolic-parabolic Euler-Fourier system. The novel interfacial Riemann solvers are validated against molecular dynamics <b>simulations</b> of evaporating shock tubes with the Lennard-Jones shifted and truncated potential. On a macroscopic scale, evaporating shock tubes are computed for the material n-Dodecane and compared against Euler-Fourier results. Finally, the efficiency and robustness of the scheme is demonstrated with shock-droplet interaction <b>simulations</b> that involve both phase transfer and surface tension, while featuring severe interface deformations.

**ABSTRACT**  
We use backward error analysis for differential equations to obtain modified or distorted equations describing the behaviour of the Newmark scheme applied to the transient structural dynamics equation. Using these results, we show how to construct compensation terms from the original parameters of the system, which improve the performance of Newmark <b>simulations</b> without changing the time step or modifying the scheme itself. Two such compensations are given: one eliminates numerical damping, while the other achieves fourth-order accurate calculations using the traditionally second-order Newmark method.

**ABSTRACT**  
For the <b>simulation-based</b> design of fiber melt spinning processes, the accurate modeling of the processed polymer with regard to its material behavior is crucial. In this work, we develop a high-speed elongational rheometer for Carreau-type materials, making use of process <b>simulations</b> and fiber diameter measurements. The procedure is based on a unified formulation of the fiber spinning model for all material types (Newtonian and non-Newtonian), whose material laws are strictly monotone in the strain rate. The parametrically described material law for the elongational viscosity implies a nonlinear optimization problem for the parameter identification, for which we propose an efficient, robust gradient-based method. The work can be understood as a proof of concept, a generalization to other, more complex materials is possible.

**ABSTRACT**  
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) <b>simulations</b> have been widely used to generate samples from the complex posterior distribution in Bayesian inferences. However, these <b>simulations</b> often require multiple computations of the forward model in the likelihood function for each drawn sample. This computational burden renders MCMC sampling impractical when the forward model is computationally expensive, such as in the case of partial differential equation models. In this paper, we propose a novel sampling approach called the geometric optics approximation method (GOAM) for Bayesian inverse problems, which entirely circumvents the need for MCMC <b>simulations.</b> Our method is rooted in the problem of reflector shape design, which focuses on constructing a reflecting surface that redirects rays from a source, with a predetermined density, towards a target domain while achieving a desired density distribution. The key idea is to consider the unnormalized Bayesian posterior as the density on the target domain within the optical system and define a geometric optics approximation measure with respect to posterior by a reflecting surface. Consequently, once such a reflecting surface is obtained, we can utilize it to draw an arbitrary number of independent and uncorrelated samples from the posterior measure for Bayesian inverse problems. In theory, we have shown that the geometric optics approximation measure is well-posed. The efficiency and robustness of our proposed sampler, employing the geometric optics approximation method, are demonstrated through several numerical examples provided in this paper.

**ABSTRACT**  
We present novel improvements in the context of symbol-based multigrid procedures for solving large block structured linear systems. We study the application of an aggregation-based grid transfer operator that transforms the symbol of a block Toeplitz matrix from matrix-valued to scalar-valued at the coarser level. Our convergence analysis of the Two-Grid Method (TGM) reveals the connection between the features of the scalar-valued symbol at the coarser level and the properties of the original matrix-valued one. This allows us to prove the convergence of a V-cycle multigrid with standard grid transfer operators for scalar Toeplitz systems at the coarser levels. Consequently, we extend the class of suitable smoothers for block Toeplitz matrices, focusing on the efficiency of block strategies, particularly the relaxed block Jacobi method. General conditions on smoothing parameters are derived, with emphasis on practical applications where these parameters can be calculated with negligible computational cost. We test the proposed strategies on linear systems <b>stemming</b> from the discretization of differential problems with $\mathbb{Q}_{d} $ Lagrangian FEM or B-spline with non-maximal regularity. The numerical results show in both cases computational advantages compared to existing methods for block structured linear systems.

**ABSTRACT**  
Urban rail transit is a fundamental component of public transportation, however, commonly station-based path search algorithms often overlook the impact of transfer times on search results, leading to decreased accuracy. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a novel shortest path query algorithm based on adaptive topology optimization called the Adaptive Topology Extension Road Network Structure (ATEN). This algorithm categorizes transfer stations into different types and treats travel time and transfer time equivalently as weights for edges in the topological <b>graph.</b> The proposed algorithm introduces virtual stations to differentiate between pedestrian paths and train paths, eliminating the need for additional operations on transfer stations. The algorithm controls the extent of expansion in the urban rail transit topology, overcoming query errors caused by mishandling of transfer stations in the existing algorithm. Finally, a series of <b>simulation</b> experiments were conducted on Beijing's urban rail transit network to validate both correctness and efficiency of the proposed adaptive topology optimization algorithm. The results demonstrate significant advantages compared to existing similar algorithms.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper presents a novel approach for estimating the Koopman operator defined on a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and its spectra. We propose an estimation method, what we call Jet Dynamic Mode Decomposition (JetDMD), leveraging the intrinsic structure of RKHS and the geometric notion known as jets to enhance the estimation of the Koopman operator. This method refines the traditional Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD) in accuracy, especially in the numerical estimation of eigenvalues. This paper proves JetDMD's superiority through explicit error bounds and convergence rate for special positive definite kernels, offering a solid theoretical foundation for its performance. We also delve into the spectral analysis of the Koopman operator, proposing the notion of extended Koopman operator within a framework of rigged Hilbert space. This notion leads to a deeper understanding of estimated Koopman eigenfunctions and capturing them outside the original function space. Through the theory of rigged Hilbert space, our study provides a principled methodology to analyze the estimated spectrum and eigenfunctions of Koopman operators, and enables eigendecomposition within a rigged RKHS. We also propose a new effective method for reconstructing the dynamical system from temporally-sampled trajectory data of the dynamical system with solid theoretical guarantee. We conduct several numerical <b>simulations</b> using the van der Pol oscillator, the Duffing oscillator, the H\'enon map, and the Lorenz attractor, and illustrate the performance of JetDMD with clear numerical computations of eigenvalues and accurate predictions of the dynamical systems.

**ABSTRACT**  
Safety-critical failures often have fatal consequences in aerospace control. Control systems on aircraft, therefore, must ensure the strict satisfaction of safety constraints, preferably with formal guarantees of safe behavior. This paper establishes the safety-critical control of fixed-wing aircraft in collision avoidance and geofencing tasks. A control framework is developed wherein a run-time assurance (RTA) system modulates the nominal flight controller of the aircraft whenever necessary to prevent it from colliding with other aircraft or crossing a boundary (geofence) in space. The RTA is formulated as a safety filter using control barrier functions (CBFs) with formal guarantees of safe behavior. CBFs are constructed and compared for a nonlinear kinematic fixed-wing aircraft model. The proposed CBF-based controllers showcase the capability of safely executing simultaneous collision avoidance and geofencing, as demonstrated by <b>simulations</b> on the kinematic model and a high-fidelity dynamical model.

**ABSTRACT**  
In recent years, the dynamic factor model has emerged as a dominant tool in economics and finance, particularly for investment strategies. This model offers improved handling of complex, nonlinear, and noisy market conditions compared to traditional static factor models. The advancement of machine learning, especially in dealing with nonlinear data, has further enhanced asset pricing methodologies. This paper introduces a groundbreaking dynamic factor model named RVRAE. This model is a probabilistic approach that addresses the temporal dependencies and noise in market data. RVRAE ingeniously combines the principles of dynamic factor modeling with the variational recurrent <b>autoencoder</b> (VRAE) from deep learning. A key feature of RVRAE is its use of a prior-posterior learning method. This method <b>fine-tunes</b> the model's learning process by seeking an optimal posterior factor model informed by future data. Notably, RVRAE is adept at risk modeling in volatile stock markets, estimating variances from latent space distributions while also predicting returns. Our empirical tests with real stock market data underscore RVRAE's superior performance compared to various established baseline methods.

**ABSTRACT**  
Models of computations over the integers are equivalent from a computability and complexity theory point of view by the Church-Turing thesis. It is not possible to unify <b>discrete-time</b> <b>models</b> over the reals. The situation is unclear but simpler for <b>continuous-time</b> <b>models,</b> as there is a unifying mathematical model provided by ordinary differential equations (ODEs). For example, the GPAC model of Shannon is known to correspond to polynomial ODEs. However, the question of a robust complexity theory for such models and its relations to classical <b>(discrete)</b> <b>computation</b> theory is an old problem. There was some recent significant progress: it has been proved that (classical) time complexity corresponds to the length of the involved curves. The question of whether there is a simple and robust way to measure space complexity remains. We argue that space complexity corresponds to precision and conversely. We propose and prove an algebraic characterisation of FPSPACE, using <b>continuous</b> <b>ODEs.</b> Recent papers proposed algebraic characterisations of polynomial-time and -space complexity classes over the reals, but with a <b>discrete-time:</b> <b>those</b> algebras rely on <b>discrete</b> <b>ODE</b> schemes. Here, we use classical <b>(continuous)</b> <b>ODEs,</b> with the classic definition of derivation and hence with the more natural context of <b>continuous-time</b> <b>associated</b> with ODEs. We characterise both the case of polynomial space functions over the integers and the reals. We prove that Turing machines, with a proper representation of real numbers, can be simulated by <b>continuous</b> <b>ODEs</b> and not just <b>discrete</b> <b>ODEs.</b> A major consequence is that the associated space complexity is provably related to the numerical stability of involved schemas and the associated required precision. We obtain that a problem can be solved in polynomial space if and only if it can be simulated by some numerically stable ODE, using a polynomial precision.

In this paper, the existence, uniqueness, and positivity of solutions, as well as the asymptotic behavior through a finite fractal dimensional global attractor for a general Advection-Diffusion-Reaction (ADR) equation, are investigated. Our findings are innovative, as we employ semigroups and global attractors theories to achieve these results. Also, an analytical solution of a two-dimensional Advection-Diffusion Equation is presented. And finally, two Explicit Finite Difference schemes are used to simulate solutions in the two- and three-dimensional cases. The numerical <b>simulations</b> are conducted with predefined initial and Dirichlet boundary conditions.

**ABSTRACT**  
Evolutionary algorithms, such as Differential Evolution, excel in solving real-parameter optimization challenges. However, the effectiveness of a single algorithm varies across different problem instances, necessitating considerable efforts in algorithm selection or configuration. This paper aims to address the limitation by leveraging the complementary strengths of a group of algorithms and dynamically scheduling them throughout the optimization progress for specific problems. We propose a deep <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning-based</b> dynamic algorithm selection framework to accomplish this task. Our approach models the dynamic algorithm selection a <b>Markov</b> <b>Decision</b> <b>Process,</b> training an agent in a policy gradient manner to select the most suitable algorithm according to the features observed during the optimization process. To empower the agent with the necessary information, our framework incorporates a thoughtful design of landscape and algorithmic features. Meanwhile, we employ a sophisticated deep neural network model to infer the optimal action, ensuring informed algorithm selections. Additionally, an algorithm context restoration mechanism is embedded to facilitate smooth switching among different algorithms. These mechanisms together enable our framework to seamlessly select and switch algorithms in a dynamic online fashion. Notably, the proposed framework is simple and generic, offering potential improvements across a broad spectrum of evolutionary algorithms. As a proof-of-principle study, we apply this framework to a group of Differential Evolution algorithms. The experimental results showcase the remarkable effectiveness of the proposed framework, not only enhancing the overall optimization performance but also demonstrating favorable generalization ability across different problem classes.

**ABSTRACT**  
Approximation capability of reservoir systems whose reservoir is a <b>recurrent</b> <b>neural</b> <b>network</b> <b>(RNN)</b> is discussed. In our problem setting, a reservoir system approximates a set of functions just by adjusting its linear readout while the reservoir is fixed. We will show what we call uniform strong universality of a family of <b>RNN</b> reservoir systems for a certain class of functions to be approximated. This means that, for any positive number, we can construct a sufficiently large <b>RNN</b> reservoir system whose approximation error for each function in the class of functions to be approximated is bounded from above by the positive number. Such <b>RNN</b> reservoir systems are constructed via parallel concatenation of <b>RNN</b> reservoirs.

**ABSTRACT**  
Reservoir computing (RC) offers a neuromorphic framework that is particularly effective for processing spatiotemporal signals. Known for its temporal processing prowess, RC significantly lowers training costs compared to conventional <b>recurrent</b> <b>neural</b> <b>networks.</b> A key component in its hardware deployment is the ability to generate dynamic reservoir states. Our research introduces a novel dual-memory RC system, integrating a short-term memory via a WOx-based memristor, capable of achieving 16 distinct states encoded over 4 bits, and a long-term memory component using a TiOx-based memristor within the readout layer. We thoroughly examine both memristor types and leverage the RC system to process temporal data sets. The performance of the proposed RC system is validated through two <b>benchmark</b> tasks: isolated spoken digit recognition with incomplete inputs and Mackey-Glass time series prediction. The system delivered an impressive 98.84% accuracy in digit recognition and sustained a low normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) of 0.036 in the time series prediction task, underscoring its capability. This study illuminates the adeptness of memristor-based RC systems in managing intricate temporal challenges, laying the groundwork for further innovations in neuromorphic computing.

**ABSTRACT**  
The computational capabilities of dendrites have become increasingly clear. This letter presents the idea that neural backpropagation is using dendritic processing to enable individual neurons to perform autoencoding. Using a very simple connection weight search heuristic and artificial neural network model, the effects of interleaving autoencoding for each neuron in a hidden layer of a feedforward network are explored. This is contrasted to the standard layered approach to autoencoding. It is shown that such individualised processing is not detrimental and can improve network learning.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this paper, we investigate the performance of a Hybrid Quantum Neural Network (HQNN) and a comparable classical <b>Convolution</b> Neural Network <b>(CNN)</b> for detection and classification problem using a radar. Specifically, we take a fairly complex radar time-series model derived from electromagnetic theory, namely the Martin-Mulgrew model, that is used to simulate radar returns of objects with rotating blades, such as drones. We find that when that signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is high, <b>CNN</b> outperforms the HQNN for detection and classification. However, in the low SNR regime (which is of greatest interest in practice) the performance of HQNN is found to be superior to that of the <b>CNN</b> of a similar architecture.

**ABSTRACT**  
The potential impact of quantum machine learning algorithms on industrial applications remains an exciting open question. Conventional methods for encoding classical data into quantum computers are not only too costly for a potential quantum advantage in the algorithms but also severely limit the scale of feasible experiments on current hardware. Therefore, recent works, despite claiming the near-term suitability of their algorithms, do not provide experimental <b>benchmarking</b> on standard machine learning datasets. We attempt to solve the data encoding problem by improving a recently proposed variational algorithm [1] that approximately prepares the encoded data, using asymptotically shallow circuits that fit the native gate set and topology of currently available quantum computers. We apply the improved algorithm to encode the Fashion-MNIST dataset [2], which can be directly used in future empirical studies of quantum machine learning algorithms. We deploy simple quantum variational classifiers trained on the encoded dataset on a current quantum computer ibmq-kolkata [3] and achieve moderate accuracies, providing a proof of concept for the near-term usability of our data encoding method.

**ABSTRACT**  
We introduce PennyLane's Lightning suite, a collection of high-performance state-vector simulators targeting CPU, GPU, and HPC-native architectures and workloads. Quantum applications such as QAOA, VQE, and synthetic workloads are implemented to demonstrate the supported classical computing architectures and showcase the scale of problems that can be simulated using our tooling. We <b>benchmark</b> the performance of Lightning with backends supporting CPUs, as well as NVidia and AMD GPUs, and compare the results to other commonly used high-performance simulator packages, demonstrating where Lightning's implementations give performance leads. We show improved CPU performance by employing explicit SIMD intrinsics and multi-threading, batched task-based execution across multiple GPUs, and distributed forward and gradient-based quantum circuit executions across multiple nodes. Our data shows we can comfortably simulate a variety of circuits, giving examples with up to 30 qubits on a single device or node, and up to 41 qubits using multiple nodes.

**ABSTRACT**  
Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation, a delay-Doppler (DD) domain communication scheme exhibiting strong robustness against the Doppler shifts, has the potentials to be employed in LEO satellite communications. However, the performance comparison with the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation and the resource allocation scheme for multiuser OTFS-based LEO satellite communication system have rarely been investigated. In this paper, we conduct a performance comparison under various channel conditions between the OTFS and OFDM modulations, encompassing evaluations of sum-rate and bit error ratio (BER). Additionally, we investigate the joint optimal allocation of power and delay-Doppler resource blocks aiming at maximizing sum-rate for multiuser downlink OTFS-based LEO satellite communication systems. Unlike the conventional modulations relaying on complex input-output relations within the Time-Frequency (TF) domain, the OTFS modulation exploits both time and frequency diversities, i.e., delay and Doppler shifts remain constant during a OTFS frame, which facilitates a DD domain input-output simple relation for our investigation. We transform the resulting non-convex and combinatorial optimization problem into an equivalent difference of convex problem by decoupling the conditional constraints, and solve the transformed problem via penalty convex-concave procedure algorithm. <b>Simulation</b> results demonstrate that the OTFS modulation is robust to carrier frequency offsets (CFO) caused by high-mobility of LEO satellites, and has superior performance to the OFDM modulation. Moreover, numerical results indicate that our proposed resource allocation scheme has higher sum-rate than existed schemes for the OTFS modulation, such as delay divided multiple access and Doppler divided multiple access, especially in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime.

**ABSTRACT**  
Nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) is a popular strategy for solving motion planning problems, including obstacle avoidance constraints, in autonomous driving applications. Non-smooth obstacle shapes, such as rectangles, introduce additional local minima in the underlying optimization problem. Smooth over-approximations, e.g., ellipsoidal shapes, limit the performance due to their conservativeness. We propose to vary the smoothness and the related over-approximation by a homotopy. Instead of varying the smoothness in consecutive sequential quadratic programming iterations, we use formulations that decrease the smooth over-approximation from the end towards the beginning of the prediction horizon. Thus, the real-time iterations algorithm is applicable to the proposed NMPC formulation. Different formulations are compared in <b>simulation</b> experiments and shown to successfully improve performance indicators without increasing the computation time.

**ABSTRACT**  
Due to more volatile generation, flexibility will become more important in transmission grids. One potential source of this flexibility can be distribution grids. A flexibility request from the transmission grid to a distribution grid then needs to be split up onto the different flexibility providing units (FPU) in the distribution grid. One potential way to do this is Online Feedback Optimization (OFO). OFO is a new control method that steers power systems to the optimal solution of an optimization problem using minimal model information and computation power. This paper will show how to choose the optimization problem and how to tune the OFO controller. Afterward, we test the resulting controller on a real distribution grid laboratory and show its performance, its interaction with other controllers in the grid, and how it copes with disturbances. Overall, the paper makes a clear <b>recommendation</b> on how to phrase the optimization problem and tune the OFO controller. Furthermore, it experimentally verifies that an OFO controller is a powerful tool to disaggregate flexibility requests onto FPUs while satisfying operational constraints inside the flexibility providing distribution grid.

**ABSTRACT**  
To achieve complete autonomous vehicles, it is crucial for autonomous vehicles to communicate and interact with their surrounding vehicles. Especially, since the lane change scenarios do not have traffic signals and traffic rules, the interactions between vehicles need to be considered for the autonomous vehicles. To address this issue, we propose a cooperative and interaction-aware decision-making algorithm for autonomous vehicles that stochastically considers the future behavior of surrounding vehicles based on actual driving data. The algorithm is designed for both lane changing and lane keeping vehicles, and effectively considers interaction by using an interaction model based on relative information between vehicles with fewer states. To design the decision-making, the interaction model is defined as <b>Markov</b> <b>decision</b> <b>process,</b> and stochastic dynamic programming is used to solve the <b>Markov</b> <b>decision</b> <b>process.</b> We validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm in lane change scenarios that require interaction. Our results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm enables cooperative and interaction-aware decision-making while accommodating various driving styles. Additionally, by comparing it with other methods, such as the intelligent driver model and game theory-based decision-making, we validate the safety and comfortable decision-making of our proposed algorithm. Furthermore, through driving with a human-driven vehicle, it is confirmed that the proposed decision-making enables to cooperatively and effectively drive with humans.

**ABSTRACT**  
Iterative learning control (ILC) is capable of improving the tracking performance of repetitive control systems by utilizing data from past iterations. The aim of this paper is to achieve both task flexibility, which is often achieved by ILC with basis functions, and the performance of frequency-domain ILC, with an intuitive design procedure. The cost function of norm-optimal ILC is determined that recovers frequency-domain ILC, and consequently, the feedforward signal is parameterized in terms of basis functions and frequency-domain ILC. The resulting method has the performance and design procedure of frequency-domain ILC and the task flexibility of basis functions ILC, and are complimentary to each other. Validation on a <b>benchmark</b> example confirms the capabilities of the framework.

**ABSTRACT**  
We present the first algorithm for query learning of a general class of Mealy machines with timers (MMTs) in a <b>black-box</b> <b>context.</b> Our algorithm is an extension of the L# algorithm of Vaandrager et al. to a timed setting. Like the algorithm for learning timed automata proposed by Waga, our algorithm is inspired by ideas of Maler & Pnueli. Based on the elementary languages of, both Waga's and our algorithm use symbolic queries, which are then implemented using finitely many concrete queries. However, whereas Waga needs exponentially many concrete queries to implement a single symbolic query, we only need a polynomial number. This is because in order to learn a timed automaton, a learner needs to determine the exact guard and reset for each transition (out of exponentially many possibilities), whereas for learning an MMT a learner only needs to figure out which of the preceding transitions caused a timeout. As shown in our previous work, this can be done efficiently for a subclass of MMTs that are race-avoiding: if a timeout is caused by a preceding input then a slight change in the timing of this input will induce a corresponding change in the timing of the timeout ("wiggling"). Experiments with a prototype implementation, written in Rust, show that our algorithm is able to efficiently learn realistic <b>benchmarks.</b>

**ABSTRACT**  
The recent developments in neural fields have brought phenomenal capabilities to the field of shape generation, but they lack crucial properties, such as incremental control - a fundamental requirement for artistic work. Triangular meshes, on the other hand, are the representation of choice for most <b>geometry</b> related tasks, offering efficiency and intuitive control, but do not lend themselves to neural optimization. To support downstream tasks, previous art typically proposes a two-step approach, where first a shape is generated using neural fields, and then a mesh is extracted for further processing. Instead, in this paper we introduce a hybrid approach that maintains both a mesh and a Signed Distance Field (SDF) representations consistently. Using this representation, we introduce MagicClay - an artist friendly tool for sculpting regions of a mesh according to textual <b>prompts</b> while keeping other regions untouched. Our framework carefully and efficiently balances consistency between the representations and regularizations in every step of the shape optimization; Relying on the mesh representation, we show how to render the SDF at higher resolutions and faster. In addition, we employ recent work in differentiable mesh reconstruction to adaptively allocate triangles in the mesh where required, as indicated by the SDF. Using an implemented prototype, we demonstrate superior generated <b>geometry</b> compared to the state-of-the-art, and novel consistent control, allowing sequential <b>prompt-based</b> edits to the same mesh for the first time.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this paper, we present a framework based on <b>differential</b> <b>privacy</b> (DP) for querying electric power measurements to detect system anomalies or bad data caused by false data injections (FDIs). Our DP approach conceals consumption and system matrix data, while simultaneously enabling an untrusted third party to test hypotheses of anomalies, such as an FDI attack, by releasing a randomized sufficient statistic for hypothesis-testing. We consider a measurement model corrupted by Gaussian noise and a sparse noise vector representing the attack, and we observe that the optimal test statistic is a chi-square random variable. To detect possible attacks, we propose a novel DP chi-square noise mechanism that ensures the test does not reveal private information about power injections or the system matrix. The proposed framework provides a robust solution for detecting FDIs while preserving the privacy of sensitive power system data.

In game theory, a game refers to a model of interaction among rational decision-makers or players, making choices with the goal of achieving their individual objectives. Understanding their behavior in games is often referred to as game <b>reasoning.</b> This survey provides a comprehensive overview of a fast-developing game-reasoning framework for large games, known as Policy Space Response Oracles (PSRO). We first motivate PSRO, provide historical context, and position PSRO within game-reasoning approaches. We then focus on the strategy exploration issue for PSRO, the challenge of assembling an effective strategy portfolio for modeling the underlying game with minimum computational cost. We also survey current research directions for enhancing the efficiency of PSRO, and explore the applications of PSRO across various domains. We conclude by discussing open questions and future research.

**ABSTRACT**  
Timed automata are the formal model for real-time systems. Extensions with discrete probabilistic branching have been considered in the literature and successfully applied. Probabilistic timed automata (PTA) do require all branching probabilities and clock constraints to be constants. This report investigates PTA in which this constraint is relaxed: both branching probabilities and clock constraints can be parametric. We formally define this PTA variant and define its semantics by an uncountable parametric <b>Markov</b> <b>Decision</b> <b>Process</b> (pMDP). We show that reachability probabilities in parametric L/U-PTA can be reduced to considering PTA with only parametric branching probabilities. This enables the usage of existing techniques from the literature. Finally, we generalize the symbolic backward and digital clock semantics of PTA to the setting with parametric probabilities and constraints.

**ABSTRACT**  
Pointer arithmetic is widely used in low-level programs, e.g. memory allocators. The specification of such programs usually requires using pointer arithmetic inside inductive definitions to define the common data structures, e.g. heap lists in memory allocators. In this work, we investigate decision problems for SLAH, a separation logic fragment that allows pointer arithmetic inside inductive definitions, thus enabling specification of properties for programs manipulating heap lists. Pointer arithmetic inside inductive definitions is challenging for automated <b>reasoning.</b> We tackle this challenge and achieve decision procedures for both satisfiability and entailment of SLAH formulas. The crux of our decision procedure for satisfiability is to compute summaries of inductive definitions. We show that although the summary is naturally expressed as an existentially quantified non-linear arithmetic formula, it can actually be transformed into an equivalent linear arithmetic formula. The decision procedure for entailment, on the other hand, has to match and split the spatial atoms according to the arithmetic relation between address variables. We report on the implementation of these decision procedures and their good performance in solving problems issued from the verification of building block programs used in memory allocators.

**ABSTRACT**  
Laboratory experiments have shown that communication plays an important role in solving social dilemmas. Here, by extending the AI-Economist, a mixed motive multi-agent <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning</b> environment, I intend to find an answer to the following descriptive question: which governing system does facilitate the emergence and evolution of communication and teaching among agents? To answer this question, the AI-Economist is extended by a voting mechanism to simulate three different governing systems across individualistic-collectivistic axis, from full-libertarian to Full-Utilitarian governing systems. Moreover, the AI-Economist is further extended to include communication with possible misalignment, a variant of signalling game, by letting agents to build houses together if they are able to name mutually complement material resources by the same letter. Moreover, another extension is made to the AI-Economist to include teaching with possible misalignment, again a variant of signalling game, by letting half the agents as teachers who know how to use mutually complement material resources to build houses but are not capable of building actual houses, and the other half as students who do not have this information but are able to actually build those houses if teachers teach them. I found a strong evidence that collectivistic environment such as Full-Utilitarian system is more favourable for the emergence of communication and teaching, or more precisely, evolution of language alignment. Moreover, I found some evidence that evolution of language alignment through communication and teaching under collectivistic governing systems makes individuals more advantageously inequity averse. As a result, there is a positive correlation between evolution of language alignment and equality in the society.

**ABSTRACT**  
The right ventricular (RV) function deterioration strongly predicts clinical outcomes in numerous circumstances. To boost the clinical deployment of ensemble regression methods that quantify RV volumes using tabular data from the widely available two-dimensional echocardiography (2DE), we propose to complement the volume predictions with uncertainty scores. To this end, we employ an instance-based method which uses the learned tree structure to identify the nearest training samples to a target instance and then uses a number of distribution types to more flexibly model the output. The probabilistic and point-prediction performances of the proposed framework are evaluated on a relatively small-scale dataset, comprising 100 end-diastolic and end-systolic RV volumes. The reference values for point performance were obtained from MRI. The results demonstrate that our flexible approach yields improved probabilistic and point performances over other state-of-the-art methods. The appropriateness of the proposed framework is showcased by providing exemplar cases. The estimated uncertainty embodies both aleatoric and epistemic types. This work aligns with trustworthy artificial intelligence since it can be used to enhance the decision-making process and reduce risks. The feature importance scores of our framework can be exploited to reduce the number of required 2DE views which could enhance the proposed pipeline's clinical application.

**ABSTRACT**  
Shannon entropy regularization is widely adopted in optimal control due to its ability to promote exploration and enhance robustness, e.g., maximum entropy <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning</b> known as Soft Actor-Critic. In this paper, Tsallis entropy, which is a one-parameter extension of Shannon entropy, is used for the regularization of linearly solvable MDP and linear quadratic regulators. We derive the solution for these problems and demonstrate its usefulness in balancing between exploration and sparsity of the obtained control law.

**ABSTRACT**  
Link prediction typically studies the probability of future interconnection among nodes with the observation in a single social network. More often than not, real scenario is presented as a multiplex network with common (anchor) users active in multiple social networks. In the literature, most existing works study either the intra-link prediction in a single network or inter-link prediction among networks (a.k.a. network alignment), and consider two learning tasks are independent from each other, which is still away from the fact. On the representation space, the vast majority of existing methods are built upon the traditional Euclidean space, unaware of the inherent <b>geometry</b> of social networks. The third issue is on the scarce anchor users. Annotating anchor users is laborious and expensive, and thus it is impractical to work with quantities of anchor users. Herein, in light of the issues above, we propose to study a challenging yet practical problem of <b>Geometry-aware</b> Collective Link Prediction across Multiplex Network. To address this problem, we present a novel contrastive model, RCoCo, which collaborates intra- and inter-network behaviors in Riemannian spaces. In RCoCo, we design a curvature-aware <b>graph</b> attention network ($\kappa-$GAT), conducting attention mechanism in Riemannian manifold whose curvature is estimated by the Ricci curvatures over the network. Thereafter, we formulate intra- and inter-contrastive loss in the manifolds, in which we augment <b>graphs</b> by exploring the high-order structure of community and information transfer on anchor users. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments with 14 strong baselines on 8 real-world datasets, and show the effectiveness of RCoCo.

**ABSTRACT**  
Prediction of the Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) events garner increasing interest as space missions extend beyond Earth's protective magnetosphere. These events, which are, in most cases, products of magnetic reconnection-driven processes during solar flares or fast coronal-mass-ejection-driven shock waves, pose significant radiation hazards to aviation, space-based electronics, and particularly, space exploration. In this work, we utilize the recently developed dataset that combines the Solar Dynamics Observatory/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager's (SDO/HMI) Space weather HMI Active Region Patches (SHARP) and the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory/Michelson Doppler Imager's (SoHO/MDI) Space Weather MDI Active Region Patches (SMARP). We employ a suite of machine learning strategies, including Support Vector Machines (SVM) and regression models, to evaluate the predictive potential of this new data product for a forecast of post-solar flare SEP events. Our study indicates that despite the augmented volume of data, the prediction accuracy reaches 0.7 +- 0.1, which aligns with but does not exceed these published <b>benchmarks.</b> A linear SVM model with training and testing configurations that mimic an operational setting (positive-negative imbalance) reveals a slight increase (+ 0.04 +- 0.05) in the accuracy of a 14-hour SEP forecast compared to previous studies. This outcome emphasizes the imperative for more sophisticated, physics-informed models to better understand the underlying processes leading to SEP events.

**ABSTRACT**  
Let $D$ be a digraph. Its acyclic number $\vec{\alpha}(D)$ is the maximum order of an acyclic induced subdigraph and its dichromatic number $\vec{\chi}(D)$ is the least integer $k$ such that $V(D)$ can be partitioned into $k$ subsets inducing acyclic subdigraphs. We study ${\vec a}(n)$ and $\vec t(n)$ which are the minimum of $\vec\alpha(D)$ and the maximum of $\vec{\chi}(D)$, respectively, over all oriented triangle-free <b>graphs</b> of order $n$. For every $\epsilon>0$ and $n$ large enough, we show $(1/\sqrt{2} - \epsilon) \sqrt{n\log n} \leq \vec{a}(n) \leq \frac{107}{8} \sqrt n \log n$ and $\frac{8}{107} \sqrt n/\log n \leq \vec{t}(n) \leq (\sqrt 2 + \epsilon) \sqrt{n/\log n}$. We also construct an oriented triangle-free <b>graph</b> on 25 vertices with dichromatic number~3, and show that every oriented triangle-free <b>graph</b> of order at most 17 has dichromatic number at most 2.

**ABSTRACT**  
The most elusive problem around the class of circular-arc <b>graphs</b> is identifying all minimal <b>graphs</b> that are not in this class. The main obstacle is the lack of a systematic way of enumerating these minimal <b>graphs.</b> McConnell [FOCS 2001] presented a transformation from circular-arc <b>graphs</b> to interval <b>graphs</b> with certain patterns of representations. We fully characterize these interval patterns for circular-arc <b>graphs</b> that are split <b>graphs,</b> thereby building a connection between minimal split <b>graphs</b> that are not circular-arc <b>graphs</b> and minimal non-interval <b>graphs.</b> This connection enables us to identify all minimal split <b>graphs</b> that are not circular-arc <b>graphs.</b> As a byproduct, we develop a linear-time certifying recognition algorithm for circular-arc <b>graphs</b> when the input is a split <b>graph.</b>

**ABSTRACT**  
Weakly modular <b>graphs</b> are defined as the class of <b>graphs</b> that satisfy the \emph{triangle condition ($TC$)} and the \emph{quadrangle condition ($QC$)}. We study an interesting subclass of weakly modular <b>graphs</b> that satisfies a stronger version of the triangle condition, known as the \emph{triangle diamond condition ($TDC$)}. and term this subclass of weakly modular <b>graphs</b> as the \emph{diamond-weakly modular graphs}. It is observed that this class contains the class of bridged <b>graphs</b> and the class of weakly bridged <b>graphs.</b> The interval function $I_G$ of a connected <b>graph</b> $G$ with vertex set $V$ is an important concept in metric <b>graph</b> theory and is one of the prime example of a transit function; a set function defined on the Cartesian product $V\times V$ to the power set of $V$ satisfying the expansive, symmetric and idempotent axioms. In this paper, we derive an interesting axiom denoted as $(J0')$, obtained from a well-known axiom introduced by Marlow Sholander in 1952, denoted as $(J0)$. It is proved that the axiom $(J0')$ is a characterizing axiom of the diamond-weakly modular <b>graphs.</b> We propose certain types of independent first-order betweenness axioms on an arbitrary transit function $R$ and prove that an arbitrary transit function becomes the interval function of a diamond-weakly modular <b>graph</b> if and only if $R$ satisfies these betweenness axioms. Similar characterizations are obtained for the interval function of bridged <b>graphs</b> and weakly bridged <b>graphs.</b>

**ABSTRACT**  
The network-based study of financial systems has received considerable attention in recent years but has seldom explicitly incorporated the dynamic aspects of such systems. We consider this problem setting from the temporal point of view and introduce the Interval Debt Model (IDM) and some scheduling problems based on it, namely: Bankruptcy Minimization/Maximization, in which the aim is to produce a payment schedule with at most/at least a given number of bankruptcies; Perfect Scheduling, the special case of the minimization variant where the aim is to produce a schedule with no bankruptcies (that is, a perfect schedule); and Bailout Minimization, in which a financial authority must allocate a smallest possible bailout package to enable a perfect schedule. We show that each of these problems is NP-complete, in many cases even on very restricted input instances. On the positive side, we provide for Perfect Scheduling a polynomial-time algorithm on (rooted) out-trees although in contrast we prove NP-completeness on directed acyclic <b>graphs,</b> as well as on instances with a constant number of nodes (and hence also constant treewidth). When we allow non-integer payments, we show by a linear programming argument that the problem Bailout Minimization can be solved in polynomial time.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this paper, we introduce tiled <b>graphs</b> as models of learning and maturing processes. We show how tiled <b>graphs</b> can combine <b>graphs</b> of learning spaces or antimatroids (partial hypercubes) and maturity models (total orders) to yield models of learning processes. For the visualization of these processes it is a natural approach to aim for certain optimal drawings. We show for most of the more detailed models that the drawing problems resulting from them are NP-complete. The terse model of a maturing process that ignores the details of learning, however, results in a polynomially solvable <b>graph</b> drawing problem. In addition, this model provides insight into the process by ordering the subjects at each test of their maturity. We investigate extremal and random instances of this problem, and provide exact results and bounds on their optimal crossing number. <b>Graph-theoretic</b> models offer two approaches to the design of optimal maturity models given observed data: (1) minimizing intra-subject inconsistencies, which manifest as regressions of subjects, is modeled as the well-known feedback arc set problem. We study the alternative of (2) finding a maturity model by minimizing the inter-subject inconsistencies, which manifest as crossings in the respective drawing. We show this to be NP-complete.

**ABSTRACT**  
The stochastic block model (SBM) is a generalization of the Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi model of random <b>graphs</b> that describes the interaction of a finite number of distinct communities. In sparse Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi <b>graphs,</b> it is known that a linear-time algorithm of Karp and Sipser achieves near-optimal matching sizes asymptotically almost surely, giving a law-of-large numbers for the matching sizes of such <b>graphs</b> in terms of solutions to an ODE. We provide an extension of this analysis, identifying broad ranges of stochastic block model parameters for which the Karp--Sipser algorithm achieves near-optimal matching sizes, but demonstrating that it cannot perform optimally on general SBM instances. We also consider the problem of constructing a matching online, in which the vertices of one half of a bipartite stochastic block model arrive one-at-a-time, and must be matched as they arrive. We show that the competitive ratio lower bound of 0.837 found by Mastin and Jaillet for the Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi case is tight whenever the expected degrees in all communities are equal. We propose several linear-time algorithms for online matching in the general stochastic block model, but prove that despite very good experimental performance, none of these achieve online asymptotic optimality.

**ABSTRACT**  
Version Control Systems, such as Git and Mercurial, manage the history of a project as a Directed Acyclic <b>Graph</b> encoding the various divergences and synchronizations happening in its life cycle. A popular workflow in the industry, called the feature branch workflow, constrains these <b>graphs</b> to be of a particular shape: a unique main branch, and non-interfering feature branches. Here we focus on the uniform random generation of those <b>graphs</b> with n vertices, including k on the main branch, for which we provide three algorithms, for three different use-cases. The first, based on rejection, is efficient when aiming for small values of k (more precisely whenever k = O($\sqrt$ n)). The second takes as input any number k of commits in the main branch, but requires costly precalculation. The last one is a Boltzmann generator and enables us to generate very large <b>graphs</b> while targeting a constant k/n ratio. All these algorithms are linear in the size of their outputs.

**ABSTRACT**  
We study the PSPACE-complete $k$-Canadian Traveller Problem, where a weighted <b>graph</b> $G=(V,E,\omega)$ with a source $s\in V$ and a target $t\in V$ are given. This problem also has a hidden input $E_* \subsetneq E$ of cardinality at most $k$ representing blocked edges. The objective is to travel from $s$ to $t$ with the minimum distance. At the beginning of the walk, the blockages $E_*$ are unknown: the traveller discovers that an edge is blocked when visiting one of its endpoints. Online algorithms, also called strategies, have been proposed for this problem and assessed with the competitive ratio, i.e. the ratio between the distance actually traversed by the traveller divided by the distance we would have traversed knowing the blockages in advance. Even though the optimal competitive ratio is $2k+1$ even on unit-weighted planar <b>graphs</b> of treewidth 2, we design a polynomial-time strategy achieving competitive ratio $9$ on unit-weighted outerplanar <b>graphs.</b> This value $9$ also stands as a lower bound for this family of <b>graphs</b> as we prove that, for any $\varepsilon > 0$, no strategy can achieve a competitive ratio $9-\varepsilon$. Finally, we show that it is not possible to achieve a constant competitive ratio (independent of $G$ and $k$) on weighted outerplanar <b>graphs.</b>

**ABSTRACT**  
We study the computational complexity of several polynomial-time-solvable <b>graph</b> problems parameterized by vertex integrity, a measure of a <b>graph's</b> vulnerability to vertex removal in terms of connectivity. Vertex integrity is the smallest number $\iota$ such that there is a set $S$ of $\iota' \le \iota$ vertices such that every connected component of $G-S$ contains at most $\iota-\iota'$ vertices. It is known that the vertex integrity lies between the well-studied parameters vertex cover number and tree-depth. Alon and Yuster [ESA 2007] designed algorithms for <b>graphs</b> with small vertex cover number using fast matrix multiplications. We demonstrate that fast matrix multiplication can also be effectively used when parameterizing by vertex integrity $\iota$ by developing efficient algorithms for problems including an $O(\iota^{\omega-1}n)$-time algorithm for computing the girth of a <b>graph,</b> randomized $O(\iota^{\omega - 1}n)$-time algorithms for Maximum Matching and for finding any induced four-vertex subgraph except for a clique or an independent set, and an $O(\iota^{(\omega-1)/2}n^2) \subseteq O(\iota^{0.687} n^2)$-time algorithm for All-Pairs Shortest Paths. These algorithms can be faster than previous algorithms parameterized by tree-depth, for which fast matrix multiplication is not known to be effective.

**ABSTRACT**  
We consider the fundamental problem of decomposing a large-scale approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) problem into smaller sub-problems. The goal is to partition the input points into neighborhood-preserving shards, so that the nearest neighbors of any point are contained in only a few shards. When a query arrives, a routing algorithm is used to identify the shards which should be searched for its nearest neighbors. This approach forms the backbone of distributed ANNS, where the dataset is so large that it must be split across multiple machines. In this paper, we design simple and highly efficient routing methods, and prove strong theoretical guarantees on their performance. A crucial characteristic of our routing algorithms is that they are inherently modular, and can be used with any partitioning method. This addresses a key drawback of prior approaches, where the routing algorithms are inextricably linked to their associated partitioning method. In particular, our new routing methods enable the use of balanced <b>graph</b> partitioning, which is a high-quality partitioning method without a naturally associated routing algorithm. Thus, we provide the first methods for routing using balanced <b>graph</b> partitioning that are extremely fast to train, admit low latency, and achieve high recall. We provide a comprehensive evaluation of our full partitioning and routing pipeline on billion-scale datasets, where it outperforms existing scalable partitioning methods by significant margins, achieving up to 2.14x higher QPS at 90% recall$@10$ than the best competitor.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recursive <b>graph</b> queries are increasingly popular for extracting information from interconnected data found in various domains such as social networks, life sciences, and business analytics. <b>Graph</b> data often come with schema information that describe how nodes and edges are organized. We propose a type inference mechanism that enriches recursive <b>graph</b> queries with relevant structural information contained in a <b>graph</b> schema. We show that this schema information can be useful in order to improve the performance when evaluating acylic recursive <b>graph</b> queries. Furthermore, we prove that the proposed method is sound and complete, ensuring that the semantics of the query is preserved during the schema-enrichment process.
