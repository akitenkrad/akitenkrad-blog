**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Large</b> <b>pre-trained</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> <b>(PLMs)</b> are at the forefront of advances in Natural Language Processing. One widespread use case of <b>PLMs</b> is <b>"prompting"</b> - or <b>in-context</b> <b>learning</b> - where a user provides a description of a task and some completed examples of the task to a <b>PLM</b> as context before <b>prompting</b> the <b>PLM</b> to perform the task on a new example. Only the largest, most capable <b>PLMs</b> are able to perform <b>in-context</b> <b>learning</b> effectively, and these models are typically trained with a predominantly English corpus, leaving all other languages behind. The data limitations in most languages preclude the training of language-specific <b>PLMs</b> capable of <b>prompting.</b> Albeit the surge in work of <b>prompting</b> settings, it is still unclear how <b>PLMs</b> should be adapted cross-lingually specifically for <b>prompting.</b> We evaluate the possible methods to adapt <b>LLaMa,</b> a 7B parameter open-source <b>PLM</b> mainly trained in English, for <b>prompting</b> in <b>low-resource</b> languages, namely for Kinyarwanda, Hausa, and Luganda. We consider three methods: <b>few-shot</b> <b>prompting</b> <b>(prompt),</b> language-adaptive <b>fine-tuning</b> (LAFT), and <b>neural</b> <b>machine</b> <b>translation</b> (translate), and evaluate on abstractive <b>summarization,</b> multi-class topic classification, and <b>named-entity</b> <b>recognition.</b> <b>Although</b> LAFT carries the greatest compute cost and intuitively should lead to the best results, our experiments exhibit that LAFT is only occasionally the optimal choice for adapting <b>PLMs</b> for <b>prompting.</b> Rather, the translate and <b>prompt</b> settings are a compute-efficient and cost-effective method of <b>few-shot</b> <b>prompting</b> for the selected <b>low-resource</b> languages. We find that the results are task and language dependent but find that the <b>prompting</b> method is the best on average across all tasks and languages. Results show that the <b>prompt</b> setting performs better than both translating and LAFT with statistical significance for all shots when aggregated across all tasks and languages.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Large</b> <b>Language</b> <b>Models</b> <b>(LLMs)</b> have significantly advanced healthcare innovation on generation capabilities. However, their application in real clinical settings is challenging due to potential deviations from medical facts and inherent biases. In this work, we develop an augmented <b>LLM</b> framework, <b>KG-Rank,</b> which leverages a medical <b>knowledge</b> <b>graph</b> <b>(KG)</b> with ranking and re-ranking techniques, aiming to improve free-text <b>question-answering</b> <b>(QA)</b> in the medical domain. Specifically, upon receiving a <b>question,</b> <b>we</b> initially retrieve triplets from a medical <b>KG</b> to gather factual information. Subsequently, we innovatively apply ranking methods to refine the ordering of these triplets, aiming to yield more precise answers. To the best of our <b>knowledge,</b> <b>KG-Rank</b> is the first application of ranking models combined with <b>KG</b> in medical <b>QA</b> specifically for generating long answers. Evaluation of four selected medical <b>QA</b> datasets shows that <b>KG-Rank</b> achieves an improvement of over 18% in the <b>ROUGE-L</b> score. Moreover, we extend <b>KG-Rank</b> to open domains, where it realizes a 14% improvement in <b>ROUGE-L,</b> showing the effectiveness and potential of <b>KG-Rank.</b>

**ABSTRACT**  
The advancement of natural language processing (NLP) systems in healthcare hinges on language model ability to interpret the intricate <b>information</b> <b>contained</b> within clinical notes. This process often requires integrating <b>information</b> <b>from</b> various time points in a patient's medical history. However, most earlier clinical language models were pretrained with a context length limited to roughly one clinical document. In this study, We introduce ClinicalMamba, a specialized version of the Mamba language model, pretrained on a vast corpus of longitudinal clinical notes to address the unique linguistic characteristics and <b>information</b> <b>processing</b> needs of the medical domain. ClinicalMamba, with 130 million and 2.8 billion parameters, demonstrates a superior performance in modeling clinical language across extended text lengths compared to Mamba and clinical <b>Llama.</b> With <b>few-shot</b> <b>learning,</b> ClinicalMamba achieves notable <b>benchmarks</b> in speed and accuracy, outperforming existing clinical language models and general domain large models like <b>GPT-4</b> in longitudinal clinical notes <b>information</b> <b>extraction</b> tasks.

**ABSTRACT**  
Despite advancements in on-topic <b>dialogue</b> <b>systems,</b> effectively managing topic shifts within <b>dialogues</b> <b>remains</b> a persistent challenge, largely attributed to the limited availability of training datasets. To address this issue, we propose Multi-Passage to <b>Dialogue</b> <b>(MP2D),</b> a data generation framework that automatically creates conversational <b>question-answering</b> <b>datasets</b> with natural topic transitions. By leveraging the relationships between entities in a <b>knowledge</b> <b>graph,</b> MP2D maps the flow of topics within a <b>dialogue,</b> <b>effectively</b> mirroring the dynamics of human conversation. It retrieves relevant passages corresponding to the topics and transforms them into <b>dialogues</b> <b>through</b> the passage-to-dialogue method. Through quantitative and qualitative experiments, we demonstrate MP2D's efficacy in generating <b>dialogue</b> <b>with</b> natural topic shifts. Furthermore, this study introduces a novel <b>benchmark</b> for topic shift <b>dialogues,</b> <b>TS-WikiDialog.</b> Utilizing the dataset, we demonstrate that even <b>Large</b> <b>Language</b> <b>Models</b> <b>(LLMs)</b> struggle to handle topic shifts in <b>dialogue</b> <b>effectively,</b> and we showcase the performance improvements of models trained on datasets generated by MP2D across diverse topic shift <b>dialogue</b> <b>tasks.</b>

**ABSTRACT**  
As <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> <b>(LLMs)</b> are increasingly deployed in user-facing applications, building trust and maintaining safety by accurately quantifying a model's confidence in its prediction becomes even more important. However, finding effective ways to calibrate <b>LLMs</b> - especially when the only interface to the models is their generated text - remains a challenge. We propose APRICOT (auxiliary prediction of confidence targets): A method to set confidence targets and train an additional model that predicts an <b>LLM's</b> confidence based on its textual input and output alone. This approach has several advantages: It is conceptually simple, does not require access to the target model beyond its output, does not interfere with the <b>language</b> <b>generation,</b> and has a multitude of potential usages, for instance by verbalizing the predicted confidence or adjusting the given answer based on the confidence. We show how our approach performs competitively in terms of calibration error for white-box and <b>black-box</b> <b>LLMs</b> on closed-book <b>question-answering</b> <b>to</b> detect incorrect <b>LLM</b> answers.

**ABSTRACT**  
The lack of a suitable tool for the analysis of conversational texts in the Persian language has made various analyses of these texts, including <b>Sentiment</b> <b>Analysis,</b> difficult. In this research, we tried to make the understanding of these texts easier for the machine by providing PSC, Persian Slang Converter, a tool for converting conversational texts into formal ones, and by using the most up-to-date and best deep learning methods along with the PSC, the <b>sentiment</b> <b>learning</b> of short Persian language texts for the machine in a better way. be made More than 10 million unlabeled texts from various social networks and movie subtitles (as Conversational texts) and about 10 million news texts (as formal texts) have been used for training <b>unsupervised</b> models and formal implementation of the tool. 60,000 texts from the comments of Instagram social network users with positive, negative, and neutral labels are considered <b>supervised</b> data for training the emotion classification model of short texts. Using the formal tool, 57% of the words of the corpus of conversation were converted. Finally, by using the formalizer, FastText model, and deep <b>LSTM</b> network, an accuracy of 81.91 was obtained on the test data.

**ABSTRACT**  
Conversational systems are crucial for human-computer interaction, managing complex dialogues by identifying threads and prioritising responses. This is especially vital in multi-party conversations, where precise identification of threads and strategic response prioritisation ensure efficient dialogue management. To address these challenges an end-to-end model that identifies threads and prioritises their response generation based on the importance was developed, involving a systematic decomposition of the problem into discrete components - thread detection, prioritisation, and performance optimisation which was meticulously analysed and optimised. These refined components seamlessly integrate into a unified framework, in conversational systems. Llama2 7b is used due to its high level of generalisation but the system can be updated with any open source Large Language Model(LLM). The computational capabilities of the Llama2 model was augmented by using fine tuning methods and strategic <b>prompting</b> techniques to optimise the model's performance, reducing computational time and increasing the accuracy of the model. The model achieves up to 10x speed improvement, while generating more coherent results compared to existing models.

**ABSTRACT**  
Planning is a crucial task for agents in task oriented dialogs (TODs). Human agents typically resolve user issues by following predefined workflows, decomposing workflow steps into actionable items, and performing actions by executing APIs in order; all of which require <b>reasoning</b> and planning. With the recent advances in <b>LLMs,</b> there have been increasing attempts to use <b>LLMs</b> for task planning and API usage. However, the faithfulness of the plans to predefined workflows and API dependencies, is not guaranteed with <b>LLMs</b> because of their bias towards pretraining data. Moreover, in real life, workflows are custom-defined and prone to change, hence, quickly adapting agents to the changes is desirable. In this paper, we study faithful planning in TODs to resolve user intents by following predefined flows and preserving API dependencies. We propose a constrained decoding algorithm based on lookahead heuristic for faithful planning. Our algorithm alleviates the need for <b>finetuning</b> <b>LLMs</b> using domain specific data, outperforms other decoding and <b>prompting-based</b> baselines, and applying our algorithm on smaller <b>LLMs</b> (7B) we achieve comparable performance to larger <b>LLMs</b> (30B-40B).

**ABSTRACT**  
Although <b>Large</b> <b>Language</b> <b>Models</b> <b>(LLMs)</b> are showing impressive performance on a wide range of Natural Language Processing tasks, researchers have found that they still have limited ability to conduct induction. Recent works mainly adopt ``post processes'' paradigms to improve the performance of <b>LLMs</b> on induction (e.g., the hypothesis search & refinement methods), but their performance is still constrained by the inherent inductive capability of the <b>LLMs.</b> In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Induction through Deduction (ItD), to enable the <b>LLMs</b> to teach themselves induction through deduction. The ItD framework is composed of two main components: a Deductive Data Generation module to generate induction data and a Naive Bayesian Induction module to optimize the <b>fine-tuning</b> and decoding of <b>LLMs.</b> Our empirical results showcase the effectiveness of ItD on two induction <b>benchmarks,</b> achieving relative performance improvement of 36% and 10% compared with previous state-of-the-art, respectively. Our ablation study verifies the effectiveness of two key modules of ItD. We also verify the effectiveness of ItD across different <b>LLMs</b> and deductors. The data and code of this paper can be found at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ItD-E844.

**ABSTRACT**  
We investigate the rate at which algorithms for pre-training language models have improved since the advent of deep learning. Using a dataset of over 200 language model evaluations on Wikitext and Penn Treebank spanning 2012-2023, we find that the compute required to reach a set performance threshold has halved approximately every 8 months, with a 95% confidence interval of around 5 to 14 months, substantially faster than hardware gains per Moore's Law. We estimate augmented <b>scaling</b> <b>laws,</b> which enable us to quantify algorithmic progress and determine the relative contributions of <b>scaling</b> <b>models</b> versus innovations in training algorithms. Despite the rapid pace of algorithmic progress and the development of new architectures such as the <b>transformer,</b> our analysis reveals that the increase in compute made an even larger contribution to overall performance improvements over this time period. Though limited by noisy <b>benchmark</b> data, our analysis quantifies the rapid progress in language modeling, shedding light on the relative contributions from compute and algorithms.

**ABSTRACT**  
In most recent studies, gender bias in <b>document</b> <b>ranking</b> is evaluated with the NFaiRR metric, which measures bias in a ranked list based on an aggregation over the unbiasedness scores of each ranked <b>document.</b> <b>This</b> perspective in measuring the bias of a ranked list has a key limitation: individual <b>documents</b> <b>of</b> a ranked list might be biased while the ranked list as a whole balances the groups' representations. To address this issue, we propose a novel metric called TExFAIR (term exposure-based <b>fairness),</b> which is based on two new extensions to a generic <b>fairness</b> evaluation framework, attention-weighted ranking <b>fairness</b> (AWRF). TExFAIR assesses <b>fairness</b> based on the term-based representation of groups in a ranked list: (i) an explicit definition of associating <b>documents</b> <b>to</b> groups based on probabilistic term-level associations, and (ii) a rank-biased discounting factor (RBDF) for counting non-representative <b>documents</b> <b>towards</b> the measurement of the <b>fairness</b> of a ranked list. We assess TExFAIR on the task of measuring gender bias in passage ranking, and study the relationship between TExFAIR and NFaiRR. Our experiments show that there is no strong correlation between TExFAIR and NFaiRR, which indicates that TExFAIR measures a different dimension of <b>fairness</b> than NFaiRR. With TExFAIR, we extend the AWRF framework to allow for the evaluation of <b>fairness</b> in settings with term-based representations of groups in <b>documents</b> <b>in</b> a ranked list.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recent advancements in pretraining have demonstrated that modern <b>Large</b> <b>Language</b> <b>Models</b> <b>(LLMs)</b> possess the capability to effectively learn arithmetic operations. However, despite acknowledging the significance of digit order in arithmetic computation, current methodologies predominantly rely on sequential, step-by-step approaches for teaching <b>LLMs</b> arithmetic, resulting in a conclusion where obtaining better performance involves fine-grained step-by-step. Diverging from this conventional path, our work introduces a novel strategy that not only reevaluates the digit order by prioritizing output from the least significant digit but also incorporates a step-by-step methodology to substantially reduce complexity. We have developed and applied this method in a comprehensive set of experiments. Compared to the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) method, our findings reveal an overall improvement of in accuracy while requiring only a third of the tokens typically used during training. For the purpose of facilitating replication and further research, we have made our code and dataset publicly available at \url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/RAIT-9FB7/}.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Text</b> <b>summarization</b> and simplification are among the most widely used applications of AI. However, models developed for such tasks are often prone to hallucination, which can result from training on unaligned data. One efficient approach to address this issue is Loss Truncation (LT) (Kang and Hashimoto, 2020), an approach to modify the standard log loss to adaptively remove noisy examples during training. However, we find that LT alone yields a considerable number of hallucinated entities on various datasets. We study the behavior of the underlying losses between factual and non-factual examples, to understand and refine the performance of LT. We demonstrate that LT's performance is limited when the underlying assumption that noisy targets have higher NLL loss is not satisfied, and find that word-level NLL among entities provides better signal for distinguishing factuality. We then leverage this to propose a fine-grained NLL loss and fine-grained data cleaning strategies, and observe improvements in hallucination reduction across some datasets. Our work is available at https://https://github.com/yale-nlp/fine-grained-lt.

**ABSTRACT**  
Deep phenotyping is the detailed description of patient signs and symptoms using concepts from an ontology. The deep phenotyping of the numerous physician notes in electronic health records requires high throughput methods. Over the past thirty years, progress toward making high throughput phenotyping feasible. In this study, we demonstrate that a <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>model</b> and a hybrid NLP model (combining word vectors with a machine learning classifier) can perform high throughput phenotyping on physician notes with high accuracy. <b>Large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> will likely emerge as the preferred method for high throughput deep phenotyping of physician notes.

**ABSTRACT**  
The ongoing trend of hardware specialization has led to a growing use of custom data formats when processing sparse workloads, which are typically memory-bound. These formats facilitate optimized software/hardware implementations by utilizing sparsity pattern- or target-aware data structures and layouts to enhance memory access latency and bandwidth utilization. However, existing sparse tensor programming models and compilers offer little or no support for productively customizing the sparse formats. Additionally, because these frameworks represent formats using a limited set of per-dimension attributes, they lack the flexibility to accommodate numerous new variations of custom sparse data structures and layouts. To overcome this deficiency, we propose UniSparse, an intermediate language that provides a unified abstraction for representing and customizing sparse formats. Unlike the existing attribute-based frameworks, UniSparse decouples the logical representation of the sparse tensor (i.e., the data structure) from its low-level memory layout, enabling the customization of both. As a result, a rich set of format customizations can be succinctly expressed in a small set of well-defined query, mutation, and layout primitives. We also develop a compiler leveraging the MLIR infrastructure, which supports adaptive customization of formats, and automatic <b>code</b> <b>generation</b> of format conversion and compute operations for heterogeneous architectures. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through experiments running commonly-used sparse linear algebra operations with specialized formats on multiple different hardware targets, including an Intel CPU, an NVIDIA GPU, an AMD Xilinx FPGA, and a simulated processing-in-memory (PIM) device.

**ABSTRACT**  
Token-based <b>text-to-speech</b> <b>(TTS)</b> models have emerged as a promising avenue for generating natural and realistic speech, yet they grapple with low pronunciation accuracy, speaking style and timbre inconsistency, and a substantial need for diverse training <b>data.</b> <b>In</b> response, we introduce a novel hierarchical acoustic modeling approach complemented by a tailored <b>data</b> <b>augmentation</b> strategy and train it on the combination of real and synthetic <b>data,</b> <b>scaling</b> the <b>data</b> <b>size</b> up to 650k hours, leading to the <b>zero-shot</b> <b>TTS</b> model with 0.8B parameters. Specifically, our method incorporates a latent variable sequence containing supplementary acoustic information based on refined <b>self-supervised</b> <b>learning</b> (SSL) discrete units into the <b>TTS</b> model by a predictor. This significantly mitigates pronunciation errors and style mutations in synthesized speech. During training, we strategically replace and duplicate segments of the <b>data</b> <b>to</b> enhance timbre uniformity. Moreover, a pretrained <b>few-shot</b> voice conversion model is utilized to generate a plethora of voices with identical content yet varied timbres. This facilitates the explicit learning of utterance-level one-to-many mappings, enriching speech diversity and also ensuring consistency in timbre. Comparative experiments (Demo page: https://anonymous.4open.science/w/ham-tts/)demonstrate our model's superiority over VALL-E in pronunciation precision and maintaining speaking style, as well as timbre continuity.

**ABSTRACT**  
Acoustic-to-articulatory inversion (AAI) is to convert audio into articulator movements, such as ultrasound tongue imaging (UTI) data. An issue of existing AAI methods is only using the personalized acoustic information to derive the general patterns of tongue motions, and thus the quality of generated UTI data is limited. To address this issue, this paper proposes an audio-textual <b>diffusion</b> <b>model</b> for the UTI data generation task. In this model, the inherent acoustic characteristics of individuals related to the tongue motion details are encoded by using wav2vec 2.0, while the <b>ASR</b> transcriptions related to the universality of tongue motions are encoded by using <b>BERT.</b> UTI data are then generated by using a <b>diffusion</b> <b>module.</b> Experimental results showed that the proposed <b>diffusion</b> <b>model</b> could generate high-quality UTI data with clear tongue contour that is crucial for the linguistic analysis and clinical assessment.

**ABSTRACT**  
Speech applications are expected to be low-power and robust under noisy conditions. An effective Voice Activity Detection (VAD) front-end lowers the computational need. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are known to be biologically plausible and power-efficient. However, SNN-based VADs have yet to achieve noise robustness and often require large models for high performance. This paper introduces a novel SNN-based VAD model, referred to as sVAD, which features an auditory encoder with an SNN-based attention mechanism. Particularly, it provides effective auditory feature representation through SincNet and 1D <b>convolution,</b> and improves noise robustness with attention mechanisms. The classifier utilizes Spiking <b>Recurrent</b> <b>Neural</b> <b>Networks</b> (sRNN) to exploit temporal speech information. Experimental results demonstrate that our sVAD achieves remarkable noise robustness and meanwhile maintains low power consumption and a small footprint, making it a promising solution for real-world VAD applications.

**ABSTRACT**  
In the realm of computational <b>knowledge</b> <b>representation,</b> <b>Knowledge</b> <b>Graph</b> <b>Reasoning</b> <b>(KG-R)</b> stands at the forefront of facilitating sophisticated inferential capabilities across multifarious domains. The quintessence of this research elucidates the employment of <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning</b> (RL) strategies, notably the REINFORCE algorithm, to navigate the intricacies inherent in multi-hop <b>KG-R.</b> This investigation critically addresses the prevalent challenges introduced by the inherent incompleteness of <b>Knowledge</b> <b>Graphs</b> <b>(KGs),</b> which frequently results in erroneous inferential outcomes, manifesting as both false negatives and misleading positives. By partitioning the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) <b>benchmark</b> dataset into rich and sparse subsets, we investigate the efficacy of pre-trained <b>BERT</b> embeddings and <b>Prompt</b> <b>Learning</b> methodologies to refine the reward shaping process. This approach not only enhances the precision of multi-hop <b>KG-R</b> but also sets a new precedent for future research in the field, aiming to improve the robustness and accuracy of <b>knowledge</b> <b>inference</b> within complex <b>KG</b> frameworks. Our work contributes a novel perspective to the discourse on <b>KG</b> <b>reasoning,</b> offering a methodological advancement that aligns with the academic rigor and scholarly aspirations of the Natural journal, promising to invigorate further advancements in the realm of computational <b>knowledge</b> <b>representation.</b>

**ABSTRACT**  
Significant uncertainty in climate prediction and cloud physics is tied to observational gaps relating to shallow scattered clouds. Addressing these challenges requires remote sensing of their three-dimensional (3D) heterogeneous volumetric scattering content. This calls for passive scattering computed tomography (CT). We design a learning-based model (ProbCT) to achieve CT of such clouds, based on noisy multi-view spaceborne images. ProbCT infers - for the first time - the posterior probability distribution of the heterogeneous extinction coefficient, per 3D location. This yields arbitrary valuable statistics, e.g., the 3D field of the most probable extinction and its uncertainty. ProbCT uses a neural-field representation, making essentially real-time inference. ProbCT undergoes <b>supervised</b> training by a new labeled multi-class database of physics-based volumetric fields of clouds and their corresponding images. To improve <b>out-of-distribution</b> inference, we incorporate <b>self-supervised</b> <b>learning</b> through differential rendering. We demonstrate the approach in <b>simulations</b> and on real-world data, and indicate the relevance of 3D recovery and uncertainty to precipitation and renewable energy.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Multimodal</b> language models <b>(MLMs)</b> are designed to process and integrate information from multiple sources, such as text, speech, images, and videos. Despite its success in language understanding, it is critical to evaluate the performance of downstream tasks for better human-centric applications. This paper assesses the application of <b>MLMs</b> with 5 crucial abilities for affective computing, spanning from visual affective tasks and <b>reasoning</b> tasks. The results show that <b>GPT4</b> has high accuracy in facial action unit recognition and micro-expression detection while its general facial expression recognition performance is not accurate. We also highlight the challenges of achieving fine-grained micro-expression recognition and the potential for further study and demonstrate the versatility and potential of <b>GPT4</b> for handling advanced tasks in <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> and related fields by integrating with task-related agents for more complex tasks, such as heart rate estimation through signal processing. In conclusion, this paper provides valuable insights into the potential applications and challenges of <b>MLMs</b> in human-centric computing.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Knowledge</b> <b>distillation</b> is an attractive approach for learning compact deep neural networks, which learns a lightweight student model by <b>distilling</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>from</b> a complex teacher model. Attention-based <b>knowledge</b> <b>distillation</b> is a specific form of intermediate feature-based <b>knowledge</b> <b>distillation</b> that uses attention mechanisms to encourage the student to better mimic the teacher. However, most of the previous attention-based <b>distillation</b> approaches perform attention in the spatial domain, which primarily affects local regions in the input image. This may not be sufficient when we need to capture the broader context or global information necessary for effective <b>knowledge</b> <b>transfer.</b> In frequency domain, since each frequency is determined from all pixels of the image in spatial domain, it can contain global information about the image. Inspired by the benefits of the frequency domain, we propose a novel module that functions as an attention mechanism in the frequency domain. The module consists of a learnable global filter that can adjust the frequencies of student's features under the guidance of the teacher's features, which encourages the student's features to have patterns similar to the teacher's features. We then propose an enhanced <b>knowledge</b> <b>review-based</b> <b>distillation</b> model by leveraging the proposed frequency attention module. The extensive experiments with various teacher and student architectures on image classification and <b>object</b> <b>detection</b> <b>benchmark</b> datasets show that the proposed approach outperforms other <b>knowledge</b> <b>distillation</b> methods.

Toward this, (i) we open-source the largest dataset of general surgery videos to-date, consisting of 680 hours of surgical videos, including data from robotic and laparoscopic techniques across 28 procedures; (ii) we propose a technique for video pre-training a general surgery <b>vision</b> <b>transformer</b> (GSViT) on surgical videos based on forward video prediction that can run in real-time for surgical applications, toward which we open-source the code and weights of GSViT; (iii) we also release code and weights for procedure-specific <b>fine-tuned</b> versions of GSViT across 10 procedures; (iv) we demonstrate the performance of GSViT on the Cholec80 phase annotation task, displaying improved performance over state-of-the-art single frame predictors.

**ABSTRACT**  
Popular <b>convolutional</b> <b>neural</b> <b>networks</b> mainly use paired images in a <b>supervised</b> way for image watermark removal. However, watermarked images do not have reference images in the real world, which results in poor robustness of image watermark removal techniques. In this paper, we propose a <b>self-supervised</b> <b>convolutional</b> <b>neural</b> <b>network</b> <b>(CNN)</b> in image watermark removal (SWCNN). SWCNN uses a <b>self-supervised</b> way to construct reference watermarked images rather than given paired training samples, according to watermark distribution. A heterogeneous U-Net architecture is used to extract more complementary structural information via simple components for image watermark removal. Taking into account texture information, a mixed loss is exploited to improve visual effects of image watermark removal. Besides, a watermark dataset is conducted. Experimental results show that the proposed SWCNN is superior to popular <b>CNNs</b> in image watermark removal.

**ABSTRACT**  
Change detection, which aims to detect spatial changes from a pair of multi-temporal images due to natural or man-made causes, has been widely applied in remote sensing, disaster management, urban management, etc. Most existing change detection approaches, however, are fully <b>supervised</b> and require labor-intensive pixel-level labels. To address this, we develop a novel weakly <b>supervised</b> change detection technique via <b>Knowledge</b> <b>Distillation</b> and Multiscale Sigmoid Inference <b>(KD-MSI)</b> that leverages image-level labels. In our approach, the Class Activation Maps (CAM) are utilized not only to derive a change probability map but also to serve as a foundation for the <b>knowledge</b> <b>distillation</b> process. This is done through a joint training strategy of the teacher and student networks, enabling the student network to highlight potential change areas more accurately than teacher network based on image-level labels. Moreover, we designed a Multiscale Sigmoid Inference (MSI) module as a post processing step to further refine the change probability map from the trained student network. Empirical results on three public datasets, i.e., WHU-CD, DSIFN-CD, and LEVIR-CD, demonstrate that our proposed technique, with its integrated training strategy, significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art.

**ABSTRACT**  
Long-tail recognition is challenging because it requires the model to learn good representations from tail categories and address imbalances across all categories. In this paper, we propose a novel generative and <b>fine-tuning</b> framework, LTGC, to handle long-tail recognition via leveraging generated content. Firstly, inspired by the rich implicit knowledge in <b>large-scale</b> <b>models</b> <b>(e.g.,</b> <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models,</b> <b>LLMs),</b> LTGC leverages the power of these models to parse and reason over the original tail data to produce diverse tail-class content. We then propose several novel designs for LTGC to ensure the quality of the generated data and to efficiently <b>fine-tune</b> the model using both the generated and original data. The visualization demonstrates the effectiveness of the generation module in LTGC, which produces accurate and diverse tail data. Additionally, the experimental results demonstrate that our LTGC outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on popular long-tailed <b>benchmarks.</b>

**ABSTRACT**  
Conventional medical image registration approaches directly optimize over the parameters of a transformation model. These approaches have been highly successful and are used generically for registrations of different anatomical regions. Recent deep registration networks are incredibly fast and accurate but are only trained for specific tasks. Hence, they are no longer generic registration approaches. We therefore propose uniGradICON, a first step toward a <b>foundation</b> <b>model</b> for registration providing 1) great performance \emph{across} multiple datasets which is not feasible for current learning-based registration methods, 2) <b>zero-shot</b> capabilities for new registration tasks suitable for different acquisitions, anatomical regions, and modalities compared to the training dataset, and 3) a strong initialization for <b>finetuning</b> on <b>out-of-distribution</b> registration tasks. UniGradICON unifies the speed and accuracy benefits of learning-based registration algorithms with the generic applicability of conventional non-deep-learning approaches. We extensively trained and evaluated uniGradICON on twelve different public datasets. Our code and the uniGradICON model are available at https://github.com/uncbiag/uniGradICON.

**ABSTRACT**  
We introduce a new approach using computer vision to predict the land surface displacement from subsurface <b>geometry</b> images for Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS). CCS has been proved to be a key component for a carbon neutral society. However, scientists see there are challenges along the way including the high computational cost due to the large model scale and limitations to generalize a pre-trained model with complex physics. We tackle those challenges by training models directly from the subsurface <b>geometry</b> images. The goal is to understand the respons of land surface displacement due to carbon injection and utilize our trained models to inform decision making in CCS projects. We implement multiple models <b>(CNN,</b> ResNet, and ResNetUNet) for static mechanics problem, which is a image prediction problem. Next, we use the <b>LSTM</b> and <b>transformer</b> for transient mechanics scenario, which is a video prediction problem. It shows ResNetUNet outperforms the others thanks to its architecture in static mechanics problem, and <b>LSTM</b> shows comparable performance to <b>transformer</b> in transient problem. This report proceeds by outlining our dataset in detail followed by model descriptions in method section. Result and discussion state the key learning, observations, and conclusion with future work rounds out the paper.

**ABSTRACT**  
The rapid advancement in <b>self-supervised</b> <b>learning</b> (SSL) has highlighted its potential to leverage unlabeled <b>data</b> <b>for</b> learning powerful visual <b>representations.</b> <b>However,</b> existing SSL approaches, particularly those employing different views of the same image, often rely on a limited set of predefined <b>data</b> <b>augmentations.</b> This constrains the diversity and quality of transformations, which leads to sub-optimal <b>representations.</b> <b>In</b> this paper, we introduce a novel framework that enriches the SSL paradigm by utilizing generative models to produce semantically consistent image augmentations. By directly conditioning generative models on a source image <b>representation,</b> <b>our</b> method enables the generation of diverse augmentations while maintaining the semantics of the source image, thus offering a richer set of <b>data</b> <b>for</b> <b>self-supervised</b> <b>learning.</b> Our experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly enhances the quality of learned visual <b>representations.</b> <b>This</b> research demonstrates that incorporating generative models into the SSL workflow opens new avenues for exploring the potential of unlabeled visual <b>data.</b> <b>This</b> development paves the way for more robust and versatile <b>representation</b> <b>learning</b> techniques.

**ABSTRACT**  
Context-aware <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> (CAER) has recently boosted the practical applications of affective computing techniques in unconstrained environments. Mainstream CAER methods invariably extract ensemble representations from diverse contexts and subject-centred characteristics to perceive the target person's <b>emotional</b> <b>state.</b> Despite advancements, the biggest challenge remains due to context bias interference. The harmful bias forces the models to rely on spurious correlations between background contexts and <b>emotion</b> <b>labels</b> in likelihood estimation, causing severe performance bottlenecks and confounding valuable context priors. In this paper, we propose a <b>counterfactual</b> <b>emotion</b> <b>inference</b> (CLEF) framework to address the above issue. Specifically, we first formulate a generalized causal <b>graph</b> to decouple the causal relationships among the variables in CAER. Following the causal <b>graph,</b> CLEF introduces a non-invasive context branch to capture the adverse direct effect caused by the context bias. During the inference, we eliminate the direct context effect from the total causal effect by comparing factual and <b>counterfactual</b> outcomes, resulting in bias mitigation and robust prediction. As a model-agnostic framework, CLEF can be readily integrated into existing methods, bringing consistent performance gains.

**ABSTRACT**  
Existing <b>image</b> <b>restoration</b> models are typically designed for specific tasks and struggle to generalize to out-of-sample degradations not encountered during training. While <b>zero-shot</b> methods can address this limitation by <b>fine-tuning</b> model parameters on testing samples, their effectiveness relies on predefined natural priors and physical models of specific degradations. Nevertheless, determining out-of-sample degradations faced in real-world scenarios is always impractical. As a result, it is more desirable to train restoration models with inherent generalization ability. To this end, this work introduces the Out-of-Sample Restoration (OSR) task, which aims to develop restoration models capable of handling out-of-sample degradations. An intuitive solution involves pre-translating out-of-sample degradations to known degradations of restoration models. However, directly translating them in the <b>image</b> <b>space</b> could lead to complex <b>image</b> <b>translation</b> issues. To address this issue, we propose a model reprogramming framework, which translates out-of-sample degradations by quantum mechanic and wave functions. Specifically, input <b>images</b> <b>are</b> decoupled as wave functions of amplitude and phase terms. The translation of out-of-sample degradation is performed by adapting the phase term. Meanwhile, the <b>image</b> <b>content</b> is maintained and enhanced in the amplitude term. By taking these two terms as inputs, restoration models are able to handle out-of-sample degradations without <b>fine-tuning.</b> Through extensive experiments across multiple evaluation cases, we demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of our proposed framework. Our codes are available at \href{https://github.com/ddghjikle/Out-of-sample-restoration}{Github}.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Text-to-image</b> <b>diffusion</b> <b>models</b> (T2I) use a latent representation of a text <b>prompt</b> to guide the image generation process. However, the process by which the encoder produces the text representation is unknown. We propose the <b>Diffusion</b> <b>Lens,</b> a method for analyzing the text encoder of T2I models by generating images from its intermediate representations. Using the <b>Diffusion</b> <b>Lens,</b> we perform an extensive analysis of two recent T2I models. Exploring compound <b>prompts,</b> we find that complex scenes describing multiple objects are composed progressively and more slowly compared to simple scenes; Exploring knowledge retrieval, we find that representation of uncommon concepts requires further computation compared to common concepts, and that knowledge retrieval is gradual across layers. Overall, our findings provide valuable insights into the text encoder component in T2I pipelines.

**ABSTRACT**  
Although considerable advancements have been attained in <b>self-supervised</b> <b>depth</b> estimation from monocular videos, most existing methods often treat all objects in a video as static entities, which however violates the dynamic nature of real-world scenes and fails to model the <b>geometry</b> and motion of moving objects. In this paper, we propose a <b>self-supervised</b> <b>method</b> to jointly learn 3D motion and depth from monocular videos. Our system contains a depth estimation module to predict depth, and a new decomposed object-wise 3D motion (DO3D) estimation module to predict ego-motion and 3D object motion. Depth and motion networks work collaboratively to faithfully model the <b>geometry</b> and dynamics of real-world scenes, which, in turn, benefits both depth and 3D motion estimation. Their predictions are further combined to synthesize a novel video frame for <b>self-supervised</b> <b>training.</b> As a core component of our framework, DO3D is a new motion disentanglement module that learns to predict camera ego-motion and instance-aware 3D object motion separately. To alleviate the difficulties in estimating non-rigid 3D object motions, they are decomposed to object-wise 6-DoF global transformations and a pixel-wise local 3D motion deformation field. Qualitative and quantitative experiments are conducted on three <b>benchmark</b> datasets, including KITTI, Cityscapes, and VKITTI2, where our model delivers superior performance in all evaluated settings. For the depth estimation task, our model outperforms all compared research works in the high-resolution setting, attaining an absolute relative depth error (abs rel) of 0.099 on the KITTI <b>benchmark.</b> Besides, our optical flow estimation results (an overall EPE of 7.09 on KITTI) also surpass state-of-the-art methods and largely improve the estimation of dynamic regions, demonstrating the effectiveness of our motion model. Our code will be available.

**ABSTRACT**  
Attribute and object (A-O) disentanglement is a fundamental and critical problem for Compositional <b>Zero-shot</b> <b>Learning</b> (CZSL), whose aim is to recognize novel A-O compositions based on foregone knowledge. Existing methods based on disentangled <b>representation</b> <b>learning</b> lose sight of the contextual dependency between the A-O primitive pairs. Inspired by this, we propose a novel A-O disentangled framework for CZSL, namely Class-specified Cascaded Network (CSCNet). The key insight is to firstly classify one primitive and then specifies the predicted class as a priori for guiding another primitive recognition in a cascaded fashion. To this end, CSCNet constructs Attribute-to-Object and Object-to-Attribute cascaded branches, in addition to a composition branch modeling the two primitives as a whole. Notably, we devise a parametric classifier (ParamCls) to improve the matching between visual and semantic embeddings. By improving the A-O disentanglement, our framework achieves superior results than previous competitive methods.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Self-supervised</b> feature reconstruction methods have shown promising advances in industrial image <b>anomaly</b> <b>detection</b> and localization. Despite this progress, these methods still face challenges in synthesizing realistic and diverse <b>anomaly</b> <b>samples,</b> as well as addressing the feature redundancy and pre-training bias of pre-trained feature. In this work, we introduce RealNet, a feature reconstruction network with realistic synthetic <b>anomaly</b> <b>and</b> adaptive feature selection. It is incorporated with three key innovations: First, we propose Strength-controllable Diffusion <b>Anomaly</b> <b>Synthesis</b> (SDAS), a diffusion process-based synthesis strategy capable of generating samples with varying <b>anomaly</b> <b>strengths</b> that mimic the distribution of real anomalous samples. Second, we develop <b>Anomaly-aware</b> <b>Features</b> Selection (AFS), a method for selecting representative and discriminative pre-trained feature subsets to improve <b>anomaly</b> <b>detection</b> performance while controlling computational costs. Third, we introduce Reconstruction Residuals Selection (RRS), a strategy that adaptively selects discriminative residuals for comprehensive identification of anomalous regions across multiple levels of granularity. We assess RealNet on four <b>benchmark</b> datasets, and our results demonstrate significant improvements in both Image AUROC and Pixel AUROC compared to the current state-o-the-art methods. The code, data, and models are available at https://github.com/cnulab/RealNet.

**ABSTRACT**  
Current event-/frame-event based trackers undergo evaluation on short-term tracking datasets, however, the tracking of real-world scenarios involves long-term tracking, and the performance of existing tracking algorithms in these scenarios remains unclear. In this paper, we first propose a new long-term and large-scale frame-event single object tracking dataset, termed FELT. It contains 742 videos and 1,594,474 RGB frames and event stream pairs and has become the largest frame-event tracking dataset to date. We re-train and evaluate 15 baseline trackers on our dataset for future works to compare. More importantly, we find that the RGB frames and event streams are naturally incomplete due to the influence of challenging factors and spatially sparse event flow. In response to this, we propose a novel associative memory <b>Transformer</b> network as a unified backbone by introducing modern Hopfield layers into multi-head <b>self-attention</b> blocks to fuse both RGB and event data. Extensive experiments on both FELT and RGB-T tracking dataset LasHeR fully validated the effectiveness of our model. The dataset and source code can be found at \url{https://github.com/Event-AHU/FELT_SOT_Benchmark}.

**ABSTRACT**  
Pre-trained <b>diffusion</b> <b>models</b> utilized for image generation encapsulate a substantial reservoir of a priori knowledge pertaining to intricate textures. Harnessing the potential of leveraging this a priori knowledge in the context of image super-resolution presents a compelling avenue. Nonetheless, prevailing <b>diffusion-based</b> <b>methodologies</b> presently overlook the constraints imposed by degradation information on the <b>diffusion</b> <b>process.</b> Furthermore, these methods fail to consider the spatial variability inherent in the estimated blur kernel, <b>stemming</b> from factors such as motion jitter and out-of-focus elements in open-environment scenarios. This oversight results in a notable deviation of the image super-resolution effect from fundamental realities. To address these concerns, we introduce a framework known as Adaptive <b>Multi-modal</b> Fusion of \textbf{S}patially Variant Kernel Refinement with <b>Diffusion</b> <b>Model</b> for Blind Image \textbf{S}uper-\textbf{R}esolution (SSR). Within the SSR framework, we propose a Spatially Variant Kernel Refinement (SVKR) module. SVKR estimates a Depth-Informed Kernel, which takes the depth information into account and is spatially variant. Additionally, SVKR enhance the accuracy of depth information acquired from LR images, allowing for mutual enhancement between the depth map and blur kernel estimates. Finally, we introduce the Adaptive <b>Multi-Modal</b> Fusion (AMF) module to align the information from three modalities: low-resolution images, depth maps, and blur kernels. This alignment can constrain the <b>diffusion</b> <b>model</b> to generate more authentic SR results. Quantitative and qualitative experiments affirm the superiority of our approach, while ablation experiments corroborate the effectiveness of the modules we have proposed.

**ABSTRACT**  
Accurate classification of objects in 3D point clouds is a significant problem in several applications, such as autonomous navigation and augmented/virtual reality scenarios, which has become a research hot spot. In this paper, we presented a deep learning strategy for 3D object classification in augmented reality. The proposed approach is a combination of the GRU and <b>LSTM.</b> <b>LSTM</b> networks learn longer dependencies well, but due to the number of gates, it takes longer to train; on the other hand, GRU networks have a weaker performance than <b>LSTM,</b> but their training speed is much higher than GRU, which is The speed is due to its fewer gates. The proposed approach used the combination of speed and accuracy of these two networks. The proposed approach achieved an accuracy of 0.99 in the 4,499,0641 points dataset, which includes eight classes (unlabeled, man-made terrain, natural terrain, high vegetation, low vegetation, buildings, hardscape, scanning artifacts, cars). Meanwhile, the traditional machine learning approaches could achieve a maximum accuracy of 0.9489 in the best case.

**ABSTRACT**  
Multi-Instance Learning (MIL) has shown impressive performance for histopathology whole slide image (WSI) analysis using bags or pseudo-bags. It involves instance sampling, feature representation, and decision-making. However, existing MIL-based technologies at least suffer from one or more of the following problems: 1) requiring high storage and intensive pre-processing for numerous instances (sampling); 2) potential over-fitting with limited knowledge to predict bag labels (feature representation); 3) pseudo-bag counts and prior biases affect model robustness and generalizability (decision-making). Inspired by clinical diagnostics, using the past sampling instances can facilitate the final WSI analysis, but it is barely explored in prior technologies. To break free these limitations, we integrate the dynamic instance sampling and <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning</b> into a unified framework to improve the instance selection and feature aggregation, forming a novel Dynamic Policy Instance Selection (DPIS) scheme for better and more credible decision-making. Specifically, the measurement of feature distance and reward function are employed to boost continuous instance sampling. To alleviate the over-fitting, we explore the latent global relations among instances for more robust and discriminative feature representation while establishing reward and punishment mechanisms to correct biases in pseudo-bags using <b>contrastive</b> <b>learning.</b> These strategies form the final Dynamic Policy-Driven Adaptive Multi-Instance Learning (PAMIL) method for WSI tasks. Extensive experiments reveal that our PAMIL method outperforms the state-of-the-art by 3.8\% on CAMELYON16 and 4.4\% on TCGA lung cancer datasets.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Vision-and-language</b> navigation (VLN) asks an agent to follow a given language instruction to navigate through a real 3D environment. Despite significant advances, conventional VLN agents are trained typically under disturbance-free environments and may easily fail in real-world scenarios, since they are unaware of how to deal with various possible disturbances, such as sudden obstacles or human interruptions, which widely exist and may usually cause an unexpected route deviation. In this paper, we present a model-agnostic training paradigm, called Progressive Perturbation-aware <b>Contrastive</b> <b>Learning</b> (PROPER) to enhance the generalization ability of existing VLN agents, by requiring them to learn towards deviation-robust navigation. Specifically, a simple yet effective path perturbation scheme is introduced to implement the route deviation, with which the agent is required to still navigate successfully following the original instruction. Since directly enforcing the agent to learn perturbed trajectories may lead to inefficient training, a progressively perturbed trajectory augmentation strategy is designed, where the agent can self-adaptively learn to navigate under perturbation with the improvement of its navigation performance for each specific trajectory. For encouraging the agent to well capture the difference brought by perturbation, a perturbation-aware <b>contrastive</b> <b>learning</b> mechanism is further developed by contrasting perturbation-free trajectory encodings and perturbation-based counterparts. Extensive experiments on R2R show that PROPER can benefit multiple VLN baselines in perturbation-free scenarios. We further collect the perturbed path data to construct an introspection subset based on the R2R, called Path-Perturbed R2R (PP-R2R). The results on PP-R2R show unsatisfying robustness of popular VLN agents and the capability of PROPER in improving the navigation robustness.

**ABSTRACT**  
Automated interpretation of ultrasound imaging of the heart (echocardiograms) could improve the detection and treatment of aortic stenosis (AS), a deadly heart disease. However, existing deep learning pipelines for assessing AS from echocardiograms have two key limitations. First, most methods rely on limited 2D cineloops, thereby ignoring widely available Doppler imaging that contains important complementary information about pressure gradients and blood flow abnormalities associated with AS. Second, obtaining labeled data is difficult. There are often far more unlabeled echocardiogram recordings available, but these remain underutilized by existing methods. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Semi-supervised <b>Multimodal</b> <b>Multiple-Instance</b> <b>Learning</b> <b>(SMMIL),</b> a new deep learning framework for automatic interpretation for structural heart diseases like AS. When deployed, SMMIL can combine information from two input modalities, spectral Dopplers and 2D cineloops, to produce a study-level AS diagnosis. During training, SMMIL can combine a smaller labeled set and an abundant unlabeled set of both modalities to improve its classifier. Experiments demonstrate that SMMIL outperforms recent alternatives at 3-level AS severity classification as well as several clinically relevant AS detection tasks.

**ABSTRACT**  
We introduce SPAFormer, an innovative model designed to overcome the combinatorial explosion challenge in the 3D Part Assembly (3D-PA) task. This task requires accurate prediction of each part's pose and shape in sequential steps, and as the number of parts increases, the possible assembly combinations increase exponentially, leading to a combinatorial explosion that severely hinders the efficacy of 3D-PA. SPAFormer addresses this problem by leveraging weak constraints from assembly sequences, effectively reducing the solution space's complexity. Since assembly part sequences convey construction rules similar to sentences being structured through words, our model explores both parallel and autoregressive generation. It further enhances assembly through knowledge enhancement strategies that utilize the attributes of parts and their sequence information, enabling it to capture the inherent assembly pattern and relationships among sequentially ordered parts. We also construct a more challenging <b>benchmark</b> named PartNet-Assembly covering 21 varied categories to more comprehensively validate the effectiveness of SPAFormer. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior generalization capabilities of SPAFormer, particularly with multi-tasking and in scenarios requiring long-horizon assembly. Codes and model weights will be released at \url{https://github.com/xuboshen/SPAFormer}.

**ABSTRACT**  
We humans are good at translating third-person observations of hand-object interactions (HOI) into an egocentric view. However, current methods struggle to replicate this ability of view adaptation from third-person to first-person. Although some approaches attempt to learn view-agnostic representation from large-scale video datasets, they ignore the relationships among multiple third-person views. To this end, we propose a <b>Prompt-Oriented</b> View-agnostic learning (POV) framework in this paper, which enables this view adaptation with few egocentric videos. Specifically, We introduce interactive masking <b>prompts</b> at the frame level to capture fine-grained action information, and view-aware <b>prompts</b> at the token level to learn view-agnostic representation. To verify our method, we establish two <b>benchmarks</b> for transferring from multiple third-person views to the egocentric view. Our extensive experiments on these <b>benchmarks</b> demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our POV framework and <b>prompt</b> tuning techniques in terms of view adaptation and view generalization. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/xuboshen/pov_acmmm2023}.

**ABSTRACT**  
Pedestrian trajectory prediction is a crucial component in computer vision and robotics, but remains challenging due to the <b>domain</b> <b>shift</b> problem. Previous studies have tried to tackle this problem by leveraging a portion of the trajectory data from the target <b>domain</b> <b>to</b> adapt the model. However, such <b>domain</b> <b>adaptation</b> methods are impractical in real-world scenarios, as it is infeasible to collect trajectory data from all potential target <b>domains.</b> <b>In</b> this paper, we study a task named generalized pedestrian trajectory prediction, with the aim of generalizing the model to unseen <b>domains</b> <b>without</b> accessing their trajectories. To tackle this task, we introduce a Recurrent Aligned Network~(RAN) to minimize the <b>domain</b> <b>gap</b> through <b>domain</b> <b>alignment.</b> Specifically, we devise a recurrent alignment module to effectively align the trajectory feature spaces at both time-state and time-sequence levels by the recurrent alignment strategy.Furthermore, we introduce a pre-aligned representation module to combine social interactions with the recurrent alignment strategy, which aims to consider social interactions during the alignment process instead of just target trajectories. We extensively evaluate our method and compare it with state-of-the-art methods on three widely used <b>benchmarks.</b> The experimental results demonstrate the superior generalization capability of our method. Our work not only fills the gap in the generalization setting for practical pedestrian trajectory prediction but also sets strong baselines in this field.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Contrastive</b> <b>learning</b> has achieved promising performance in the field of multi-view <b>clustering</b> recently. However, the positive and negative sample construction mechanisms ignoring semantic consistency lead to false negative pairs, limiting the performance of existing algorithms from further improvement. To solve this problem, we propose a multi-view <b>clustering</b> framework named Deep <b>Contrastive</b> <b>Multi-view</b> <b>Clustering</b> under Semantic feature guidance (DCMCS) to alleviate the influence of false negative pairs. Specifically, view-specific features are firstly extracted from raw features and fused to obtain fusion view features according to view importance. To mitigate the interference of view-private information, specific view and fusion view semantic features are learned by cluster-level <b>contrastive</b> <b>learning</b> and concatenated to measure the semantic similarity of instances. By minimizing instance-level <b>contrastive</b> <b>loss</b> weighted by semantic similarity, DCMCS adaptively weakens <b>contrastive</b> <b>leaning</b> between false negative pairs. Experimental results on several public datasets demonstrate the proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

**ABSTRACT**  
In contrast to current state-of-the-art methods, such as NSFP [25], which employ deep implicit neural functions for modeling scene flow, we present a novel approach that utilizes classical kernel representations. This representation enables our approach to effectively handle dense lidar points while demonstrating exceptional computational efficiency -- compared to recent deep approaches -- achieved through the solution of a linear system. As a runtime optimization-based method, our model exhibits impressive generalizability across various <b>out-of-distribution</b> scenarios, achieving competitive performance on large-scale lidar datasets. We propose a new positional encoding-based kernel that demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in efficient lidar scene flow estimation on large-scale point clouds. An important highlight of our method is its near real-time performance (~150-170 ms) with dense lidar data (~8k-144k points), enabling a variety of practical applications in robotics and autonomous driving scenarios.

**ABSTRACT**  
LiDAR-based 3D <b>object</b> <b>detection</b> plays an essential role in autonomous driving. Existing high-performing 3D <b>object</b> <b>detectors</b> usually build dense feature maps in the backbone network and prediction head. However, the computational costs introduced by the dense feature maps grow quadratically as the perception range increases, making these models hard to scale up to long-range detection. Some recent works have attempted to construct fully sparse detectors to solve this issue; nevertheless, the resulting models either rely on a complex multi-stage pipeline or exhibit inferior performance. In this work, we propose SAFDNet, a straightforward yet highly effective architecture, tailored for fully sparse 3D <b>object</b> <b>detection.</b> In SAFDNet, an adaptive feature diffusion strategy is designed to address the center feature missing problem. We conducted extensive experiments on Waymo Open, nuScenes, and Argoverse2 datasets. SAFDNet performed slightly better than the previous SOTA on the first two datasets but much better on the last dataset, which features long-range detection, verifying the efficacy of SAFDNet in scenarios where long-range detection is required. Notably, on Argoverse2, SAFDNet surpassed the previous best hybrid detector HEDNet by 2.6% mAP while being 2.1x faster, and yielded 2.1% mAP gains over the previous best sparse detector FSDv2 while being 1.3x faster. The code will be available at https://github.com/zhanggang001/HEDNet.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recent studies have highlighted the promising application of NeRF in autonomous driving contexts. However, the complexity of outdoor environments, combined with the restricted viewpoints in driving scenarios, complicates the task of precisely reconstructing scene <b>geometry.</b> Such challenges often lead to diminished quality in reconstructions and extended durations for both training and rendering. To tackle these challenges, we present Lightning NeRF. It uses an efficient hybrid scene representation that effectively utilizes the <b>geometry</b> prior from LiDAR in autonomous driving scenarios. Lightning NeRF significantly improves the novel view synthesis performance of NeRF and reduces computational overheads. Through evaluations on real-world datasets, such as KITTI-360, Argoverse2, and our private dataset, we demonstrate that our approach not only exceeds the current state-of-the-art in novel view synthesis quality but also achieves a five-fold increase in training speed and a ten-fold improvement in rendering speed. Codes are available at https://github.com/VISION-SJTU/Lightning-NeRF .

**ABSTRACT**  
Under-Display Camera (UDC) is an emerging technology that achieves full-screen display via hiding the camera under the display panel. However, the current implementation of UDC causes serious degradation. The incident light required for camera imaging undergoes attenuation and diffraction when passing through the display panel, leading to various artifacts in UDC imaging. Presently, the prevailing UDC image restoration methods predominantly utilize <b>convolutional</b> <b>neural</b> <b>network</b> architectures, whereas <b>Transformer-based</b> methods have exhibited superior performance in the majority of image restoration tasks. This is attributed to the <b>Transformer's</b> capability to sample global features for the local reconstruction of images, thereby achieving high-quality image restoration. In this paper, we observe that when using the <b>Vision</b> <b>Transformer</b> for UDC degraded image restoration, the global attention samples a large amount of redundant information and noise. Furthermore, compared to the ordinary <b>Transformer</b> employing dense attention, the <b>Transformer</b> utilizing sparse attention can alleviate the adverse impact of redundant information and noise. Building upon this discovery, we propose a Segmentation Guided Sparse <b>Transformer</b> method (SGSFormer) for the task of restoring high-quality images from UDC degraded images. Specifically, we utilize sparse <b>self-attention</b> to filter out redundant information and noise, directing the model's attention to focus on the features more relevant to the degraded regions in need of reconstruction. Moreover, we integrate the instance segmentation map as prior information to guide the sparse <b>self-attention</b> in filtering and focusing on the correct regions.

**ABSTRACT**  
The rigid registration of aortic Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA) and Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) can provide 3D anatomical details of the vasculature for the interventional surgical treatment of conditions such as aortic dissection and aortic aneurysms, holding significant value for clinical research. However, the current methods for 2D/3D image registration are dependent on manual annotations or synthetic data, as well as the extraction of landmarks, which is not suitable for cross-modal registration of aortic DSA/CTA. In this paper, we propose an <b>unsupervised</b> method, UDCR, for aortic DSA/CTA rigid registration based on deep <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning.</b> Leveraging the imaging principles and characteristics of DSA and CTA, we have constructed a cross-dimensional registration environment based on spatial transformations. Specifically, we propose an overlap degree calculation reward function that measures the intensity difference between the foreground and background, aimed at assessing the accuracy of registration between segmentation maps and DSA images. This method is highly flexible, allowing for the loading of pre-trained models to perform registration directly or to seek the optimal spatial transformation parameters through online learning. We manually annotated 61 pairs of aortic DSA/CTA for algorithm evaluation. The results indicate that the proposed UDCR achieved a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 2.85 mm in translation and 4.35{\deg} in rotation, showing significant potential for clinical applications.

**ABSTRACT**  
No-reference image- and video-quality metrics are widely used in video processing <b>benchmarks.</b> The robustness of learning-based metrics under video attacks has not been widely studied. In addition to having success, attacks that can be employed in video processing <b>benchmarks</b> must be fast and imperceptible. This paper introduces an Invisible One-Iteration (IOI) <b>adversarial</b> <b>attack</b> on no reference image and video quality metrics. We compared our method alongside eight prior approaches using image and video datasets via objective and subjective tests. Our method exhibited superior visual quality across various attacked metric architectures while maintaining comparable attack success and speed. We made the code available on GitHub.

**ABSTRACT**  
With the blossom of deep learning models and services, it has become an imperative concern to safeguard the valuable model parameters from being stolen. Watermarking is considered an important tool for ownership verification. However, current watermarking schemes are customized for different models and tasks, hard to be integrated as an integrated intellectual protection service. We propose Hufu, a modality-agnostic watermarking system for pre-trained <b>Transformer-based</b> models, relying on the permutation equivariance property of <b>Transformers.</b> Hufu embeds watermark by <b>fine-tuning</b> the pre-trained model on a set of data samples specifically permuted, and the embedded model essentially contains two sets of weights -- one for normal use and the other for watermark extraction which is triggered on permuted inputs. The permutation equivariance ensures minimal interference between these two sets of model weights and thus high fidelity on downstream tasks. Since our method only depends on the model itself, it is naturally modality-agnostic, task-independent, and trigger-sample-free. Extensive experiments on the state-of-the-art <b>vision</b> <b>Transformers,</b> <b>BERT,</b> and <b>GPT2</b> have demonstrated Hufu's superiority in meeting watermarking requirements including effectiveness, efficiency, fidelity, and robustness, showing its great potential to be deployed as a uniform ownership verification service for various <b>Transformers.</b>

**ABSTRACT**  
The widespread deployment of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for 3D point cloud processing starkly contrasts with their susceptibility to security breaches, notably backdoor attacks. These attacks hijack DNNs during training, embedding triggers in the data that, once activated, cause the network to make predetermined errors while maintaining normal performance on unaltered data. This vulnerability poses significant risks, especially given the insufficient research on robust defense mechanisms for 3D point cloud networks against such sophisticated threats. Existing attacks either struggle to resist basic point cloud pre-processing methods, or rely on delicate manual design. Exploring simple, effective, imperceptible, and difficult-to-defend triggers in 3D point clouds is still challenging.To address these challenges, we introduce MirrorAttack, a novel effective 3D backdoor attack method, which implants the trigger by simply reconstructing a clean point cloud with an auto-encoder. The data-driven nature of the MirrorAttack obviates the need for complex manual design. Minimizing the <b>reconstruction</b> <b>loss</b> automatically improves imperceptibility. Simultaneously, the <b>reconstruction</b> <b>network</b> endows the trigger with pronounced nonlinearity and sample specificity, rendering traditional preprocessing techniques ineffective in eliminating it. A trigger smoothing module based on spherical harmonic transformation is also attached to regulate the intensity of the attack.Both quantitive and qualitative results verify the effectiveness of our method. We achieve state-of-the-art <b>ASR</b> on different types of victim models with the intervention of defensive techniques. Moreover, the minimal perturbation introduced by our trigger, as assessed by various metrics, attests to the method's stealth, ensuring its imperceptibility.

**ABSTRACT**  
Designing secure information infrastructure is a function of design and usability. However, security is seldom given priority when systems are being developed. Secure design practices should balance between functionality (i.e., proper design) to meet minimum requirements and user-friendliness. Design <b>recommendations</b> such as those with a user-centric approach (i.e., inclusive of only relevant information, user liberty) and presenting information within its proper context in a clear and engaging manner has been scientifically shown to improve user response and experience.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this paper, we introduce a privacy-preserving stable <b>diffusion</b> <b>framework</b> leveraging homomorphic encryption, called HE-Diffusion, which primarily focuses on protecting the denoising phase of the <b>diffusion</b> <b>process.</b> HE-Diffusion is a tailored encryption framework specifically designed to align with the unique architecture of stable <b>diffusion,</b> <b>ensuring</b> both privacy and functionality. To address the inherent computational challenges, we propose a novel min-distortion method that enables efficient partial image encryption, significantly reducing the overhead without compromising the model's output quality. Furthermore, we adopt a sparse tensor representation to expedite computational operations, enhancing the overall efficiency of the privacy-preserving <b>diffusion</b> <b>process.</b> We successfully implement HE-based privacy-preserving stable <b>diffusion</b> <b>inference.</b> The experimental results show that HE-Diffusion achieves 500 times speedup compared with the baseline method, and reduces time cost of the homomorphically encrypted inference to the minute level. Both the performance and accuracy of the HE-Diffusion are on par with the plaintext counterpart. Our approach marks a significant step towards integrating advanced cryptographic techniques with state-of-the-art generative models, paving the way for privacy-preserving and efficient image generation in critical applications.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recently, there has been a growing interest in leveraging pre-trained <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> <b>(LLMs)</b> for various time series applications. However, the semantic space of <b>LLMs,</b> established through the pre-training, is still underexplored and may help yield more distinctive and informative representations to facilitate time series forecasting. To this end, we propose Semantic Space Informed <b>Prompt</b> <b>learning</b> with <b>LLM</b> ($S^2$IP-LLM) to align the pre-trained semantic space with time series embeddings space and perform time series forecasting based on learned <b>prompts</b> <b>from</b> the joint space. We first design a <b>tokenization</b> module tailored for cross-modality alignment, which explicitly concatenates patches of decomposed time series components to create embeddings that effectively encode the temporal dynamics. Next, we leverage the pre-trained word token embeddings to derive semantic anchors and align selected anchors with time series embeddings by maximizing the cosine similarity in the joint space. This way, $S^2$IP-LLM can retrieve relevant semantic anchors as <b>prompts</b> <b>to</b> provide strong indicators (context) for time series that exhibit different temporal dynamics. With thorough empirical studies on multiple <b>benchmark</b> datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed $S^2$IP-LLM can achieve superior forecasting performance over state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, our ablation studies and visualizations verify the necessity of <b>prompt</b> <b>learning</b> informed by semantic space.

**ABSTRACT**  
A <b>Knowledge</b> <b>Graph</b> <b>(KG)</b> <b>is</b> a heterogeneous <b>graph</b> <b>encompassing</b> <b>a</b> diverse range of <b>node</b> <b>and</b> edge types. Heterogeneous <b>Graph</b> <b>Neural</b> <b>Networks</b> (HGNNs) are popular for training machine learning tasks like <b>node</b> <b>classification</b> and link prediction on <b>KGs.</b> However, HGNN methods exhibit excessive complexity influenced by the <b>KG's</b> size, density, and the number of <b>node</b> <b>and</b> edge types. AI practitioners handcraft a subgraph of a <b>KG</b> G relevant to a specific task. We refer to this subgraph as a task-oriented subgraph (TOSG), which contains a subset of task-related <b>node</b> <b>and</b> edge types in G. Training the task using TOSG instead of G alleviates the excessive computation required for a large <b>KG.</b> Crafting the TOSG demands a deep understanding of the <b>KG's</b> structure and the task's objectives. Hence, it is challenging and time-consuming. This paper proposes <b>KG-TOSA,</b> an approach to automate the TOSG extraction for task-oriented HGNN training on a large <b>KG.</b> In <b>KG-TOSA,</b> we define a generic <b>graph</b> <b>pattern</b> <b>that</b> captures the <b>KG's</b> local and global structure relevant to a specific task. We explore different techniques to extract subgraphs matching our <b>graph</b> <b>pattern:</b> <b>namely</b> (i) two techniques sampling around targeted <b>nodes</b> <b>using</b> biased random walk or influence scores, and (ii) a SPARQL-based extraction method leveraging RDF engines' built-in indices. Hence, it achieves negligible preprocessing overhead compared to the sampling techniques. We develop a <b>benchmark</b> of real <b>KGs</b> of large sizes and various tasks for <b>node</b> <b>classification</b> and link prediction. Our experiments show that <b>KG-TOSA</b> helps state-of-the-art HGNN methods reduce training time and memory usage by up to 70% while improving the model performance, e.g., accuracy and inference time.

**ABSTRACT**  
Fair <b>graph</b> <b>learning</b> <b>plays</b> a pivotal role in numerous practical applications. Recently, many fair <b>graph</b> <b>learning</b> <b>methods</b> have been proposed; however, their evaluation often relies on poorly constructed semi-synthetic datasets or substandard real-world datasets. In such cases, even a basic Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) can outperform <b>Graph</b> <b>Neural</b> <b>Networks</b> <b>(GNNs)</b> in both utility and <b>fairness.</b> In this work, we illustrate that many datasets fail to provide meaningful information in the edges, which may challenge the necessity of using <b>graph</b> <b>structures</b> <b>in</b> these problems. To address these issues, we develop and introduce a collection of synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world datasets that fulfill a broad spectrum of requirements. These datasets are thoughtfully designed to include relevant <b>graph</b> <b>structures</b> <b>and</b> bias information crucial for the fair evaluation of models. The proposed synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets offer the flexibility to create data with controllable bias parameters, thereby enabling the generation of desired datasets with user-defined bias values with ease. Moreover, we conduct systematic evaluations of these proposed datasets and establish a unified evaluation approach for fair <b>graph</b> <b>learning</b> <b>models.</b> Our extensive experimental results with fair <b>graph</b> <b>learning</b> <b>methods</b> across our datasets demonstrate their effectiveness in <b>benchmarking</b> the performance of these methods. Our datasets and the code for reproducing our experiments are available at https://github.com/XweiQ/Benchmark-GraphFairness.

**ABSTRACT**  
With the widespread adoption of Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) in building energy management, ensuring the high quality of NILM data has become imperative. However, practical applications of NILM face challenges associated with data loss, significantly impacting accuracy and reliability in energy management. This paper addresses the issue of NILM data loss by introducing an innovative <b>tensor</b> <b>completion(TC)</b> model- Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID)-incorporated Non-negative Latent Factorization of <b>Tensors</b> <b>(PNLFT)</b> with twofold ideas: 1) To tackle the issue of slow convergence in Latent Factorization of <b>Tensors</b> <b>(LFT)</b> using <b>Stochastic</b> <b>Gradient</b> <b>Descent</b> <b>(SGD),</b> a Proportional-Integral-Derivative controller is introduced during the learning process. The PID controller utilizes historical and current information to control learning residuals. 2) Considering the characteristics of NILM data, non-negative update rules are proposed in the model's learning scheme. Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art models, the proposed model exhibits noteworthy enhancements in both convergence speed and accuracy.

**ABSTRACT**  
We study <b>Markov</b> <b>potential</b> <b>games</b> under the infinite horizon average reward criterion. Most previous studies have been for discounted rewards. We prove that both algorithms based on independent policy gradient and independent natural policy gradient converge globally to a Nash equilibrium for the average reward criterion. To set the stage for gradient-based methods, we first establish that the average reward is a smooth function of policies and provide sensitivity bounds for the differential value functions, under certain conditions on ergodicity and the second largest eigenvalue of the underlying <b>Markov</b> <b>decision</b> <b>process</b> (MDP). We prove that three algorithms, policy gradient, proximal-Q, and natural policy gradient (NPG), converge to an $\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium with time complexity $O(\frac{1}{\epsilon^2})$, given a gradient/differential Q function oracle. When policy gradients have to be estimated, we propose an algorithm with $\tilde{O}(\frac{1}{\min_{s,a}\pi(a|s)\delta})$ sample complexity to achieve $\delta$ approximation error w.r.t~the $\ell_2$ norm. Equipped with the estimator, we derive the first sample complexity analysis for a policy gradient ascent algorithm, featuring a sample complexity of $\tilde{O}(1/\epsilon^5)$. <b>Simulation</b> studies are presented.

**ABSTRACT**  
Analytical database providers (e.g., Redshift, Databricks, BigQuery) have rapidly added support for invoking <b>Large</b> <b>Language</b> <b>Models</b> <b>(LLMs)</b> through native user-defined functions (UDFs) to help users perform natural language tasks, such as classification, entity extraction, and translation, inside analytical workloads. For instance, an analyst might want to extract customer sentiments on millions of product reviews. However, <b>LLM</b> inference is highly expensive in both computational and economic terms: for example, an NVIDIA L4 GPU running Llama2-7B can only process 6 KB of text per second. In this paper, we explore how to optimize <b>LLM</b> inference for analytical workloads that invoke <b>LLMs</b> within relational queries. We show that relational queries present novel opportunities for accelerating <b>LLM</b> inference, including reordering rows to maximize key-value (KV) cache reuse within the <b>LLM</b> inference engine, reordering columns within a row to further increase cache reuse, and deduplicating redundant inference requests. We implement these optimizations in Apache Spark, with vLLM as the model serving backend and achieve up to 4.4x improvement in end-to-end latency on a <b>benchmark</b> of diverse <b>LLM-based</b> queries on real datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explicitly address the problem of optimizing <b>LLM</b> invocations within SQL queries.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> <b>(LLMs)</b> are susceptible to a variety of risks, from non-faithful output to biased and toxic generations. Due to several limiting factors surrounding <b>LLMs</b> (training cost, API access, data availability, etc.), it may not always be feasible to impose direct safety constraints on a deployed model. Therefore, an efficient and reliable alternative is required. To this end, we present our ongoing efforts to create and deploy a library of detectors: compact and easy-to-build classification models that provide labels for various harms. In addition to the detectors themselves, we discuss a wide range of uses for these detector models - from acting as guardrails to enabling effective AI governance. We also deep dive into inherent challenges in their development and discuss future work aimed at making the detectors more reliable and broadening their scope.

**ABSTRACT**  
We show that deep <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning</b> can maintain its ability to learn without resetting network parameters in settings where the number of gradient updates greatly exceeds the number of environment samples. Under such large update-to-data ratios, a recent study by Nikishin et al. (2022) suggested the emergence of a primacy bias, in which agents overfit early interactions and downplay later experience, impairing their ability to learn. In this work, we dissect the phenomena underlying the primacy bias. We inspect the early stages of training that ought to cause the failure to learn and find that a fundamental challenge is a long-standing acquaintance: value overestimation. Overinflated Q-values are found not only on <b>out-of-distribution</b> but also in-distribution data and can be traced to unseen action prediction propelled by optimizer momentum. We employ a simple unit-ball normalization that enables learning under large update ratios, show its efficacy on the widely used dm_control suite, and obtain strong performance on the challenging dog tasks, competitive with model-based approaches. Our results question, in parts, the prior explanation for sub-optimal learning due to overfitting on early data.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Reinforcement</b> <b>Learning</b> (RL) has increasingly become a preferred method over traditional rule-based systems in diverse <b>human-in-the-loop</b> (HITL) applications due to its adaptability to the dynamic nature of human interactions. However, integrating RL in such settings raises significant privacy concerns, as it might inadvertently expose sensitive user information. Addressing this, our paper focuses on developing PAPER-HILT, an innovative, adaptive RL strategy through exploiting an early-exit approach designed explicitly for privacy preservation in HITL environments. This approach dynamically adjusts the tradeoff between privacy protection and system utility, tailoring its operation to individual behavioral patterns and preferences. We mainly highlight the challenge of dealing with the variable and evolving nature of human behavior, which renders static privacy models ineffective. PAPER-HILT's effectiveness is evaluated through its application in two distinct contexts: Smart Home environments and Virtual Reality (VR) Smart Classrooms. The empirical results demonstrate PAPER-HILT's capability to provide a personalized equilibrium between user privacy and application utility, adapting effectively to individual user needs and preferences. On average for both experiments, utility (performance) drops by 24%, and privacy (state prediction) improves by 31%.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recently, <b>diffusion</b> <b>probabilistic</b> <b>models</b> have attracted attention in generative time series forecasting due to their remarkable capacity to generate high-fidelity samples. However, the effective utilization of their strong modeling ability in the <b>probabilistic</b> <b>time</b> series forecasting task remains an open question, partially due to the challenge of instability arising from their stochastic nature. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel Multi-Granularity Time Series <b>Diffusion</b> <b>(MG-TSD)</b> model, which achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance by leveraging the inherent granularity levels within the data as given targets at intermediate <b>diffusion</b> <b>steps</b> to guide the learning process of <b>diffusion</b> <b>models.</b> The way to construct the targets is motivated by the observation that the forward process of the <b>diffusion</b> <b>model,</b> which sequentially corrupts the data distribution to a standard normal distribution, intuitively aligns with the process of smoothing fine-grained data into a coarse-grained representation, both of which result in a gradual loss of fine distribution features. In the study, we derive a novel multi-granularity guidance <b>diffusion</b> <b>loss</b> function and propose a concise implementation method to effectively utilize coarse-grained data across various granularity levels. More importantly, our approach does not rely on additional external data, making it versatile and applicable across various domains. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate that our MG-TSD model outperforms existing time series prediction methods.

**ABSTRACT**  
We consider the hard label based <b>black</b> <b>box</b> <b>adversarial</b> <b>attack</b> setting which solely observes predicted classes from the target model. Most of the attack methods in this setting suffer from impractical number of queries required to achieve a successful attack. One approach to tackle this drawback is utilising the <b>adversarial</b> <b>transferability</b> between white box surrogate models and <b>black</b> <b>box</b> target model. However, the majority of the methods adopting this approach are soft label based to take the full advantage of zeroth order optimisation. Unlike mainstream methods, we propose a new practical setting of hard label based attack with an optimisation process guided by a pretrained surrogate model. Experiments show the proposed method significantly improves the query efficiency of the hard label based <b>black-box</b> <b>attack</b> across various target model architectures. We find the proposed method achieves approximately 5 times higher attack success rate compared to the <b>benchmarks,</b> especially at the small query budgets as 100 and 250.

**ABSTRACT**  
This work showcases our team's (The BEEGees) contributions to the 2023 George B. Moody PhysioNet Challenge. The aim was to predict neurological recovery from coma following cardiac arrest using clinical data and time-series such as multi-channel EEG and ECG signals. Our modelling approach is <b>multimodal,</b> based on two-dimensional spectrogram representations derived from numerous EEG channels, alongside the integration of clinical data and features extracted directly from EEG recordings. Our submitted model achieved a Challenge score of $0.53$ on the hidden test set for predictions made $72$ hours after return of spontaneous circulation. Our study shows the efficacy and limitations of employing <b>transfer</b> <b>learning</b> in medical classification. With regard to prospective implementation, our analysis reveals that the performance of the model is strongly linked to the selection of a decision threshold and exhibits strong variability across data splits.

**ABSTRACT**  
In recent years, there has been a growing interest in using learning-based approaches for solving combinatorial problems, either in an end-to-end manner or in conjunction with traditional optimization algorithms. In both scenarios, the challenge lies in encoding the targeted combinatorial problems into a structure compatible with the learning algorithm. Many existing works have proposed problem-specific representations, often in the form of a <b>graph,</b> <b>to</b> <b>leverage</b> the advantages of \textit{graph neural networks}. However, these approaches lack generality, as the representation cannot be easily transferred from one combinatorial problem to another one. While some attempts have been made to bridge this gap, they still offer a partial generality only. In response to this challenge, this paper advocates for progress toward a fully generic representation of combinatorial problems for learning-based approaches. The approach we propose involves constructing a <b>graph</b> <b>by</b> <b>breaking</b> down any constraint of a combinatorial problem into an abstract syntax tree and expressing relationships (e.g., a variable involved in a constraint) through the edges. Furthermore, we introduce a <b>graph</b> <b>neural</b> <b>network</b> architecture capable of efficiently learning from this representation. The tool provided operates on combinatorial problems expressed in the XCSP3 format, handling all the constraints available in the 2023 mini-track competition. Experimental results on four combinatorial problems demonstrate that our architecture achieves performance comparable to dedicated architectures while maintaining generality. Our code and trained models are publicly available at \url{https://github.com/corail-research/learning-generic-csp}.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper addresses the challenge of identifying the paths for vessels with operating routes of repetitive paths, partially repetitive paths, and new paths. We propose a spatial <b>clustering</b> approach for labeling the vessel paths by using only position information. We develop a path <b>clustering</b> framework employing two methods: a distance-based path modeling and a likelihood estimation method. The former enhances the accuracy of path <b>clustering</b> through the integration of <b>unsupervised</b> machine learning techniques, while the latter focuses on likelihood-based path modeling and introduces segmentation for a more detailed analysis. The result findings highlight the superior performance and efficiency of the developed approach, as both methods for <b>clustering</b> vessel paths into five classes achieve a perfect F1-score. The approach aims to offer valuable insights for route planning, ultimately contributing to improving safety and efficiency in maritime transportation.

**ABSTRACT**  
Machine learning requires defining one's target variable for predictions or decisions, a process that can have profound implications on <b>fairness:</b> biases are often encoded in target variable definition itself, before any data collection or training. We present an interactive simulator, FairTargetSim (FTS), that illustrates how target variable definition impacts <b>fairness.</b> FTS is a valuable tool for algorithm developers, researchers, and non-technical stakeholders. FTS uses a case study of algorithmic hiring, using real-world data and user-defined target variables. FTS is open-source and available at: http://tinyurl.com/ftsinterface.

**ABSTRACT**  
We study paycheck optimization, which examines how to allocate income in order to achieve several competing financial goals. For paycheck optimization, a quantitative methodology is missing, due to a lack of a suitable problem formulation. To deal with this issue, we formulate the problem as a utility maximization problem. The proposed formulation is able to (i) unify different financial goals; (ii) incorporate user preferences regarding the goals; (iii) handle stochastic interest rates. The proposed formulation also facilitates an end-to-end <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning</b> solution, which is implemented on a variety of problem settings.

**ABSTRACT**  
Feature selection plays a crucial role in improving predictive accuracy by identifying relevant features while filtering out irrelevant ones. This study investigates the importance of effective feature selection in enhancing the performance of classification models. By employing <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning</b> (RL) algorithms, specifically Q-learning (QL) and SARSA learning, this paper addresses the feature selection challenge. Using the Breast Cancer Coimbra dataset (BCCDS) and three normalization methods (Min-Max, l1, and l2), the study evaluates the performance of these algorithms. Results show that QL@Min-Max and SARSA@l2 achieve the highest classification accuracies, reaching 87% and 88%, respectively. This highlights the effectiveness of RL-based feature selection methods in optimizing classification tasks, contributing to improved model accuracy and efficiency.

**ABSTRACT**  
Hyperparameter selection in <b>continual</b> <b>learning</b> scenarios is a challenging and underexplored aspect, especially in practical non-stationary environments. Traditional approaches, such as grid searches with held-out validation data from all tasks, are unrealistic for building accurate lifelong learning systems. This paper aims to explore the role of hyperparameter selection in <b>continual</b> <b>learning</b> and the necessity of continually and automatically tuning them according to the complexity of the task at hand. Hence, we propose leveraging the nature of sequence task learning to improve Hyperparameter Optimization efficiency. By using the functional analysis of variance-based techniques, we identify the most crucial hyperparameters that have an impact on performance. We demonstrate empirically that this approach, agnostic to <b>continual</b> <b>scenarios</b> and strategies, allows us to speed up hyperparameters optimization continually across tasks and exhibit robustness even in the face of varying sequential task orders. We believe that our findings can contribute to the advancement of <b>continual</b> <b>learning</b> methodologies towards more efficient, robust and adaptable models for real-world applications.

**ABSTRACT**  
In the field of data mining and machine learning, commonly used classification models cannot effectively learn in unbalanced data. In order to balance the data distribution before model training, oversampling methods are often used to generate data for a small number of classes to solve the problem of classifying unbalanced data. Most of the classical oversampling methods are based on the SMOTE technique, which only focuses on the local information of the data, and therefore the generated data may have the problem of not being realistic enough. In the current oversampling methods based on generative networks, the methods based on <b>GANs</b> can capture the true distribution of data, but there is the problem of pattern collapse and training instability in training; in the oversampling methods based on denoising diffusion probability models, the neural network of the inverse diffusion process using the U-Net is not applicable to tabular data, and although the MLP can be used to replace the U-Net, the problem exists due to the simplicity of the structure and the poor effect of removing noise. problem of poor noise removal. In order to overcome the above problems, we propose a novel oversampling method SEMRes-DDPM.In the SEMRes-DDPM backward diffusion process, a new neural network structure SEMST-ResNet is used, which is suitable for tabular data and has good noise removal effect, and it can generate tabular data with higher quality. Experiments show that the SEMResNet network removes noise better than MLP; SEMRes-DDPM generates data distributions that are closer to the real data distributions than TabDDPM with CWGAN-GP; on 20 real unbalanced tabular datasets with 9 classification models, SEMRes-DDPM improves the quality of the generated tabular data in terms of three evaluation metrics (F1, G-mean, AUC) with better classification performance than other SOTA oversampling methods.

**ABSTRACT**  
In <b>Federated</b> <b>Learning</b> (FL), the data in each client is typically assumed fixed or static. However, data often comes in an incremental manner in real-world applications, where the data domain may increase dynamically. In this work, we study catastrophic forgetting with data heterogeneity in <b>Federated</b> <b>Incremental</b> Learning (FIL) scenarios where edge clients may lack enough storage space to retain full data. We propose to employ a simple, generic framework for FIL named Re-Fed, which can coordinate each client to cache important samples for replay. More specifically, when a new task arrives, each client first caches selected previous samples based on their global and local importance. Then, the client trains the local model with both the cached samples and the samples from the new task. Theoretically, we analyze the ability of Re-Fed to discover important samples for replay thus alleviating the catastrophic forgetting problem. Moreover, we empirically show that Re-Fed achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

**ABSTRACT**  
We propose a data-driven latent space dynamics identification method (tLaSDI) that embeds the first and second principles of thermodynamics. The latent variables are learned through an <b>autoencoder</b> as a nonlinear dimension reduction model. The dynamics of the latent variables are constructed by a neural network-based model that preserves certain structures to respect the thermodynamic laws through the GENERIC formalism. An abstract error estimate of the approximation is established, which provides a new loss formulation involving the Jacobian computation of <b>autoencoder.</b> Both the <b>autoencoder</b> and the latent dynamics are trained to minimize the new loss. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the performance of tLaSDI, which exhibits robust generalization ability, even in extrapolation. In addition, an intriguing correlation is empirically observed between the entropy production rates in the latent space and the behaviors of the full-state solution.

**ABSTRACT**  
Current <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> have dangerous capabilities, which are likely to become more problematic in the future. Activation steering techniques can be used to reduce risks from these capabilities. In this paper, we investigate the efficacy of activation steering for broad skills and multiple behaviours. First, by comparing the effects of reducing performance on general coding ability and Python-specific ability, we find that steering broader skills is competitive to steering narrower skills. Second, we steer models to become more or less myopic and wealth-seeking, among other behaviours. In our experiments, combining steering vectors for multiple different behaviours into one steering vector is largely unsuccessful. On the other hand, injecting individual steering vectors at different places in a model simultaneously is promising.

**ABSTRACT**  
Neural architecture search automates the design of neural network architectures usually by exploring a large and thus complex architecture search space. To advance the architecture search, we present a <b>graph</b> diffusion-based NAS approach that uses discrete conditional <b>graph</b> diffusion processes to generate high-performing neural network architectures. We then propose a multi-conditioned classifier-free guidance approach applied to <b>graph</b> diffusion networks to jointly impose constraints such as high accuracy and low hardware latency. Unlike the related work, our method is completely differentiable and requires only a single model training. In our evaluations, we show promising results on six standard <b>benchmarks,</b> yielding novel and unique architectures at a fast speed, i.e. less than 0.2 seconds per architecture. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generalisability and efficiency of our method through experiments on ImageNet dataset.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper delves into the critical area of deep learning robustness, challenging the conventional belief that classification robustness and explanation robustness in image classification systems are inherently correlated. Through a novel evaluation approach leveraging <b>clustering</b> for efficient assessment of explanation robustness, we demonstrate that enhancing explanation robustness does not necessarily flatten the input loss landscape with respect to explanation loss - contrary to flattened loss landscapes indicating better classification robustness. To deeply investigate this contradiction, a groundbreaking training method designed to adjust the loss landscape with respect to explanation loss is proposed. Through the new training method, we uncover that although such adjustments can impact the robustness of explanations, they do not have an influence on the robustness of classification. These findings not only challenge the prevailing assumption of a strong correlation between the two forms of robustness but also pave new pathways for understanding relationship between loss landscape and explanation loss.

**ABSTRACT**  
The setting of online convex optimization (OCO) under unknown constraints has garnered significant attention in recent years. In this work, we consider a version of this problem with static linear constraints that the player receives noisy feedback of and must always satisfy. By leveraging our novel design paradigm of optimistic safety, we give an algorithm for this problem that enjoys $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ regret. This improves on the previous best regret bound of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{2/3})$ while using only slightly stronger assumptions of independent noise and an oblivious adversary. Then, by recasting this problem as OCO under time-varying stochastic linear constraints, we show that our algorithm enjoys the same regret guarantees in such a setting and never violates the constraints in expectation. This contributes to the literature on OCO under time-varying stochastic constraints, where the state-of-the-art algorithms enjoy $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ regret and $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ violation when the constraints are convex and the player receives full feedback. Additionally, we provide a version of our algorithm that is more computationally efficient and give numerical experiments comparing it with <b>benchmark</b> algorithms.

**ABSTRACT**  
Understanding causal relationships between variables is a fundamental problem with broad impact in numerous scientific fields. While extensive research has been dedicated to learning causal <b>graphs</b> from data, its complementary concept of testing causal relationships has remained largely unexplored. While learning involves the task of recovering the Markov equivalence class (MEC) of the underlying causal <b>graph</b> from observational data, the testing counterpart addresses the following critical question: Given a specific MEC and observational data from some causal <b>graph,</b> can we determine if the data-generating causal <b>graph</b> belongs to the given MEC? We explore constraint-based testing methods by establishing bounds on the required number of conditional independence tests. Our bounds are in terms of the size of the maximum undirected clique ($s$) of the given MEC. In the worst case, we show a lower bound of $\exp(\Omega(s))$ independence tests. We then give an algorithm that resolves the task with $\exp(O(s))$ tests, matching our lower bound. Compared to the learning problem, where algorithms often use a number of independence tests that is exponential in the maximum in-degree, this shows that testing is relatively easier. In particular, it requires exponentially less independence tests in <b>graphs</b> featuring high in-degrees and small clique sizes. Additionally, using the DAG associahedron, we provide a geometric interpretation of testing versus learning and discuss how our testing result can aid learning.

**ABSTRACT**  
In recent times, a plethora of hardware accelerators have been put forth for <b>graph</b> <b>learning</b> applications such as vertex classification and <b>graph</b> <b>classification.</b> However, previous works have paid little attention to <b>Knowledge</b> <b>Graph</b> <b>Completion</b> (KGC), a task that is well-known for its significantly higher algorithm complexity. The state-of-the-art KGC solutions based on <b>graph</b> <b>convolution</b> neural network <b>(GCN)</b> involve extensive vertex/relation embedding updates and complicated score functions, which are inherently cumbersome for acceleration. As a result, existing accelerator designs are no longer optimal, and a novel algorithm-hardware co-design for <b>KG</b> <b>reasoning</b> is needed. Recently, brain-inspired HyperDimensional Computing (HDC) has been introduced as a promising solution for lightweight machine learning, particularly for <b>graph</b> <b>learning</b> applications. In this paper, we leverage HDC for an intrinsically more efficient and acceleration-friendly KGC algorithm. We also co-design an acceleration framework named HDReason targeting FPGA platforms. On the algorithm level, HDReason achieves a balance between high <b>reasoning</b> accuracy, strong model interpretability, and less computation complexity. In terms of architecture, HDReason offers reconfigurability, high training throughput, and low energy consumption. When compared with NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU, the proposed accelerator achieves an average 10.6x speedup and 65x energy efficiency improvement. When conducting cross-models and cross-platforms comparison, HDReason yields an average 4.2x higher performance and 3.4x better energy efficiency with similar accuracy versus the state-of-the-art FPGA-based <b>GCN</b> training platform.

**ABSTRACT**  
In the upcoming B5G/6G era, virtual reality (VR) over wireless has become a typical application, which is an inevitable trend in the development of video. However, in immersive and interactive VR experiences, VR services typically exhibit high delay, while simultaneously posing challenges for the energy consumption of local devices. To address these issues, this paper aims to improve the performance of the VR service in the edge-terminal cooperative system. Specifically, we formulate a problem of joint caching, computing, and communication VR service policy, by optimizing the weighted sum of overall VR delivery delay and energy consumption of local devices. For the purpose of designing the optimal VR service policy, the optimization problem is decoupled into three independent subproblems to be solved separately. To enhance the caching efficiency within the network, a bidirectional encoder representations from <b>transformers</b> <b>(Bert)-based</b> user interest analysis method is first proposed to characterize the content requesting behavior accurately. On the basis of this, a service cost minimum-maximization problem is formulated with consideration of performance <b>fairness</b> among users. Thereafter, the joint caching and computing scheme is derived for each user with given allocation of communication resources while a bisection-based communication scheme is acquired with the given information on joint caching and computing policy. With alternative optimization, an optimal policy for joint caching, computing and communication based on user interest can be finally obtained. <b>Simulation</b> results are presented to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed user interest-aware caching scheme and the effective of the joint caching, computing and communication optimization policy with consideration of user <b>fairness.</b>

**ABSTRACT**  
Space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGINs) enable worldwide network coverage beyond geographical limitations for users to access ubiquitous intelligence services. {\color{black}Facing global coverage and complex environments in SAGINs, edge intelligence can provision AI agents based on <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> <b>(LLMs)</b> for users via edge servers at ground base stations (BSs) or cloud data centers relayed by satellites.} As <b>LLMs</b> with billions of parameters are pre-trained on vast datasets, <b>LLM</b> agents have <b>few-shot</b> <b>learning</b> capabilities, e.g., chain-of-thought (CoT) <b>prompting</b> for complex tasks, which are challenged by limited resources in SAGINs. In this paper, we propose a joint caching and inference framework for edge intelligence to provision sustainable and ubiquitous <b>LLM</b> agents in SAGINs. We introduce "cached model-as-a-resource" for offering <b>LLMs</b> with limited context windows and propose a novel optimization framework, i.e., joint model caching and inference, to utilize cached model resources for provisioning <b>LLM</b> agent services along with communication, computing, and storage resources. We design "age of thought" (AoT) considering the CoT <b>prompting</b> of <b>LLMs,</b> and propose the least AoT cached model replacement algorithm for optimizing the provisioning cost. We propose a deep Q-network-based modified second-bid (DQMSB) auction to incentivize these network operators, which can enhance allocation efficiency while guaranteeing strategy-proofness and free from adverse selection.

**ABSTRACT**  
Semantic Communication (SC) is a novel paradigm for data transmission in 6G. However, there are several challenges posed when performing SC in 3D scenarios: 1) 3D semantic extraction; 2) Latent semantic redundancy; and 3) Uncertain channel estimation. To address these issues, we propose a <b>Generative</b> <b>AI</b> <b>Model</b> assisted 3D SC (GAM-3DSC) system. Firstly, we introduce a 3D Semantic Extractor (3DSE), which employs <b>generative</b> <b>AI</b> <b>models,</b> including Segment Anything Model (SAM) and Neural Radiance Field (NeRF), to extract key semantics from a 3D scenario based on user requirements. The extracted 3D semantics are represented as multi-perspective images of the goal-oriented 3D object. Then, we present an Adaptive Semantic Compression Model (ASCM) for encoding these multi-perspective images, in which we use a semantic encoder with two output heads to perform semantic encoding and mask redundant semantics in the latent semantic space, respectively. Next, we design a conditional <b>Generative</b> <b>adversarial</b> <b>network</b> and <b>Diffusion</b> <b>model</b> aided-Channel Estimation (GDCE) to estimate and refine the Channel State Information (CSI) of physical channels. Finally, <b>simulation</b> results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed GAM-3DSC system in effectively transmitting the goal-oriented 3D scenario.

**ABSTRACT**  
This study explores the application of the rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) technique, vital for interference mitigation in modern communication systems. It investigates the use of precoding methods in RSMA, especially in complex multiple-antenna interference channels, employing deep <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning.</b> The aim is to optimize precoders and power allocation for common and private data streams involving multiple decision-makers. A multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) framework is employed to address this complexity, where decentralized agents collectively learn to optimize actions in a continuous policy space. We also explore the challenges posed by imperfect channel side information at the transmitter. Additionally, decoding order estimation is addressed to determine the optimal decoding sequence for common and private data sequences. <b>Simulation</b> results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RSMA method based on MADDPG, achieving the upper bound in single-antenna scenarios and closely approaching theoretical limits in multi-antenna scenarios. Comparative analysis shows superiority over other techniques such as MADDPG without rate-splitting, maximal ratio transmission (MRT), zero-forcing (ZF), and leakage-based precoding methods. These findings highlight the potential of deep <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning-driven</b> RSMA in reducing interference and enhancing system performance in communication systems.

**ABSTRACT**  
It is well known that there is inherent radiation pattern distortion for the commercial base station antenna array, which usually needs three antenna sectors to cover the whole space. To eliminate pattern distortion and further enhance beamforming performance, we propose an electromagnetic hybrid beamforming (EHB) scheme based on a three-dimensional (3D) superdirective holographic antenna array. Specifically, EHB consists of antenna excitation current vectors (analog beamforming) and digital precoding matrices, where the implementation of analog beamforming involves the real-time adjustment of the radiation pattern to adapt it to the dynamic wireless environment. Meanwhile, the digital beamforming is optimized based on the channel characteristics of analog beamforming to further improve the achievable rate of communication systems. An electromagnetic channel model incorporating array radiation patterns and the mutual coupling effect is also developed to evaluate the benefits of our proposed scheme. <b>Simulation</b> results demonstrate that our proposed EHB scheme with a 3D holographic array achieves a relatively flat superdirective beamforming gain and allows for programmable focusing directions throughout the entire spatial domain. Furthermore, they also verify that the proposed scheme achieves a sum rate gain of over 150% compared to traditional beamforming algorithms.

**ABSTRACT**  
Low earth orbit (LEO) satellite communication systems have gained increasing attention as a crucial supplement to terrestrial wireless networks due to their extensive coverage area. This letter presents a novel system design for LEO satellite systems by leveraging stacked intelligent metasurface (SIM) technology. Specifically, the lightweight and energy-efficient SIM is mounted on a satellite to achieve multiuser beamforming directly in the electromagnetic wave domain, which substantially reduces the processing delay and computational load of the satellite compared to the traditional digital beamforming scheme. To overcome the challenges of obtaining instantaneous channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter and maximize the system's performance, a joint power allocation and SIM phase shift optimization problem for maximizing the ergodic sum rate is formulated based on statistical CSI, and an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm is customized to solve it efficiently. Additionally, a user grouping method based on channel correlation and an antenna selection algorithm are proposed to further improve the system performance. <b>Simulation</b> results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SIM-based LEO satellite system design and statistical CSI-based AO algorithm.

**ABSTRACT**  
We see that <b>convolutional</b> coding/Viterbi decoding has the structure of the Kalman filter (or the linear minimum variance filter). First, we calculate the covariance matrix of the innovation (i.e., the soft-decision input to the main decoder in a Scarce-State-Transition (SST) Viterbi decoder). Then a covariance matrix corresponding to that of the one-step prediction error in the Kalman filter is obtained. Furthermore, from that matrix, a covariance matrix corresponding to that of the filtering error in the Kalman filter is derived using the formula in the Kalman filter. As a result, the average <b>mutual</b> <b>information</b> per branch for Viterbi decoding of <b>convolutional</b> codes is given using these covariance matrices. Also, the trace of the latter matrix represents the linear minimum mean-square error (LMMSE). We show that an approximate value of the average <b>mutual</b> <b>information</b> is sandwiched between half the SNR times the average filtering and one-step prediction LMMSEs. In the case of QLI codes, from the covariance matrix of the soft-decision input to the main decoder, we can get a matrix. We show that the trace of this matrix has some connection with the linear smoothing error.

**ABSTRACT**  
Emerging technologies, such as holographic multiple-input multiple-output (HMIMO) and stacked intelligent metasurface (SIM), are driving the development of wireless communication systems. Specifically, the SIM is physically constructed by stacking multiple layers of metasurfaces and has an architecture similar to an artificial neural network (ANN), which can flexibly manipulate the electromagnetic waves that propagate through it at the speed of light. This architecture enables the SIM to achieve HMIMO precoding and combining in the wave domain, thus significantly reducing the hardware cost and energy consumption. In this letter, we investigate the channel estimation problem in SIM-assisted multi-user HMIMO communication systems. Since the number of antennas at the base station (BS) is much smaller than the number of meta-atoms per layer of the SIM, it is challenging to acquire the channel state information (CSI) in SIM-assisted multi-user systems. To address this issue, we collect multiple copies of the uplink pilot signals that propagate through the SIM. Furthermore, we leverage the array <b>geometry</b> to identify the subspace that spans arbitrary spatial correlation matrices. Based on partial CSI about the channel statistics, a pair of subspace-based channel estimators are proposed. Additionally, we compute the mean square error (MSE) of the proposed channel estimators and optimize the phase shifts of the SIM to minimize the MSE. Numerical results are illustrated to analyze the effectiveness of the proposed channel estimation schemes.

**ABSTRACT**  
Autonomous robots in endovascular interventions possess the potential to navigate guidewires with safety and reliability, while reducing human error and shortening surgical time. However, current methods of guidewire navigation based on <b>Reinforcement</b> <b>Learning</b> (RL) depend on manual demonstration data or magnetic guidance. In this work, we propose an Image-guided Autonomous Guidewire Navigation (IAGN) method. Specifically, we introduce BDA-star, a path planning algorithm with boundary distance constraints, for the trajectory planning of guidewire navigation. We established an IAGN-RL environment where the observations are real-time guidewire feeding images highlighting the position of the guidewire tip and the planned path. We proposed a reward function based on the distances from both the guidewire tip to the planned path and the target to evaluate the agent's actions. Furthermore, in policy network, we employ a pre-trained <b>convolutional</b> <b>neural</b> <b>network</b> to extract features, mitigating stability issues and slow convergence rates associated with direct learning from raw pixels. Experiments conducted on the aortic <b>simulation</b> IAGN platform demonstrated that the proposed method, targeting the left subclavian artery and the brachiocephalic artery, achieved a 100% guidewire navigation success rate, along with reduced movement and retraction distances and trajectories tend to the center of the vessels.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this technical report, we compare treating an IMU as an input to a motion model against treating it as a measurement of the state in a <b>continuous-time</b> <b>state</b> estimation framework. Treating IMU measurements as inputs to a motion model and then preintegrating these measurements has almost become a de-facto standard in many robotics applications. However, this approach has a few shortcomings. First, it conflates the IMU measurement noise with the underlying process noise. Second, it is unclear how the state will be propagated in the case of IMU measurement dropout. Third, it does not lend itself well to dealing with multiple high-rate sensors such as a lidar and an IMU or multiple IMUs. In this work, we methodically compare the performance of these two approaches on a 1D <b>simulation</b> and show that they perform identically, assuming that each method's hyperparameters have been tuned on a training set. We show how to preintegrate heterogeneous factors using <b>Gaussian</b> <b>process</b> interpolation. We also provide results for our <b>continuous-time</b> <b>lidar-inertial</b> odometry in <b>simulation</b> and on the Newer College Dataset. Code for our lidar-inertial odometry can be found at: https://github.com/utiasASRL/steam_icp

**ABSTRACT**  
In this paper, we discuss the development and deployment of a robust autonomous system capable of performing various tasks in the maritime domain under unknown dynamic conditions. We investigate a data-driven approach based on modular design for ease of transfer of autonomy across different maritime surface vessel platforms. The data-driven approach alleviates issues related to a priori identification of system models that may become deficient under evolving system behaviors or shifting, unanticipated, environmental influences. Our proposed learning-based platform comprises a deep Koopman system model and a change point detector that provides guidance on domain shifts <b>prompting</b> relearning under severe exogenous and endogenous perturbations. Motion control of the autonomous system is achieved via an optimal controller design. The Koopman linearized model naturally lends itself to a linear-quadratic regulator (LQR) control design. We propose the C3D control architecture Cascade Control with Change Point Detection and Deep Koopman Learning. The framework is verified in station keeping task on an ASV in both <b>simulation</b> and real experiments. The approach achieved at least 13.9 percent improvement in mean distance error in all test cases compared to the methods that do not consider system changes.

**ABSTRACT**  
Collision detection via visual fences can significantly enhance the safety of collaborative robotic arms. Existing work typically performs such detection based on pre-deployed stationary cameras outside the robotic arm's workspace. These stationary cameras can only provide a restricted detection range and constrain the mobility of the robotic system. To cope with this issue, we propose an active sense method enabling a wide range of collision risk evaluation in dynamic scenarios. First, an active vision mechanism is implemented by equipping cameras with additional degrees of rotation. Considering the uncertainty in the active sense, we design a state confidence envelope to uniformly characterize both known and potential dynamic obstacles. Subsequently, using the observation-based uncertainty evolution, collision risk is evaluated by the prediction of obstacle envelopes. On this basis, a <b>Markov</b> <b>decision</b> <b>process</b> was employed to search for an optimal observation sequence of the active sense system, which enlarges the field of observation and reduces uncertainties in the state estimation of surrounding obstacles. <b>Simulation</b> and real-world experiments consistently demonstrate a 168% increase in the observation time coverage of typical dynamic humanoid obstacles compared to the method using stationary cameras, which underscores our system's effectiveness in collision risk tracking and enhancing the safety of robotic arms.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper studies <b>Reinforcement</b> <b>Learning</b> (RL) techniques to enable team coordination behaviors in <b>graph</b> environments with support actions among teammates to reduce the costs of traversing certain risky edges in a centralized manner. While classical approaches can solve this non-standard multi-agent path planning problem by converting the original Environment <b>Graph</b> (EG) into a Joint State <b>Graph</b> (JSG) to implicitly incorporate the support actions, those methods do not scale well to large <b>graphs</b> and teams. To address this curse of dimensionality, we propose to use RL to enable agents to learn such <b>graph</b> traversal and teammate supporting behaviors in a data-driven manner. Specifically, through a new formulation of the team coordination on <b>graphs</b> with risky edges problem into Markov Decision Processes <b>(MDPs)</b> with a novel state and action space, we investigate how RL can solve it in two paradigms: First, we use RL for a team of agents to learn how to coordinate and reach the goal with minimal cost on a single EG. We show that RL efficiently solves problems with up to 20/4 or 25/3 nodes/agents, using a fraction of the time needed for JSG to solve such complex problems; Second, we learn a general RL policy for any $N$-node EGs to produce efficient supporting behaviors. We present extensive experiments and compare our RL approaches against their classical counterparts.

**ABSTRACT**  
Constrained Motion Planning (CMP) aims to find a collision-free path between the given start and goal configurations on the kinematic constraint manifolds. These problems appear in various scenarios ranging from object manipulation to legged-robot locomotion. However, the zero-volume nature of manifolds makes the CMP problem challenging, and the state-of-the-art methods still take several seconds to find a path and require a computationally expansive path dataset for imitation learning. Recently, physics-informed motion planning methods have emerged that directly solve the Eikonal equation through neural networks for motion planning and do not require expert demonstrations for learning. Inspired by these approaches, we propose the first physics-informed CMP framework that solves the Eikonal equation on the constraint manifolds and trains neural function for CMP without expert data. Our results show that the proposed approach efficiently solves various CMP problems in both <b>simulation</b> and real-world, including object manipulation under orientation constraints and door opening with a high-dimensional 6-DOF robot manipulator. In these complex settings, our method exhibits high success rates and finds paths in sub-seconds, which is many times faster than the state-of-the-art CMP methods.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Data-driven</b> <b>methods</b> have great advantages in modeling complicated human behavioral dynamics and dealing with many human-robot interaction applications. However, collecting massive and annotated real-world human datasets has been a laborious task, especially for highly interactive scenarios. On the other hand, algorithmic <b>data</b> <b>generation</b> methods are usually limited by their model capacities, making them unable to offer realistic and diverse <b>data</b> <b>needed</b> by various application users. In this work, we study trajectory-level <b>data</b> <b>generation</b> for multi-human or human-robot interaction scenarios and propose a learning-based automatic trajectory generation model, which we call Multi-Agent TRajectory generation with dIverse conteXts (MATRIX). MATRIX is capable of generating interactive human behaviors in realistic diverse contexts. We achieve this goal by modeling the explicit and interpretable objectives so that MATRIX can generate human motions based on diverse destinations and heterogeneous behaviors. We carried out extensive comparison and ablation studies to illustrate the effectiveness of our approach across various metrics. We also presented experiments that demonstrate the capability of MATRIX to serve as <b>data</b> <b>augmentation</b> for imitation-based motion planning.

**ABSTRACT**  
Multi-robot belief space planning (MR-BSP) is essential for reliable and safe autonomy. While planning, each robot maintains a belief over the state of the environment and reasons how the belief would evolve in the future for different candidate actions. Yet, existing MR-BSP works have a common assumption that the beliefs of different robots are consistent at planning time. Such an assumption is often highly unrealistic, as it requires prohibitively extensive and frequent communication capabilities. In practice, each robot may have a different belief about the state of the environment. Crucially, when the beliefs of different robots are inconsistent, state-of-the-art MR-BSP approaches could result in a lack of coordination between the robots, and in general, could yield dangerous, unsafe and sub-optimal decisions. In this paper, we tackle this crucial gap. We develop a novel decentralized algorithm that is guaranteed to find a consistent joint action. For a given robot, our algorithm reasons for action preferences about 1) its local information, 2) what it perceives about the <b>reasoning</b> of the other robot, and 3) what it perceives about the <b>reasoning</b> of itself perceived by the other robot. This algorithm finds a consistent joint action whenever these steps yield the same best joint action obtained by <b>reasoning</b> about action preferences; otherwise, it self-triggers communication between the robots. Experimental results show efficacy of our algorithm in comparison with two baseline algorithms.

**ABSTRACT**  
Open-source development has revolutionized the software industry by promoting collaboration, transparency, and community-driven innovation. Today, a vast amount of various kinds of open-source software, which form networks of repositories, is often hosted on GitHub - a popular software development platform. To enhance the discoverability of the repository networks, i.e., groups of similar repositories, GitHub introduced repository topics in 2017 that enable users to more easily explore relevant projects by type, technology, and more. It is thus crucial to accurately assign topics for each GitHub repository. Current methods for automatic topic <b>recommendation</b> rely heavily on <b>TF-IDF</b> for encoding textual data, presenting challenges in understanding semantic nuances. This paper addresses the limitations of existing techniques by proposing Legion, a novel approach that leverages <b>Pre-trained</b> <b>Language</b> <b>Models</b> (PTMs) for recommending topics for GitHub repositories. The key novelty of Legion is three-fold. First, Legion leverages the extensive capabilities of PTMs in language understanding to capture contextual information and semantic meaning in GitHub repositories. Second, Legion overcomes the challenge of long-tailed distribution, which results in a bias toward popular topics in PTMs, by proposing a Distribution-Balanced Loss (DB Loss) to better train the PTMs. Third, Legion employs a filter to eliminate vague <b>recommendations,</b> thereby improving the precision of PTMs. Our empirical evaluation on a <b>benchmark</b> dataset of real-world GitHub repositories shows that Legion can improve vanilla PTMs by up to 26% on recommending GitHubs topics. Legion also can suggest GitHub topics more precisely and effectively than the state-of-the-art baseline with an average improvement of 20% and 5% in terms of Precision and F1-score, respectively.

**ABSTRACT**  
We present Tarski, a tool for specifying configurable trace semantics to facilitate automated <b>reasoning</b> about traces. Software development projects require that various types of traces be modeled between and within development artifacts. For any given artifact (e.g., requirements, architecture models and source code), Tarski allows the user to specify new trace types and their configurable semantics, while, using the semantics, it automatically infers new traces based on existing traces provided by the user, and checks the consistency of traces. It has been evaluated on three industrial case studies in the automotive domain (https://modelwriter.github.io/Tarski/).

**ABSTRACT**  
Software undergoes constant changes to support new requirements, address bugs, enhance performance, and ensure maintainability. Thus, developers spend a great portion of their workday trying to understand and review the code changes of their teammates. Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) diff tools were developed to overcome the limitations of line-based diff tools, which are used by the majority of developers. Despite the notable improvements brought by AST diff tools in understanding complex changes, they still suffer from serious limitations, such as (1) lacking multi-mapping support, (2) matching semantically incompatible AST nodes, (3) ignoring language clues to guide the matching process, (4) lacking refactoring awareness, and (5) lacking commit-level diff support. We propose a novel AST diff tool based on RefactoringMiner that resolves all aforementioned limitations. First, we improved RefactoringMiner to increase its statement mapping accuracy, and then we developed an algorithm that generates AST diff for a given commit or pull request based on the refactoring instances and pairs of matched program element declarations provided by RefactoringMiner. To evaluate the accuracy of our tool and compare it with the state-of-the-art tools, we created the first <b>benchmark</b> of AST node mappings, including 800 bug-fixing commits and 188 refactoring commits. Our evaluation showed that our tool achieved a considerably higher precision and recall, especially for refactoring commits, with an execution time that is comparable with that of the faster tools.

**ABSTRACT**  
Content creators increasingly utilize <b>generative</b> <b>artificial</b> intelligence (Gen-AI) on platforms such as YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and various blogging sites to produce imaginative images, AI-generated videos, and articles using <b>Large</b> <b>Language</b> <b>Models</b> <b>(LLMs).</b> Despite its growing popularity, there remains an underexplored area concerning the specific domains where AI-generated content is being applied, and the methodologies content creators employ with Gen-AI tools during the creation process. This study initially explores this emerging area through a qualitative analysis of 68 YouTube videos demonstrating Gen-AI usage. Our research focuses on identifying the content domains, the variety of tools used, the activities performed, and the nature of the final products generated by Gen-AI in the context of user-generated content.

**ABSTRACT**  
As AI assistance is increasingly infused into decision-making processes, we may seek to optimize human-centric objectives beyond decision accuracy, such as skill improvement or task enjoyment of individuals interacting with these systems. With this aspiration in mind, we propose <b>offline</b> <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning</b> (RL) as a general approach for modeling human-AI decision-making to optimize such human-centric objectives. Our approach seeks to optimize different objectives by adaptively providing decision support to humans -- the right type of assistance, to the right person, at the right time. We instantiate our approach with two objectives: human-AI accuracy on the decision-making task and human learning about the task, and learn policies that optimize these two objectives from previous human-AI interaction data. We compare the optimized policies against various baselines in AI-assisted decision-making. Across two experiments (N = 316 and N = 964), our results consistently demonstrate that people interacting with policies optimized for accuracy achieve significantly better accuracy -- and even human-AI complementarity -- compared to those interacting with any other type of AI support. Our results further indicate that human learning is more difficult to optimize than accuracy, with participants who interacted with learning-optimized policies showing significant learning improvement only at times. Our research (1) demonstrates <b>offline</b> <b>RL</b> <b>to</b> be a promising approach to model dynamics of human-AI decision-making, leading to policies that may optimize various human-centric objectives and provide novel insights about the AI-assisted decision-making space, and (2) emphasizes the importance of considering human-centric objectives beyond decision accuracy in AI-assisted decision-making, while also opening up the novel research challenge of optimizing such objectives.

**ABSTRACT**  
Visual analytics supports data analysis tasks within complex domain problems. However, due to the richness of data types, visual designs, and interaction designs, users need to recall and process a significant amount of information when they visually analyze data. These challenges emphasize the need for more intelligent visual analytics methods. <b>Large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> have demonstrated the ability to interpret various forms of textual data, offering the potential to facilitate intelligent support for visual analytics. We propose LEVA, a framework that uses <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> to enhance users' VA workflows at multiple stages: onboarding, exploration, and <b>summarization.</b> To support onboarding, we use <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> to interpret visualization designs and view relationships based on system specifications. For exploration, we use <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> to recommend insights based on the analysis of system status and data to facilitate mixed-initiative exploration. For <b>summarization,</b> we present a selective reporting strategy to retrace analysis history through a stream visualization and generate insight reports with the help of <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models.</b> We demonstrate how LEVA can be integrated into existing visual analytics systems. Two usage scenarios and a user study suggest that LEVA effectively aids users in conducting visual analytics.

**ABSTRACT**  
Companies, organizations, and governments across the world are eager to employ so-called 'AI' (artificial intelligence) technology in a broad range of different products and systems. The promise of this cause c\'el\`ebre is that the technologies offer increased automation, efficiency, and productivity - meanwhile, critics sound warnings of illusions of objectivity, pollution of our information ecosystems, and reproduction of biases and discriminatory outcomes. This paper explores patterns of motivation in the general population for trusting (or distrusting) 'AI' systems. Based on a survey with more than 450 respondents from more than 30 different countries (and about 3000 open text answers), this paper presents a qualitative analysis of current opinions and thoughts about 'AI' technology, focusing on reasons for trusting such systems. The different reasons are synthesized into four rationales (lines of <b>reasoning):</b> the Human favoritism rationale, the <b>Black</b> <b>box</b> rationale, the OPSEC rationale, and the 'Wicked world, tame computers' rationale. These rationales provide insights into human motivation for trusting 'AI' which could be relevant for developers and designers of such systems, as well as for scholars developing measures of trust in technological systems.

**ABSTRACT**  
Social media users may perceive moderation decisions by the platform differently, which can lead to frustration and dropout. This study investigates users' perceived justice and <b>fairness</b> of online moderation decisions when they are exposed to various illegal versus legal scenarios, retributive versus restorative moderation strategies, and user-moderated versus commercially moderated platforms. We conduct an online experiment on 200 American social media users of Reddit and Twitter. Results show that retributive moderation delivers higher justice and <b>fairness</b> for commercially moderated than for user-moderated platforms in illegal violations; restorative moderation delivers higher <b>fairness</b> for legal violations than illegal ones. We discuss the opportunities for platform policymaking to improve moderation system design.

**ABSTRACT**  
It is well known that ignoring the presence of stochastic disturbances in the identification of stochastic Wiener models leads to asymptotically biased estimators. On the other hand, optimal statistical identification, via likelihood-based methods, is sensitive to the assumptions on the data distribution and is usually based on relatively complex sequential Monte Carlo algorithms. We develop a simple recursive online estimation algorithm based on an output-error predictor, for the identification of <b>continuous-time</b> <b>stochastic</b> parametric Wiener models through stochastic approximation. The method is applicable to generic model parameterizations and, as demonstrated in the numerical <b>simulation</b> examples, it is robust with respect to the assumptions on the spectrum of the disturbance process.

**ABSTRACT**  
Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are highly flexible predictive models. However, reliably quantifying uncertainty for their predictions is a continuing challenge. There has been much recent work on "recalibration" of predictive distributions for ANNs, so that forecast probabilities for events of interest are consistent with certain frequency evaluations of them. Uncalibrated probabilistic forecasts are of limited use for many important decision-making tasks. To address this issue, we propose a localized recalibration of ANN predictive distributions using the dimension-reduced representation of the input provided by the ANN hidden layers. Our novel method draws inspiration from recalibration techniques used in the literature on approximate Bayesian computation and likelihood-free inference methods. Most existing calibration methods for ANNs can be thought of as calibrating either on the input layer, which is difficult when the input is high-dimensional, or the output layer, which may not be sufficiently flexible. Through a <b>simulation</b> study, we demonstrate that our method has good performance compared to alternative approaches, and explore the benefits that can be achieved by localizing the calibration based on different layers of the network. Finally, we apply our proposed method to a diamond price prediction problem, demonstrating the potential of our approach to improve prediction and uncertainty quantification in real-world applications.

This paper contributes a formal framework for quantitative analysis of bounded sensor attacks on cyber-physical systems, using the formalism of differential dynamic logic. Given a precondition and postcondition of a system, we formalize two quantitative safety notions, quantitative forward and backward safety, which respectively express (1) how strong the strongest postcondition of the system is with respect to the specified postcondition, and (2) how strong the specified precondition is with respect to the weakest precondition of the system needed to ensure the specified postcondition holds. We introduce two notions, forward and backward robustness, to characterize the robustness of a system against sensor attacks as the loss of safety. To reason about robustness, we introduce two <b>simulation</b> distances, forward and backward <b>simulation</b> distances, which are defined based on the behavioral distances between the original system and the system with compromised sensors. Forward and backward distances, respectively, characterize upper bounds of the degree of forward and backward safety loss caused by the sensor attacks. We verify the two <b>simulation</b> distances by expressing them as modalities, i.e., formulas of differential dynamic logic, and develop an ad-hoc proof system to reason with such formulas. We showcase our formal notions and <b>reasoning</b> techniques on two non-trivial case studies: an autonomous vehicle that needs to avoid collision and a water tank system.

**ABSTRACT**  
When deployed in the real world, safe control methods must be robust to unstructured uncertainties such as modeling error and external disturbances. Typical approaches either leverage worst-case uncertainty bounds to provide safety guarantees for an expanded (overly conservative) safe set or synthesize controllers that always assume the worst-case disturbance will occur. In contrast, this paper utilizes Freedman's inequality in the context of <b>discrete-time</b> <b>control</b> barrier functions (DTCBFs) to provide stronger (less conservative) safety guarantees for stochastic systems. Our approach accounts for the underlying disturbance distribution instead of relying exclusively on its worst-case bound and does not require the barrier function to be upper-bounded, which makes the resulting safety probability bounds more directly useful for intuitive constraints such as signed distance. We compare our results with existing safety guarantees, such as Input-to-State-Safety (ISSf) and martingale results that rely on Ville's inequality. When the assumptions for all methods hold, we provide a range of parameters for which our guarantee is less conservative. Finally, we present <b>simulation</b> examples, including a bipedal walking robot, that demonstrate the utility and tightness of our safety guarantee.

**ABSTRACT**  
Faults on electrical power lines could severely compromise both the reliability and safety of power systems, leading to unstable power delivery and increased outage risks. They pose significant safety hazards, necessitating swift detection and mitigation to maintain electrical infrastructure integrity and ensure continuous power supply. Hence, accurate detection and categorization of electrical faults are pivotal for optimized power system maintenance and operation. In this work, we propose a novel approach for detecting and categorizing electrical faults using the Hessian locally linear embedding (HLLE) technique and subsequent <b>clustering</b> with t-SNE (t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding) and Gaussian mixture model (GMM). First, we employ HLLE to transform high-dimensional (HD) electrical data into low-dimensional (LD) embedding coordinates. This technique effectively captures the inherent variations and patterns in the data, enabling robust feature extraction. Next, we perform the Mann-Whitney U test based on the feature space of the embedding coordinates for fault detection. This statistical approach allows us to detect electrical faults providing an efficient means of system monitoring and control. Furthermore, to enhance fault categorization, we employ t-SNE with GMM to cluster the detected faults into various categories. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we conduct extensive <b>simulations</b> on an electrical system integrated with solar farm. Our results demonstrate that the proposed approach exhibits effective fault detection and <b>clustering</b> across a range of fault types with different variations of the same fault. Overall, this research presents an effective methodology for robust fault detection and categorization in electrical systems, contributing to the advancement of fault management practices and the prevention of system failures.

**ABSTRACT**  
The rigorous safety verification of control systems in critical applications is essential, given their increasing complexity and integration into everyday life. <b>Simulation-based</b> falsification approaches play a pivotal role in the safety verification of control systems, particularly within critical applications. These methods systematically explore the operational space of systems to identify configurations that result in violations of safety specifications. However, the effectiveness of traditional <b>simulation-based</b> falsification is frequently limited by the high dimensionality of the search space and the substantial computational resources required for exhaustive exploration. This paper presents BEACON, a novel framework that enhances the falsification process through a combination of Bayesian optimization and covariance matrix adaptation evolutionary strategy. By exploiting quantitative metrics to evaluate how closely a system adheres to safety specifications, BEACON advances the state-of-the-art in testing methodologies. It employs a model-based test point selection approach, designed to facilitate exploration across dynamically evolving search zones to efficiently uncover safety violations. Our findings demonstrate that BEACON not only locates a higher percentage of counterexamples compared to standalone BO but also achieves this with significantly fewer <b>simulations</b> than required by CMA-ES, highlighting its potential to optimize the verification process of control systems. This framework offers a promising direction for achieving thorough and resource-efficient safety evaluations, ensuring the reliability of control systems in critical applications.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this letter, we present an approach for learning human driving behavior, without relying on specific model structures or prior distributions, in a mixed-traffic environment where connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) coexist with human-driven vehicles (HDVs). We employ conformal prediction to obtain theoretical safety guarantees and use real-world traffic data to validate our approach. Then, we design a controller that ensures effective merging of CAVs with HDVs with safety guarantees. We provide numerical <b>simulations</b> to illustrate the efficacy of the control approach.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this paper, we study the problem of ensuring safety with a few shots of samples for partially unknown systems. We first characterize a fundamental limit when producing safe actions is not possible due to insufficient information or samples. Then, we develop a technique that can generate provably safe actions and recovery behaviors using a minimum number of samples. In the performance analysis, we also establish Nagumos theorem - like results with relaxed assumptions, which is potentially useful in other contexts. Finally, we discuss how the proposed method can be integrated into a policy gradient algorithm to assure safety and stability with a handful of samples without stabilizing initial policies or generative models to probe safe actions.

**ABSTRACT**  
Motion systems are a vital part of many industrial processes. However, meeting the increasingly stringent demands of these systems, especially concerning precision and throughput, requires novel control design methods that can go beyond the capabilities of traditional solutions. Traditional control methods often struggle with the complexity and position-dependent effects inherent in modern motion systems, leading to compromises in performance and a laborious task of controller design. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing a novel structured feedback control auto-tuning approach for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) motion systems. By leveraging frequency response function (FRF) estimates and the linear-parameter-varying (LPV) control framework, the proposed approach automates the controller design, while providing local stability and performance guarantees. Key innovations include norm-based magnitude optimization of the sensitivity functions, an automated stability check through a novel extended factorized Nyquist criterion, a modular structured MIMO LPV controller parameterization, and a controller discretization approach which preserves the <b>continuous-time</b> <b>(CT)</b> controller parameterization. The proposed approach is validated through experiments using a state-of-the-art moving-magnet planar actuator prototype.

**ABSTRACT**  
Electrical fault classification is vital for ensuring the reliability and safety of power systems. Accurate and efficient fault classification methods are essential for timely and effective maintenance. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for effective fault classification through Grassmann manifolds, which is a non-Euclidean space that captures the intrinsic structure of high-dimensional data and offers a robust framework for feature extraction. We use simulated data for electrical distribution systems with various types of electrical faults. The proposed method involves transforming the measurement fault data into Grassmann manifold space using techniques from differential <b>geometry.</b> This transformation aids in uncovering the underlying fault patterns and reducing the computational complexity of subsequent classification steps. To achieve fault classification, we employ a machine learning technique optimized for the Grassmann manifold. The support vector machine classifier is adapted to operate within the Grassmann manifold space, enabling effective discrimination between different fault classes. The results illustrate the efficacy of the proposed Grassmann manifold-based approach for electrical fault classification which showcases its ability to accurately differentiate between various fault types.

**ABSTRACT**  
Series-parallel network topologies generally exhibit simplified dynamical behavior and avoid high combinatorial complexity. A comprehensive analysis of how flow complexity emerges with a <b>graph's</b> deviation from series-parallel topology is therefore of fundamental interest. We introduce the notion of a robust $k$-path on a directed acycylic <b>graph,</b> with increasing values of the length $k$ reflecting increasing deviations. We propose a <b>graph</b> homology with robust $k$-paths as the bases of its chain spaces. In this framework, the topological simplicity of series-parallel <b>graphs</b> translates into a triviality of higher-order chain spaces. We discuss a correspondence between the space of order-three chains and sites within the network that are susceptible to the Braess paradox, a well-known phenomenon in transportation networks. In this manner, we illustrate the utility of the proposed <b>graph</b> homology in sytematically studying the complexity of flow networks.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Distributional</b> <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning</b> (DRL), which cares about the full distribution of returns instead of just the mean, has achieved empirical success in various domains. One of the core tasks in the field of DRL is <b>distributional</b> <b>policy</b> <b>evaluation,</b> which involves estimating the return distribution $\eta^\pi$ for a given policy $\pi$. A <b>distributional</b> <b>temporal</b> <b>difference</b> (TD) algorithm has been accordingly proposed, which is an extension of the temporal difference algorithm in the classic RL literature. In the tabular case, \citet{rowland2018analysis} and \citet{rowland2023analysis} proved the asymptotic convergence of two instances of <b>distributional</b> <b>TD,</b> <b>namely</b> categorical temporal difference algorithm (CTD) and quantile temporal difference algorithm (QTD), respectively. In this paper, we go a step further and analyze the finite-sample performance of <b>distributional</b> <b>TD.</b> <b>To</b> facilitate theoretical analysis, we propose non-parametric <b>distributional</b> <b>TD</b> <b>algorithm</b> (NTD). For a $\gamma$-discounted infinite-horizon tabular <b>Markov</b> <b>decision</b> <b>process</b> with state space $S$ and action space $A$, we show that in the case of NTD we need $\wtilde O\prn{\frac{1}{\varepsilon^{2p}(1-\gamma)^{2p+2}}}$ iterations to achieve an $\varepsilon$-optimal estimator with high probability, when the estimation error is measured by the $p$-Wasserstein distance. Under some mild assumptions, $\wtilde O\prn{\frac{1}{\varepsilon^{2}(1-\gamma)^{4}}}$ iterations suffices to ensure the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance between the NTD estimator $\hat\eta^\pi$ and $\eta^\pi$ less than $\varepsilon$ with high probability. And we revisit CTD, showing that the same non-asymptotic convergence bounds hold for CTD in the case of the $p$-Wasserstein distance.

**ABSTRACT**  
Achieving high-performance computation on quantum systems presents a formidable challenge that necessitates bridging the capabilities between quantum hardware and classical computing resources. This study introduces an innovative distribution-aware Quantum-Classical-Quantum (QCQ) architecture, which integrates cutting-edge quantum software framework works with high-performance classical computing resources to address challenges in quantum <b>simulation</b> for materials and condensed matter physics. At the heart of this architecture is the seamless integration of VQE algorithms running on QPUs for efficient quantum state preparation, Tensor Network states, and QCNNs for classifying quantum states on classical hardware. For <b>benchmarking</b> quantum simulators, the QCQ architecture utilizes the cuQuantum SDK to leverage multi-GPU acceleration, integrated with PennyLane's Lightning plugin, demonstrating up to tenfold increases in computational speed for complex phase transition classification tasks compared to traditional CPU-based methods. This significant acceleration enables models such as the transverse field Ising and XXZ systems to accurately predict phase transitions with a 99.5% accuracy. The architecture's ability to distribute computation between QPUs and classical resources addresses critical bottlenecks in Quantum-HPC, paving the way for scalable quantum <b>simulation.</b> The QCQ framework embodies a synergistic combination of quantum algorithms, machine learning, and Quantum-HPC capabilities, enhancing its potential to provide transformative insights into the behavior of quantum systems across different scales. As quantum hardware continues to improve, this hybrid distribution-aware framework will play a crucial role in realizing the full potential of quantum computing by seamlessly integrating distributed quantum resources with the state-of-the-art classical computing infrastructure.

**ABSTRACT**  
Parallel Quantum Annealing is a technique to solve multiple optimization problems simultaneously. Parallel quantum annealing aims to optimize the utilization of available qubits on a quantum topology by addressing multiple independent problems in a single annealing cycle. This study provides insights into the potential and the limitations of this parallelization method. The experiments consisting of two different problems are integrated, and various problem dimensions are explored including normalization techniques using specific methods such as DWaveSampler with Default Embedding, DWaveSampler with Custom Embedding and LeapHybridSampler. This method minimizes idle qubits and holds promise for substantial speed-up, as indicated by the Time-to-Solution <b>(TTS)</b> metric, compared to traditional quantum annealing, which solves problems sequentially and may leave qubits unutilized.

**ABSTRACT**  
Asynchronous Microphone array calibration is a prerequisite for most audition robot applications. In practice, the calibration requires estimating microphone positions, time offsets, clock drift rates, and sound event locations simultaneously. The existing method proposed <b>Graph-based</b> Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping <b>(Graph-SLAM)</b> utilizing common TDOA, time difference of arrival between two microphones (TDOA-M), and odometry measurement, however, it heavily depends on the initial value. In this paper, we propose a novel TDOA, time difference of arrival between adjacent sound events (TDOA-S), combine it with TDOA-M, called hybrid TDOA, and add odometry measurement to construct <b>Graph-SLAM</b> and use the Gauss-Newton (GN) method to solve. TDOA-S is simple and efficient because it eliminates time offset without generating new variables. <b>Simulation</b> and real-world experiment results consistently show that our method is independent of microphone number, insensitive to initial values, and has better calibration accuracy and stability under various TDOA noises. In addition, the <b>simulation</b> result demonstrates that our method has a lower Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for microphone parameters, which explains the advantages of my method.

**ABSTRACT**  
Cryptocurrency is a fast-moving space, with a continuous influx of new projects every year. However, an increasing number of incidents in the space, such as hacks and security breaches, threaten the growth of the community and the development of technology. This dynamic and often tumultuous landscape is vividly mirrored and shaped by discussions within Crypto Twitter, a key digital arena where investors, enthusiasts, and skeptics converge, revealing real-time sentiments and trends through social media interactions. We present our analysis on a Twitter dataset collected during a formative period of the cryptocurrency landscape. We collected 40 million tweets using cryptocurrency-related keywords and performed a nuanced analysis that involved grouping the tweets by semantic similarity and constructing a tweet and user network. We used sentence-level embeddings and <b>autoencoders</b> to create K-means clusters of tweets and identified six groups of tweets and their topics to examine different cryptocurrency-related interests and the change in sentiment over time. Moreover, we discovered sentiment indicators that point to real-life incidents in the crypto world, such as the FTX incident of November 2022. We also constructed and analyzed different networks of tweets and users in our dataset by considering the reply and quote relationships and analyzed the largest components of each network. Our networks reveal a structure of <b>bot</b> <b>activity</b> in Crypto Twitter and suggest that they can be detected and handled using a network-based approach. Our work sheds light on the potential of social media signals to detect and understand crypto events, benefiting investors, regulators, and curious observers alike, as well as the potential for <b>bot</b> <b>detection</b> in Crypto Twitter using a network-based approach.

**ABSTRACT**  
The design optimization of ship hull form based on hydrodynamics theory and <b>simulation-based</b> design (SBD) technologies generally considers ship performance and energy efficiency performance as the design objective, which plays an important role in smart design and manufacturing of green ship. An optimal design of sustainable energy system requires multidisciplinary tools to build ships with the least resistance and energy consumption. Through a systematic approach, this paper presents the research progress of energy-efficient design of ship hull forms based on intelligent optimization techniques. We discuss different methods involved in the optimization procedure, especially the latest developments of intelligent optimization algorithms and surrogate models. Moreover, current development trends and technical challenges of multidisciplinary design optimization and surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms for ship design are further analyzed. We explore the gaps and potential future directions, so as to paving the way towards the design of the next generation of more energy-efficient ship hull form.

**ABSTRACT**  
We develop a model the dynamics of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and chondrocytes evolving in a nonwoven polyethylene terephtalate (PET) scaffold impregnated with hyaluron and supplied with a differentiation medium. The scaffold and the cells are assumed to be contained in a bioreactor with fluid perfusion. The differentiation of hMSCs into chondrocytes favors the production of extracellular matrix (ECM) and is influenced by fluid stress. The model takes deformations of ECM and PET scaffold into account. The scaffold structure is explicitly included by statistical assessment of the fibre distribution from CT images. The effective macroscopic equations are obtained by appropriate upscaling from dynamics on lower (microscopic and mesoscopic) scales and feature in the motility terms an explicit cell diffusion tensor encoding the assessed anisotropic scaffold structure. Numerical <b>simulations</b> show its influence on the overall cell and tissue dynamics.

**ABSTRACT**  
Distributed Deep Learning (DDL), as a paradigm, dictates the use of GPU-based clusters as the optimal infrastructure for training large-scale Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). However, the high cost of such resources makes them inaccessible to many users. Public cloud services, particularly Spot Virtual Machines (VMs), offer a cost-effective alternative, but their unpredictable availability poses a significant challenge to the crucial checkpointing process in DDL. To address this, we introduce DeepVM, a novel solution that recommends cost-effective cluster configurations by intelligently balancing the use of Spot and On-Demand VMs. DeepVM leverages a four-stage process that analyzes instance performance using the FLOPP (FLoating-point Operations Per Price) metric, performs architecture-level analysis with linear programming, and identifies the optimal configuration for the user-specific needs. Extensive <b>simulations</b> and real-world deployments in the AWS environment demonstrate that DeepVM consistently outperforms other policies, reducing training costs and overall makespan. By enabling cost-effective checkpointing with Spot VMs, DeepVM opens up DDL to a wider range of users and facilitates a more efficient training of complex DNNs.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this letter, we address the problem of improving the feasible domain of the solution of a decentralized control framework for coordinating connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) at signal-free intersections as the traffic volume increases. The framework provides the optimal trajectories of CAVs to cross the intersection safely without stop-and-go driving. However, as the traffic volume increases, the domain of the feasible trajectories decreases. We use concepts of numerical interpolation to identify appropriate polynomials that can serve as alternative trajectories of the CAVs, expanding the domain of the feasible CAV trajectories. We provide the conditions under which such polynomials exist. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through numerical <b>simulations.</b>

**ABSTRACT**  
Tandem mass spectrometry has played a pivotal role in advancing proteomics, enabling the analysis of protein composition in biological samples. Despite the development of various deep learning methods for identifying amino acid sequences (peptides) responsible for observed spectra, challenges persist in \emph{de novo} peptide sequencing. Firstly, prior methods struggle to identify amino acids with post-translational modifications (PTMs) due to their lower frequency in training data compared to canonical amino acids, further resulting in decreased peptide-level identification precision. Secondly, diverse types of noise and missing peaks in mass spectra reduce the reliability of training data (peptide-spectrum matches, PSMs). To address these challenges, we propose AdaNovo, a novel framework that calculates conditional <b>mutual</b> <b>information</b> (CMI) between the spectrum and each amino acid/peptide, using CMI for adaptive model training. Extensive experiments demonstrate AdaNovo's state-of-the-art performance on a 9-species <b>benchmark,</b> where the peptides in the training set are almost completely disjoint from the peptides of the test sets. Moreover, AdaNovo excels in identifying amino acids with PTMs and exhibits robustness against data noise. The supplementary materials contain the official code.

**ABSTRACT**  
We consider the problem of average consensus in a distributed system comprising a set of nodes that can exchange information among themselves. We focus on a class of algorithms for solving such a problem whereby each node maintains a state and updates it iteratively as a linear combination of the states maintained by its in-neighbors, i.e., nodes from which it receives information directly. Averaging algorithms within this class can be thought of as <b>discrete-time</b> <b>linear</b> time-varying systems without external driving inputs and whose state matrix is column stochastic. As a result, the algorithms exhibit a global invariance property in that the sum of the state variables remains constant at all times. In this paper, we report on another invariance property for the aforementioned class of averaging algorithms. This property is local to each node and reflects the conservation of certain quantities capturing an aggregate of all the values received by a node from its in-neighbors and all the values sent by said node to its out-neighbors (i.e., nodes to which it sends information directly) throughout the execution of the averaging algorithm. We show how this newly-discovered invariant can be leveraged for detecting errors while executing the averaging algorithm.

**ABSTRACT**  
Evolutionary Game Theory (EGT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are two fields that, at first glance, might seem distinct, but they have notable connections and intersections. The former focuses on the evolution of behaviors (or strategies) in a population, where individuals interact with others and update their strategies based on imitation (or social learning). The more successful a strategy is, the more prevalent it becomes over time. The latter, meanwhile, is centered on machine learning algorithms and (deep) neural networks. It is often from a single-agent perspective but increasingly involves multi-agent environments, in which intelligent agents adjust their strategies based on feedback and experience, somewhat akin to the evolutionary process yet distinct in their self-learning capacities. In light of the key components necessary to address real-world problems, including (i) learning and adaptation, (ii) cooperation and competition, (iii) robustness and stability, and altogether (iv) population dynamics of individual agents whose strategies evolve, the cross-fertilization of ideas between both fields will contribute to the advancement of mathematics of multi-agent learning systems, in particular, to the nascent domain of ``collective cooperative intelligence'' bridging evolutionary dynamics and multi-agent <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning.</b>

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper presents a novel generative probabilistic forecasting approach derived from the Wiener-Kallianpur innovation representation of nonparametric time series. Under the paradigm of generative artificial intelligence, the proposed forecasting architecture includes an <b>autoencoder</b> that transforms nonparametric multivariate random processes into canonical innovation sequences, from which future time series samples are generated according to their probability distributions conditioned on past samples. A novel deep-learning algorithm is proposed that constrains the latent process to be an independent and identically distributed sequence with matching <b>autoencoder</b> input-output conditional probability distributions. Asymptotic optimality and structural convergence properties of the proposed generative forecasting approach are established. Three applications involving highly dynamic and volatile time series in real-time market operations are considered: (i) locational marginal price forecasting for merchant storage participants, {(ii) interregional price spread forecasting for interchange markets,} and (iii) area control error forecasting for frequency regulations. Numerical studies based on market data from multiple independent system operators demonstrate superior performance against leading traditional and machine learning-based forecasting techniques under both probabilistic and point forecast metrics.

**ABSTRACT**  
E-commerce platforms typically store and structure product information and search data in a hierarchy. Efficiently categorizing user search queries into a similar hierarchical structure is paramount in enhancing user experience on e-commerce platforms as well as news curation and academic research. The significance of this task is amplified when dealing with sensitive query categorization or critical information dissemination, where inaccuracies can lead to considerable negative impacts. The inherent complexity of hierarchical query classification is compounded by two primary challenges: (1) the pronounced class imbalance that skews towards dominant categories, and (2) the inherent brevity and ambiguity of search queries that hinder accurate classification. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework that leverages hierarchical information through (i) enhanced <b>representation</b> <b>learning</b> that utilizes the contrastive loss to discern fine-grained instance relationships within the hierarchy, called ''instance hierarchy'', and (ii) a nuanced hierarchical classification loss that attends to the intrinsic label taxonomy, named ''label hierarchy''. Additionally, based on our observation that certain unlabeled queries share typographical similarities with labeled queries, we propose a neighborhood-aware sampling technique to intelligently select these unlabeled queries to boost the classification performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method is better than state-of-the-art (SOTA) on the proprietary Amazon dataset, and comparable to SOTA on the public datasets of Web of Science and RCV1-V2. These results underscore the efficacy of our proposed solution, and pave the path toward the next generation of hierarchy-aware query classification systems.

**ABSTRACT**  
The connection between Hamiltonicity and the independence numbers of <b>graphs</b> has been a fundamental aspect of <b>Graph</b> Theory since the seminal works of the 1960s. This paper presents a novel algorithmic perspective on these classical problems. Our contributions are twofold. First, we establish that a wide array of problems in undirected <b>graphs,</b> encompassing problems such as Hamiltonian Path and Cycle, Path Cover, Largest Linkage, and Topological Minor Containment are fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) parameterized by the independence number of a <b>graph.</b> To the best of our knowledge, these results mark the first instances of FPT problems for such parameterization. Second, we extend the algorithmic scope of the Gallai-Milgram theorem. The original theorem by Gallai and Milgram, asserts that for a <b>graph</b> G with the independence number \alpha(G), the vertex set of G can be covered by at most \alpha(G) vertex-disjoint paths. We show that determining whether a <b>graph</b> can be covered by fewer than \alpha(G) - k vertex-disjoint paths is FPT parameterized by k. Notably, the independence number parameterization, which describes <b>graph's</b> density, departs from the typical flow of research in parameterized complexity, which focuses on parameters describing <b>graph's</b> sparsity, like treewidth or vertex cover.

**ABSTRACT**  
Given a bipartite <b>graph</b> $G(V= (A \cup B),E)$ with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges and a function $b \colon V \to \mathbb{Z}_+$, a $b$-matching is a subset of edges such that every vertex $v \in V$ is incident to at most $b(v)$ edges in the subset. When we are also given edge weights, the Max Weight $b$-Matching problem is to find a $b$-matching of maximum weight, which is a fundamental combinatorial optimization problem with many applications. Extending on the recent work of Zheng and Henzinger (IPCO, 2023) on standard bipartite matching problems, we develop a simple auction algorithm to approximately solve Max Weight $b$-Matching. Specifically, we present a multiplicative auction algorithm that gives a $(1 - \varepsilon)$-approximation in $O(m \varepsilon^{-1} \log \varepsilon^{-1} \log \beta)$ worst case time, where $\beta$ the maximum $b$-value. Although this is a $\log \beta$ factor greater than the current best approximation algorithm by Huang and Pettie (Algorithmica, 2022), it is considerably simpler to present, analyze, and implement.

**ABSTRACT**  
During the last decades many metaheuristics for global numerical optimization have been proposed. Among them, Basin Hopping is very simple and straightforward to implement, although rarely used outside its original Physical Chemistry community. In this work, our aim is to compare Basin Hopping, and two population variants of it, with readily available implementations of the well known metaheuristics Differential Evolution, Particle Swarm Optimization, and Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy. We perform numerical experiments using the IOH profiler environment with the BBOB test function set and two difficult real-world problems. The experiments were carried out in two different but complementary ways: by measuring the performance under a fixed budget of function evaluations and by considering a fixed target value. The general conclusion is that Basin Hopping and its newly introduced population variant are almost as good as Covariance Matrix Adaptation on the synthetic <b>benchmark</b> functions and better than it on the two hard cluster energy minimization problems. Thus, the proposed analyses show that Basin Hopping can be considered a good candidate for global numerical optimization problems along with the more established metaheuristics, especially if one wants to obtain quick and reliable results on an unknown problem.
