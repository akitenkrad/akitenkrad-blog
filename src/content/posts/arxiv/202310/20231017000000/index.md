**ABSTRACT**  
Design space exploration (DSE) for Text-to-Image (TTI) models entails navigating a vast, opaque space of possible image outputs, through a commensurately vast input space of hyperparameters and prompt text. Minor adjustments to prompt input can surface unexpectedly disparate images. How can interfaces support end-users in reliably steering prompt-space explorations towards interesting results? Our design probe, DreamSheets, supports exploration strategies with LLM-based functions for assisted prompt construction and simultaneous display of generated results, hosted in a spreadsheet interface. The flexible layout and novel generative functions enable experimentation with user-defined workflows. Two studies, a preliminary lab study and a longitudinal study with five expert artists, revealed a set of strategies participants use to tackle the challenges of TTI design space exploration, and the interface features required to support them - like using text-generation to define local "axes" of exploration. We distill these insights into a UI mockup to guide future interfaces.

**ABSTRACT**  
Query rewriting plays a vital role in enhancing conversational search by transforming context-dependent user queries into standalone forms. Existing approaches primarily leverage human-rewritten queries as labels to train query rewriting models. However, human rewrites may lack sufficient information for optimal retrieval performance. To overcome this limitation, we propose utilizing large language models (LLMs) as query rewriters, enabling the generation of informative query rewrites through well-designed instructions. We define four essential properties for well-formed rewrites and incorporate all of them into the instruction. In addition, we introduce the role of rewrite editors for LLMs when initial query rewrites are available, forming a "rewrite-then-edit" process. Furthermore, we propose distilling the rewriting capabilities of LLMs into smaller models to reduce rewriting latency. Our experimental evaluation on the QReCC dataset demonstrates that informative query rewrites can yield substantially improved retrieval performance compared to human rewrites, especially with sparse retrievers.

**ABSTRACT**  
Breast Cancer is the most common cancer among women, which is also visible in men, and accounts for more than 1 in 10 new cancer diagnoses each year. It is also the second most common cause of women who die from cancer. Hence, it necessitates early detection and tailored treatment. Early detection can provide appropriate and patient-based therapeutic schedules. Moreover, early detection can also provide the type of cyst. This paper employs class-level data augmentation, addressing the undersampled classes and raising their detection rate. This approach suggests two key components: class-level data augmentation on structure-preserving stain normalization techniques to hematoxylin and eosin-stained images and transformer-based ViTNet architecture via transfer learning for multiclass classification of breast cancer images. This merger enables categorizing breast cancer images with advanced image processing and deep learning as either benign or as one of four distinct malignant subtypes by focusing on class-level augmentation and catering to unique characteristics of each class with increasing precision of classification on undersampled classes, which leads to lower mortality rates associated with breast cancer. The paper aims to ease the duties of the medical specialist by operating multiclass classification and categorizing the image into benign or one of four different malignant types of breast cancers.

**ABSTRACT**  
Artistic style transfer aims to modify the style of the image while preserving its content. Style transfer using deep learning models has been widely studied since 2015, and most of the applications are focused on specific artists like Van Gogh, Monet, Cezanne. There are few researches and applications on traditional Chinese painting style transfer. In this paper, we will study and leverage different state-of-the-art deep generative models for Chinese painting style transfer and evaluate the performance both qualitatively and quantitatively. In addition, we propose our own algorithm that combines several style transfer models for our task. Specifically, we will transfer two main types of traditional Chinese painting style, known as "Gong-bi" and "Shui-mo" (to modern images like nature objects, portraits and landscapes.

**ABSTRACT**  
Trained on web-scale image-text pairs, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP can recognize images of common objects in a zero-shot fashion. However, it is underexplored how to use CLIP for zero-shot recognition of highly specialized concepts, e.g., species of birds, plants, and animals, for which their scientific names are written in Latin or Greek. Indeed, CLIP performs poorly for zero-shot species recognition with prompts that use scientific names, e.g., "a photo of Lepus Timidus" (which is a scientific name in Latin). Because these names are usually not included in CLIP's training set. To improve performance, prior works propose to use large-language models (LLMs) to generate descriptions (e.g., of species color and shape) and additionally use them in prompts. We find that they bring only marginal gains. Differently, we are motivated to translate scientific names (e.g., Lepus Timidus) to common English names (e.g., mountain hare) and use such in the prompts. We find that common names are more likely to be included in CLIP's training set, and prompting them achieves 2$\sim$5 times higher accuracy on benchmarking datasets of fine-grained species recognition.

**ABSTRACT**  
Driven by the large foundation models, the development of artificial intelligence has witnessed tremendous progress lately, leading to a surge of general interest from the public. In this study, we aim to assess the performance of OpenAI's newest model, GPT-4V(ision), specifically in the realm of multimodal medical diagnosis. Our evaluation encompasses 17 human body systems, including Central Nervous System, Head and Neck, Cardiac, Chest, Hematology, Hepatobiliary, Gastrointestinal, Urogenital, Gynecology, Obstetrics, Breast, Musculoskeletal, Spine, Vascular, Oncology, Trauma, Pediatrics, with images taken from 8 modalities used in daily clinic routine, e.g., X-ray, Computed Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Positron Emission Tomography (PET), Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA), Mammography, Ultrasound, and Pathology. We probe the GPT-4V's ability on multiple clinical tasks with or without patent history provided, including imaging modality and anatomy recognition, disease diagnosis, report generation, disease localisation.   Our observation shows that, while GPT-4V demonstrates proficiency in distinguishing between medical image modalities and anatomy, it faces significant challenges in disease diagnosis and generating comprehensive reports. These findings underscore that while large multimodal models have made significant advancements in computer vision and natural language processing, it remains far from being used to effectively support real-world medical applications and clinical decision-making.   All images used in this report can be found in https://github.com/chaoyi-wu/GPT-4V_Medical_Evaluation.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper investigates the zero-shot object goal visual navigation problem. In the object goal visual navigation task, the agent needs to locate navigation targets from its egocentric visual input. "Zero-shot" means that the target the agent needs to find is not trained during the training phase. To address the issue of coupling navigation ability with target features during training, we propose the Class-Independent Relationship Network (CIRN). This method combines target detection information with the relative semantic similarity between the target and the navigation target, and constructs a brand new state representation based on similarity ranking, this state representation does not include target feature or environment feature, effectively decoupling the agent's navigation ability from target features. And a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is employed to learn the relationships between different objects based on their similarities. During testing, our approach demonstrates strong generalization capabilities, including zero-shot navigation tasks with different targets and environments. Through extensive experiments in the AI2-THOR virtual environment, our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art approaches in the zero-shot object goal visual navigation task. Furthermore, we conducted experiments in more challenging cross-target and cross-scene settings, which further validate the robustness and generalization ability of our method.

**ABSTRACT**  
Most image captioning models following an autoregressive manner suffer from significant inference latency. Several models adopted a non-autoregressive manner to speed up the process. However, the vanilla non-autoregressive manner results in subpar performance, since it generates all words simultaneously, which fails to capture the relationships between words in a description. The semi-autoregressive manner employs a partially parallel method to preserve performance, but it sacrifices inference speed. In this paper, we introduce a fast and flexible framework for image captioning called BoFiCap based on bounding and filling techniques. The BoFiCap model leverages the inherent characteristics of image captioning tasks to pre-define bounding boxes for image regions and their relationships. Subsequently, the BoFiCap model fills corresponding words in each box using two-generation manners. Leveraging the box hints, our filling process allows each word to better perceive other words. Additionally, our model offers flexible image description generation: 1) by employing different generation manners based on speed or performance requirements, 2) producing varied sentences based on user-specified boxes. Experimental evaluations on the MS-COCO benchmark dataset demonstrate that our framework in a non-autoregressive manner achieves the state-of-the-art on task-specific metric CIDEr (125.6) while speeding up 9.22x than the baseline model with an autoregressive manner; in a semi-autoregressive manner, our method reaches 128.4 on CIDEr while a 3.69x speedup.

**ABSTRACT**  
Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) using only image-level labels has gained significant attention due to cost-effectiveness. Recently, Vision Transformer (ViT) based methods without class activation map (CAM) have shown greater capability in generating reliable pseudo labels than previous methods using CAM. However, the current ViT-based methods utilize max pooling to select the patch with the highest prediction score to map the patch-level classification to the image-level one, which may affect the quality of pseudo labels due to the inaccurate classification of the patches. In this paper, we introduce a novel ViT-based WSSS method named top-K pooling with patch contrastive learning (TKP-PCL), which employs a top-K pooling layer to alleviate the limitations of previous max pooling selection. A patch contrastive error (PCE) is also proposed to enhance the patch embeddings to further improve the final results. The experimental results show that our approach is very efficient and outperforms other state-of-the-art WSSS methods on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset.

**ABSTRACT**  
In the domain of point cloud registration, the coarse-to-fine feature matching paradigm has received substantial attention owing to its impressive performance. This paradigm involves a two-step process: first, the extraction of multi-level features, and subsequently, the propagation of correspondences from coarse to fine levels. Nonetheless, this paradigm exhibits two notable limitations.Firstly, the utilization of the Dual Softmax operation has the potential to promote one-to-one correspondences between superpoints, inadvertently excluding valuable correspondences. This propensity arises from the fact that a source superpoint typically maintains associations with multiple target superpoints. Secondly, it is imperative to closely examine the overlapping areas between point clouds, as only correspondences within these regions decisively determine the actual transformation. Based on these considerations, we propose {\em OAAFormer} to enhance correspondence quality. On one hand, we introduce a soft matching mechanism, facilitating the propagation of potentially valuable correspondences from coarse to fine levels. Additionally, we integrate an overlapping region detection module to minimize mismatches to the greatest extent possible. Furthermore, we introduce a region-wise attention module with linear complexity during the fine-level matching phase, designed to enhance the discriminative capabilities of the extracted features. Tests on the challenging 3DLoMatch benchmark demonstrate that our approach leads to a substantial increase of about 7\% in the inlier ratio, as well as an enhancement of 2-4\% in registration recall. =

**ABSTRACT**  
Previous studies have revealed that artificial intelligence (AI) systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Among them, model extraction attacks fool the target model by generating adversarial examples on a substitute model. The core of such an attack is training a substitute model as similar to the target model as possible, where the simulation process can be categorized in a data-dependent and data-free manner. Compared with the data-dependent method, the data-free one has been proven to be more practical in the real world since it trains the substitute model with synthesized data. However, the distribution of these fake data lacks diversity and cannot detect the decision boundary of the target model well, resulting in the dissatisfactory simulation effect. Besides, these data-free techniques need a vast number of queries to train the substitute model, increasing the time and computing consumption and the risk of exposure. To solve the aforementioned problems, in this paper, we propose a novel data-free model extraction method named SCME (Self-Contrastive Model Extraction), which considers both the inter- and intra-class diversity in synthesizing fake data. In addition, SCME introduces the Mixup operation to augment the fake data, which can explore the target model's decision boundary effectively and improve the simulating capacity. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method can yield diversified fake data. Moreover, our method has shown superiority in many different attack settings under the query-limited scenario, especially for untargeted attacks, the SCME outperforms SOTA methods by 11.43\% on average for five baseline datasets.

**ABSTRACT**  
Weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS), which aims to train segmentation models solely using image-level labels, has achieved significant attention. Existing methods primarily focus on generating high-quality pseudo labels using available images and their image-level labels. However, the quality of pseudo labels degrades significantly when the size of available dataset is limited. Thus, in this paper, we tackle this problem from a different view by introducing a novel approach called Image Augmentation with Controlled Diffusion (IACD). This framework effectively augments existing labeled datasets by generating diverse images through controlled diffusion, where the available images and image-level labels are served as the controlling information. Moreover, we also propose a high-quality image selection strategy to mitigate the potential noise introduced by the randomness of diffusion models. In the experiments, our proposed IACD approach clearly surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods. This effect is more obvious when the amount of available data is small, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.

**ABSTRACT**  
Emotion detection presents challenges to intelligent human-robot interaction (HRI). Foundational deep learning techniques used in emotion detection are limited by information-constrained datasets or models that lack the necessary complexity to learn interactions between input data elements, such as the the variance of human emotions across different contexts. In the current effort, we introduce 1) MoEmo (Motion to Emotion), a cross-attention vision transformer (ViT) for human emotion detection within robotics systems based on 3D human pose estimations across various contexts, and 2) a data set that offers full-body videos of human movement and corresponding emotion labels based on human gestures and environmental contexts. Compared to existing approaches, our method effectively leverages the subtle connections between movement vectors of gestures and environmental contexts through the use of cross-attention on the extracted movement vectors of full-body human gestures/poses and feature maps of environmental contexts. We implement a cross-attention fusion model to combine movement vectors and environment contexts into a joint representation to derive emotion estimation. Leveraging our Naturalistic Motion Database, we train the MoEmo system to jointly analyze motion and context, yielding emotion detection that outperforms the current state-of-the-art.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper introduces an innovative approach to road network generation through the utilization of a multi-modal Large Language Model (LLM). Our model is specifically designed to process aerial images of road layouts and produce detailed, navigable road networks within the input images. The core innovation of our system lies in the unique training methodology employed for the large language model to generate road networks as its output. This approach draws inspiration from the BLIP-2 architecture arXiv:2301.12597, leveraging pre-trained frozen image encoders and large language models to create a versatile multi-modal LLM.   Our work also offers an alternative to the reasoning segmentation method proposed in the LISA paper arXiv:2308.00692. By training the large language model with our approach, the necessity for generating binary segmentation masks, as suggested in the LISA paper arXiv:2308.00692, is effectively eliminated. Experimental results underscore the efficacy of our multi-modal LLM in providing precise and valuable navigational guidance. This research represents a significant stride in bolstering autonomous navigation systems, especially in road network scenarios, where accurate guidance is of paramount importance.

**ABSTRACT**  
Unsupervised depth completion methods are trained by minimizing sparse depth and image reconstruction error. Block artifacts from resampling, intensity saturation, and occlusions are amongst the many undesirable by-products of common data augmentation schemes that affect image reconstruction quality, and thus the training signal. Hence, typical augmentations on images that are viewed as essential to training pipelines in other vision tasks have seen limited use beyond small image intensity changes and flipping. The sparse depth modality have seen even less as intensity transformations alter the scale of the 3D scene, and geometric transformations may decimate the sparse points during resampling. We propose a method that unlocks a wide range of previously-infeasible geometric augmentations for unsupervised depth completion. This is achieved by reversing, or "undo"-ing, geometric transformations to the coordinates of the output depth, warping the depth map back to the original reference frame. This enables computing the reconstruction losses using the original images and sparse depth maps, eliminating the pitfalls of naive loss computation on the augmented inputs. This simple yet effective strategy allows us to scale up augmentations to boost performance. We demonstrate our method on indoor (VOID) and outdoor (KITTI) datasets where we improve upon three existing methods by an average of 10.4\% across both datasets.

**ABSTRACT**  
We introduce AMAGO, an in-context Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent that uses sequence models to tackle the challenges of generalization, long-term memory, and meta-learning. Recent works have shown that off-policy learning can make in-context RL with recurrent policies viable. Nonetheless, these approaches require extensive tuning and limit scalability by creating key bottlenecks in agents' memory capacity, planning horizon, and model size. AMAGO revisits and redesigns the off-policy in-context approach to successfully train long-sequence Transformers over entire rollouts in parallel with end-to-end RL. Our agent is uniquely scalable and applicable to a wide range of problems. We demonstrate its strong performance empirically in meta-RL and long-term memory domains. AMAGO's focus on sparse rewards and off-policy data also allows in-context learning to extend to goal-conditioned problems with challenging exploration. When combined with a novel hindsight relabeling scheme, AMAGO can solve a previously difficult category of open-world domains, where agents complete many possible instructions in procedurally generated environments. We evaluate our agent on three goal-conditioned domains and study how its individual improvements connect to create a generalist policy.

**ABSTRACT**  
A Retrieval-Augmented Language Model (RALM) augments a generative language model by retrieving context-specific knowledge from an external database. This strategy facilitates impressive text generation quality even with smaller models, thus reducing orders of magnitude of computational demands. However, RALMs introduce unique system design challenges due to (a) the diverse workload characteristics between LM inference and retrieval and (b) the various system requirements and bottlenecks for different RALM configurations such as model sizes, database sizes, and retrieval frequencies. We propose Chameleon, a heterogeneous accelerator system that integrates both LM and retrieval accelerators in a disaggregated architecture. The heterogeneity ensures efficient acceleration of both LM inference and retrieval, while the accelerator disaggregation enables the system to independently scale both types of accelerators to fulfill diverse RALM requirements. Our Chameleon prototype implements retrieval accelerators on FPGAs and assigns LM inference to GPUs, with a CPU server orchestrating these accelerators over the network. Compared to CPU-based and CPU-GPU vector search systems, Chameleon achieves up to 23.72x speedup and 26.2x energy efficiency.

**ABSTRACT**  
Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown an outstanding capability for solving complex computational problems. However, most RL algorithms lack an explicit method that would allow learning from contextual information. Humans use context to identify patterns and relations among elements in the environment, along with how to avoid making wrong actions. On the other hand, what may seem like an obviously wrong decision from a human perspective could take hundreds of steps for an RL agent to learn to avoid. This paper proposes a framework for discrete environments called Iota explicit context representation (IECR). The framework involves representing each state using contextual key frames (CKFs), which can then be used to extract a function that represents the affordances of the state; in addition, two loss functions are introduced with respect to the affordances of the state. The novelty of the IECR framework lies in its capacity to extract contextual information from the environment and learn from the CKFs' representation. We validate the framework by developing four new algorithms that learn using context: Iota deep Q-network (IDQN), Iota double deep Q-network (IDDQN), Iota dueling deep Q-network (IDuDQN), and Iota dueling double deep Q-network (IDDDQN). Furthermore, we evaluate the framework and the new algorithms in five discrete environments. We show that all the algorithms, which use contextual information, converge in around 40,000 training steps of the neural networks, significantly outperforming their state-of-the-art equivalents.

**ABSTRACT**  
Text-attributed graphs have recently garnered significant attention due to their wide range of applications in web domains. Existing methodologies employ word embedding models for acquiring text representations as node features, which are subsequently fed into Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for training. Recently, the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has introduced their powerful capabilities in information retrieval and text generation, which can greatly enhance the text attributes of graph data. Furthermore, the acquisition and labeling of extensive datasets are both costly and time-consuming endeavors. Consequently, few-shot learning has emerged as a crucial problem in the context of graph learning tasks. In order to tackle this challenge, we propose a lightweight paradigm called ENG, which adopts a plug-and-play approach to empower text-attributed graphs through node generation using LLMs. Specifically, we utilize LLMs to extract semantic information from the labels and generate samples that belong to these categories as exemplars. Subsequently, we employ an edge predictor to capture the structural information inherent in the raw dataset and integrate the newly generated samples into the original graph. This approach harnesses LLMs for enhancing class-level information and seamlessly introduces labeled nodes and edges without modifying the raw dataset, thereby facilitating the node classification task in few-shot scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate the outstanding performance of our proposed paradigm, particularly in low-shot scenarios. For instance, in the 1-shot setting of the ogbn-arxiv dataset, ENG achieves a 76% improvement over the baseline model.

**ABSTRACT**  
Resource allocation significantly impacts the performance of vehicle-to-everything (V2X) networks. Most existing algorithms for resource allocation are based on optimization or machine learning (e.g., reinforcement learning). In this paper, we explore resource allocation in a V2X network under the framework of federated reinforcement learning (FRL). On one hand, the usage of RL overcomes many challenges from the model-based optimization schemes. On the other hand, federated learning (FL) enables agents to deal with a number of practical issues, such as privacy, communication overhead, and exploration efficiency. The framework of FRL is then implemented by the inexact alternative direction method of multipliers (ADMM), where subproblems are solved approximately using policy gradients and accelerated by an adaptive step size calculated from their second moments. The developed algorithm, PASM, is proven to be convergent under mild conditions and has a nice numerical performance compared with some baseline methods for solving the resource allocation problem in a V2X network.

**ABSTRACT**  
A large number of computational and scientific methods commonly require decomposing a sparse matrix into triangular factors as LU decomposition. A common problem faced during this decomposition is that even though the given matrix may be very sparse, the decomposition may lead to a denser triangular factors due to fill-in. A significant fill-in may lead to prohibitively larger computational costs and memory requirement during decomposition as well as during the solve phase. To this end, several heuristic sparse matrix reordering methods have been proposed to reduce fill-in before the decomposition. However, finding an optimal reordering algorithm that leads to minimal fill-in during such decomposition is known to be a NP-hard problem. A reinforcement learning based approach is proposed for this problem. The sparse matrix reordering problem is formulated as a single player game. More specifically, Monte-Carlo tree search in combination with neural network is used as a decision making algorithm to search for the best move in our game. The proposed method, alphaElimination is found to produce significantly lesser non-zeros in the LU decomposition as compared to existing state-of-the-art heuristic algorithms with little to no increase in overall running time of the algorithm. The code for the project will be publicly available here\footnote{\url{https://github.com/misterpawan/alphaEliminationPaper}}.

**ABSTRACT**  
Generative AI has seen remarkable growth over the past few years, with diffusion models being state-of-the-art for image generation. This study investigates the use of diffusion models in generating artificial data generation for electronic circuits for enhancing the accuracy of subsequent machine learning models in tasks such as performance assessment, design, and testing when training data is usually known to be very limited. We utilize simulations in the HSPICE design environment with 22nm CMOS technology nodes to obtain representative real training data for our proposed diffusion model. Our results demonstrate the close resemblance of synthetic data using diffusion model to real data. We validate the quality of generated data, and demonstrate that data augmentation certainly effective in predictive analysis of VLSI design for digital circuits.

**ABSTRACT**  
Robust multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) necessitates resilience to uncertain or worst-case actions by unknown allies. Existing max-min optimization techniques in robust MARL seek to enhance resilience by training agents against worst-case adversaries, but this becomes intractable as the number of agents grows, leading to exponentially increasing worst-case scenarios. Attempts to simplify this complexity often yield overly pessimistic policies, inadequate robustness across scenarios and high computational demands. Unlike these approaches, humans naturally learn adaptive and resilient behaviors without the necessity of preparing for every conceivable worst-case scenario. Motivated by this, we propose MIR2, which trains policy in routine scenarios and minimize Mutual Information as Robust Regularization. Theoretically, we frame robustness as an inference problem and prove that minimizing mutual information between histories and actions implicitly maximizes a lower bound on robustness under certain assumptions. Further analysis reveals that our proposed approach prevents agents from overreacting to others through an information bottleneck and aligns the policy with a robust action prior. Empirically, our MIR2 displays even greater resilience against worst-case adversaries than max-min optimization in StarCraft II, Multi-agent Mujoco and rendezvous. Our superiority is consistent when deployed in challenging real-world robot swarm control scenario. See code and demo videos in Supplementary Materials.

**ABSTRACT**  
Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) has emerged as a collaborative training paradigm that allows participants with different features of the same group of users to accomplish cooperative training without exposing their raw data or model parameters. VFL has gained significant attention for its research potential and real-world applications in recent years, but still faces substantial challenges, such as in defending various kinds of data inference and backdoor attacks. Moreover, most of existing VFL projects are industry-facing and not easily used for keeping track of the current research progress. To address this need, we present an extensible and lightweight VFL framework VFLAIR (available at https://github.com/FLAIR-THU/VFLAIR), which supports VFL training with a variety of models, datasets and protocols, along with standardized modules for comprehensive evaluations of attacks and defense strategies. We also benchmark 11 attacks and 8 defenses performance under different communication and model partition settings and draw concrete insights and recommendations on the choice of defense strategies for different practical VFL deployment scenario.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), including Homogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HomoGNNs) and Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HeteGNNs), have made remarkable progress in many physical scenarios, especially in communication applications. Despite achieving great success, the privacy issue of such models has also received considerable attention. Previous studies have shown that given a well-fitted target GNN, the attacker can reconstruct the sensitive training graph of this model via model inversion attacks, leading to significant privacy worries for the AI service provider. We advocate that the vulnerability comes from the target GNN itself and the prior knowledge about the shared properties in real-world graphs. Inspired by this, we propose a novel model inversion attack method on HomoGNNs and HeteGNNs, namely HomoGMI and HeteGMI. Specifically, HomoGMI and HeteGMI are gradient-descent-based optimization methods that aim to maximize the cross-entropy loss on the target GNN and the $1^{st}$ and $2^{nd}$-order proximities on the reconstructed graph. Notably, to the best of our knowledge, HeteGMI is the first attempt to perform model inversion attacks on HeteGNNs. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve better performance than the competitors.

**ABSTRACT**  
Data analysis that uses the output of topological data analysis as input for machine learning algorithms has been the subject of extensive research. This approach offers a means of capturing the global structure of data. Persistent homology (PH), a common methodology within the field of TDA, has found wide-ranging applications in machine learning. One of the key reasons for the success of the PH-ML pipeline lies in the deterministic nature of feature extraction conducted through PH. The ability to achieve satisfactory levels of accuracy with relatively simple downstream machine learning models, when processing these extracted features, underlines the pipeline's superior interpretability. However, it must be noted that this interpretation has encountered issues. Specifically, it fails to accurately reflect the feasible parameter region in the data generation process, and the physical or chemical constraints that restrict this process. Against this backdrop, we explore the potential application of explainable AI methodologies to this PH-ML pipeline. We apply this approach to the specific problem of predicting gas adsorption in metal-organic frameworks and demonstrate that it can yield suggestive results. The codes to reproduce our results are available at https://github.com/naofumihama/xai_ph_ml

**ABSTRACT**  
While generating better negative samples for contrastive learning has been widely studied in the areas of CV and NLP, very few work has focused on graph-structured data. Recently, Mixup has been introduced to synthesize hard negative samples in graph contrastive learning (GCL). However, due to the unsupervised learning nature of GCL, without the help of soft labels, directly mixing representations of samples could inadvertently lead to the information loss of the original hard negative and further adversely affect the quality of the newly generated harder negative. To address the problem, in this paper, we propose a novel method DropMix to synthesize harder negative samples, which consists of two main steps. Specifically, we first select some hard negative samples by measuring their hardness from both local and global views in the graph simultaneously. After that, we mix hard negatives only on partial representation dimensions to generate harder ones and decrease the information loss caused by Mixup. We conduct extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of DropMix on six benchmark datasets. Our results show that our method can lead to better GCL performance. Our data and codes are publicly available at https://github.com/Mayueq/DropMix-Code.

**ABSTRACT**  
Multivariate time series forecasting plays a pivotal role in contemporary web technologies. In contrast to conventional methods that involve creating dedicated models for specific time series application domains, this research advocates for a unified model paradigm that transcends domain boundaries. However, learning an effective cross-domain model presents the following challenges. First, various domains exhibit disparities in data characteristics, e.g., the number of variables, posing hurdles for existing models that impose inflexible constraints on these factors. Second, the model may encounter difficulties in distinguishing data from various domains, leading to suboptimal performance in our assessments. Third, the diverse convergence rates of time series domains can also result in compromised empirical performance. To address these issues, we propose UniTime for effective cross-domain time series learning. Concretely, UniTime can flexibly adapt to data with varying characteristics. It also uses domain instructions and a Language-TS Transformer to offer identification information and align two modalities. In addition, UniTime employs masking to alleviate domain convergence speed imbalance issues. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of UniTime in advancing state-of-the-art forecasting performance and zero-shot transferability.

**ABSTRACT**  
Signed Graph Neural Networks (SGNNs) are vital for analyzing complex patterns in real-world signed graphs containing positive and negative links. However, three key challenges hinder current SGNN-based signed graph representation learning: sparsity in signed graphs leaves latent structures undiscovered, unbalanced triangles pose representation difficulties for SGNN models, and real-world signed graph datasets often lack supplementary information like node labels and features. These constraints limit the potential of SGNN-based representation learning. We address these issues with data augmentation techniques. Despite many graph data augmentation methods existing for unsigned graphs, none are tailored for signed graphs. Our paper introduces the novel Signed Graph Augmentation framework (SGA), comprising three main components. First, we employ the SGNN model to encode the signed graph, extracting latent structural information for candidate augmentation structures. Second, we evaluate these candidate samples (edges) and select the most beneficial ones for modifying the original training set. Third, we propose a novel augmentation perspective that assigns varying training difficulty to training samples, enabling the design of a new training strategy. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets (Bitcoin-alpha, Bitcoin-otc, Epinions, Slashdot, Wiki-elec, and Wiki-RfA) demonstrate that SGA significantly improves performance across multiple benchmarks. Our method outperforms baselines by up to 22.2% in AUC for SGCN on Wiki-RfA, 33.3% in F1-binary, 48.8% in F1-micro, and 36.3% in F1-macro for GAT on Bitcoin-alpha in link sign prediction.

**ABSTRACT**  
Column generation (CG) is a vital method to solve large-scale problems by dynamically generating variables. It has extensive applications in common combinatorial optimization, such as vehicle routing and scheduling problems, where each iteration step requires solving an NP-hard constrained shortest path problem. Although some heuristic methods for acceleration already exist, they are not versatile enough to solve different problems. In this work, we propose a reinforcement learning-based hyper-heuristic framework, dubbed RLHH, to enhance the performance of CG. RLHH is a selection module embedded in CG to accelerate convergence and get better integer solutions. In each CG iteration, the RL agent selects a low-level heuristic to construct a reduced network only containing the edges with a greater chance of being part of the optimal solution. In addition, we specify RLHH to solve two typical combinatorial optimization problems: Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW) and Bus Driver Scheduling Problem (BDSP). The total cost can be reduced by up to 27.9\% in VRPTW and 15.4\% in BDSP compared to the best lower-level heuristic in our tested scenarios, within equivalent or even less computational time. The proposed RLHH is the first RL-based CG method that outperforms traditional approaches in terms of solution quality, which can promote the application of CG in combinatorial optimization.

**ABSTRACT**  
Despite considerable theoretical progress in the training of neural networks viewed as a multi-agent system of neurons, particularly concerning biological plausibility and decentralized training, their applicability to real-world problems remains limited due to scalability issues. In contrast, error-backpropagation has demonstrated its effectiveness for training deep networks in practice. In this study, we propose a local objective for neurons that, when pursued by neurons individually, align them to exhibit similarities to error-backpropagation in terms of efficiency and scalability during training. For this purpose, we examine a neural network comprising decentralized, self-interested neurons seeking to maximize their local objective -- attention from subsequent layer neurons -- and identify the optimal strategy for neurons. We also analyze the relationship between this strategy and backpropagation, establishing conditions under which the derived strategy is equivalent to error-backpropagation. Lastly, we demonstrate the learning capacity of these multi-agent neural networks through experiments on three datasets and showcase their superior performance relative to error-backpropagation in a catastrophic forgetting benchmark.

**ABSTRACT**  
Neuromorphic Computing promises orders of magnitude improvement in energy efficiency compared to traditional von Neumann computing paradigm. The goal is to develop an adaptive, fault-tolerant, low-footprint, fast, low-energy intelligent system by learning and emulating brain functionality which can be realized through innovation in different abstraction layers including material, device, circuit, architecture and algorithm. As the energy consumption in complex vision tasks keep increasing exponentially due to larger data set and resource-constrained edge devices become increasingly ubiquitous, spike-based neuromorphic computing approaches can be viable alternative to deep convolutional neural network that is dominating the vision field today. In this book chapter, we introduce neuromorphic computing, outline a few representative examples from different layers of the design stack (devices, circuits and algorithms) and conclude with a few exciting applications and future research directions that seem promising for computer vision in the near future.

**ABSTRACT**  
Language models have become the backbone of today's AI systems. However, their predominant left-to-right generation limits the use of bidirectional context, which is essential for tasks that involve filling text in the middle. We propose the Fill-in Language Model (FiLM), a new language modeling approach that allows for flexible generation at any position without adhering to a specific generation order. Its training extends the masked language modeling objective by adopting varying mask probabilities sampled from the Beta distribution to enhance the generative capabilities of FiLM. During inference, FiLM can seamlessly insert missing phrases, sentences, or paragraphs, ensuring that the outputs are fluent and are coherent with the surrounding context. In both automatic and human evaluations, FiLM outperforms existing infilling methods that rely on left-to-right language models trained on rearranged text segments. FiLM is easy to implement and can be either trained from scratch or fine-tuned from a left-to-right language model. Notably, as the model size grows, FiLM's perplexity approaches that of strong left-to-right language models of similar sizes, indicating FiLM's scalability and potential as a large language model.

**ABSTRACT**  
Transformers have become a key architecture in speech processing, but our understanding of how they build up representations of acoustic and linguistic structure is limited. In this study, we address this gap by investigating how measures of 'context-mixing' developed for text models can be adapted and applied to models of spoken language. We identify a linguistic phenomenon that is ideal for such a case study: homophony in French (e.g. livre vs livres), where a speech recognition model has to attend to syntactic cues such as determiners and pronouns in order to disambiguate spoken words with identical pronunciations and transcribe them while respecting grammatical agreement. We perform a series of controlled experiments and probing analyses on Transformer-based speech models. Our findings reveal that representations in encoder-only models effectively incorporate these cues to identify the correct transcription, whereas encoders in encoder-decoder models mainly relegate the task of capturing contextual dependencies to decoder modules.

**ABSTRACT**  
Zero-shot cross-lingual generation assumes finetuning the multilingual pretrained language model (mPLM) on a generation task in one language and then using it to make predictions for this task in other languages. Previous works notice a frequent problem of generation in a wrong language and propose approaches to address it, usually using mT5 as a backbone model. In this work, we test alternative mPLMs, such as mBART and NLLB, considering full finetuning and parameter-efficient finetuning with adapters. We find that mBART with adapters performs similarly to mT5 of the same size, and NLLB can be competitive in some cases. We also underline the importance of tuning learning rate used for finetuning, which helps to alleviate the problem of generation in the wrong language.

**ABSTRACT**  
Dementia is associated with language disorders which impede communication. Here, we automatically learn linguistic disorder patterns by making use of a moderately-sized pre-trained language model and forcing it to focus on reformulated natural language processing (NLP) tasks and associated linguistic patterns. Our experiments show that NLP tasks that encapsulate contextual information and enhance the gradient signal with linguistic patterns benefit performance. We then use the probability estimates from the best model to construct digital linguistic markers measuring the overall quality in communication and the intensity of a variety of language disorders. We investigate how the digital markers characterize dementia speech from a longitudinal perspective. We find that our proposed communication marker is able to robustly and reliably characterize the language of people with dementia, outperforming existing linguistic approaches; and shows external validity via significant correlation with clinical markers of behaviour. Finally, our proposed linguistic disorder markers provide useful insights into gradual language impairment associated with disease progression.

**ABSTRACT**  
Scaling the size of language models usually leads to remarkable advancements in NLP tasks. But it often comes with a price of growing computational cost. Although a sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) can reduce the cost by activating a small subset of parameters (e.g., one expert) for each input, its computation escalates significantly if increasing the number of activated experts, limiting its practical utility. Can we retain the advantages of adding more experts without substantially increasing the computational costs? In this paper, we first demonstrate the superiority of selecting multiple experts and then propose a computation-efficient approach called \textbf{\texttt{Merging Experts into One}} (MEO), which reduces the computation cost to that of a single expert. Extensive experiments show that MEO significantly improves computational efficiency, e.g., FLOPS drops from 72.0G of vanilla MoE to 28.6G (MEO). Moreover, we propose a token-level attention block that further enhances the efficiency and performance of token-level MEO, e.g., 83.3\% (MEO) vs. 82.6\% (vanilla MoE) average score on the GLUE benchmark. Our code will be released upon acceptance. Code will be released at: \url{https://github.com/Shwai-He/MEO}.

**ABSTRACT**  
Student modeling is central to many educational technologies as it enables the prediction of future learning outcomes and targeted instructional strategies. However, open-ended learning environments pose challenges for accurately modeling students due to the diverse behaviors exhibited by students and the absence of a well-defined set of learning skills. To approach these challenges, we explore the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) for in-context student modeling in open-ended learning environments. We introduce a novel framework, LLM-SS, that leverages LLMs for synthesizing student's behavior. More concretely, given a particular student's solving attempt on a reference task as observation, the goal is to synthesize the student's attempt on a target task. Our framework can be combined with different LLMs; moreover, we fine-tune LLMs using domain-specific expertise to boost their understanding of domain background and student behaviors. We evaluate several concrete methods based on LLM-SS using the StudentSyn benchmark, an existing student's attempt synthesis benchmark in visual programming. Experimental results show a significant improvement compared to baseline methods included in the StudentSyn benchmark. Furthermore, our method using the fine-tuned Llama2-70B model improves noticeably compared to using the base model and becomes on par with using the state-of-the-art GPT-4 model.

**ABSTRACT**  
Large language models (LLMs) have been treated as knowledge bases due to their strong performance in knowledge probing tasks. LLMs are typically evaluated using accuracy, yet this metric does not capture the vulnerability of LLMs to hallucination-inducing factors like prompt and context variability. How do we evaluate the capabilities of LLMs to consistently produce factually correct answers? In this paper, we propose MOdel kNowledge relIabiliTy scORe (MONITOR), a novel metric designed to directly measure LLMs' factual reliability. MONITOR computes the distance between the probability distributions of a valid output and its counterparts produced by the same LLM probing the same fact using different styles of prompts and contexts.Experiments on a comprehensive range of 12 LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of MONITOR in evaluating the factual reliability of LLMs while maintaining a low computational overhead. In addition, we release the FKTC (Factual Knowledge Test Corpus) test set, containing 210,158 prompts in total to foster research along this line (https://github.com/Vicky-Wil/MONITOR).

**ABSTRACT**  
The dialogue systems in customer services have been developed with neural models to provide users with precise answers and round-the-clock support in task-oriented conversations by detecting customer intents based on their utterances. Existing intent detection approaches have highly relied on adaptively pre-training language models with large-scale datasets, yet the predominant cost of data collection may hinder their superiority. In addition, they neglect the information within the conversational responses of the agents, which have a lower collection cost, but are significant to customer intent as agents must tailor their replies based on the customers' intent. In this paper, we propose RSVP, a self-supervised framework dedicated to task-oriented dialogues, which utilizes agent responses for pre-training in a two-stage manner. Specifically, we introduce two pre-training tasks to incorporate the relations of utterance-response pairs: 1) Response Retrieval by selecting a correct response from a batch of candidates, and 2) Response Generation by mimicking agents to generate the response to a given utterance. Our benchmark results for two real-world customer service datasets show that RSVP significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines by 4.95% for accuracy, 3.4% for MRR@3, and 2.75% for MRR@5 on average. Extensive case studies are investigated to show the validity of incorporating agent responses into the pre-training stage.

**ABSTRACT**  
In the field of natural language understanding, the intersection of neural models and graph meaning representations (GMRs) remains a compelling area of research. Despite the growing interest, a critical gap persists in understanding the exact influence of GMRs, particularly concerning relation extraction tasks. Addressing this, we introduce DAGNN-plus, a simple and parameter-efficient neural architecture designed to decouple contextual representation learning from structural information propagation. Coupled with various sequence encoders and GMRs, this architecture provides a foundation for systematic experimentation on two English and two Chinese datasets. Our empirical analysis utilizes four different graph formalisms and nine parsers. The results yield a nuanced understanding of GMRs, showing improvements in three out of the four datasets, particularly favoring English over Chinese due to highly accurate parsers. Interestingly, GMRs appear less effective in literary-domain datasets compared to general-domain datasets. These findings lay the groundwork for better-informed design of GMRs and parsers to improve relation classification, which is expected to tangibly impact the future trajectory of natural language understanding research.

**ABSTRACT**  
Multimodal language generation, which leverages the synergy of language and vision, is a rapidly expanding field. However, existing vision-language models face challenges in tasks that require complex linguistic understanding. To address this issue, we introduce Visual-Language models as Importance Sampling weights (VLIS), a novel framework that combines the visual conditioning capability of vision-language models with the language understanding of unimodal text-only language models without further training. It extracts pointwise mutual information of each image and text from a visual-language model and uses the value as an importance sampling weight to adjust the token likelihood from a text-only model. VLIS improves vision-language models on diverse tasks, including commonsense understanding (WHOOPS, OK-VQA, and ScienceQA) and complex text generation (Concadia, Image Paragraph Captioning, and ROCStories). Our results suggest that VLIS represents a promising new direction for multimodal language generation.

**ABSTRACT**  
Most legal text in the Indian judiciary is written in complex English due to historical reasons. However, only about 10% of the Indian population is comfortable in reading English. Hence legal text needs to be made available in various Indian languages, possibly by translating the available legal text from English. Though there has been a lot of research on translation to and between Indian languages, to our knowledge, there has not been much prior work on such translation in the legal domain. In this work, we construct the first high-quality legal parallel corpus containing aligned text units in English and nine Indian languages, that includes several low-resource languages. We also benchmark the performance of a wide variety of Machine Translation (MT) systems over this corpus, including commercial MT systems, open-source MT systems and Large Language Models. Through a comprehensive survey by Law practitioners, we check how satisfied they are with the translations by some of these MT systems, and how well automatic MT evaluation metrics agree with the opinions of Law practitioners.

**ABSTRACT**  
The Mixture of Experts (MoE) has emerged as a highly successful technique in deep learning, based on the principle of divide-and-conquer to maximize model capacity without significant additional computational cost. Even in the era of large-scale language models (LLMs), MoE continues to play a crucial role, as some researchers have indicated that GPT-4 adopts the MoE structure to ensure diverse inference results. However, MoE is susceptible to performance degeneracy, particularly evident in the issues of imbalance and homogeneous representation among experts. While previous studies have extensively addressed the problem of imbalance, the challenge of homogeneous representation remains unresolved. In this study, we shed light on the homogeneous representation problem, wherein experts in the MoE fail to specialize and lack diversity, leading to frustratingly high similarities in their representations (up to 99% in a well-performed MoE model). This problem restricts the expressive power of the MoE and, we argue, contradicts its original intention. To tackle this issue, we propose a straightforward yet highly effective solution: OMoE, an orthogonal expert optimizer. Additionally, we introduce an alternating training strategy that encourages each expert to update in a direction orthogonal to the subspace spanned by other experts. Our algorithm facilitates MoE training in two key ways: firstly, it explicitly enhances representation diversity, and secondly, it implicitly fosters interaction between experts during orthogonal weights computation. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed optimization algorithm significantly improves the performance of fine-tuning the MoE model on the GLUE benchmark, SuperGLUE benchmark, question-answering task, and name entity recognition tasks.

In this paper, we construct an Indonesian self-supervised financial corpus, Indonesian financial sentiment analysis dataset, Indonesian financial topic classification dataset, and release a family of BERT models for financial NLP. We also evaluate the effectiveness of domain-specific post-training on sentiment analysis and topic classification tasks. Our findings indicate that the post-training increases the effectiveness of a language model when it is fine-tuned to domain-specific downstream tasks.

**ABSTRACT**  
Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable performance on knowledge-intensive tasks, suggesting that real-world knowledge is encoded in their model parameters. However, besides explorations on a few probing tasks in limited knowledge domains, it is not well understood how to evaluate LLMs' knowledge systematically and how well their knowledge abilities generalize, across a spectrum of knowledge domains and progressively complex task formats. To this end, we propose KGQuiz, a knowledge-intensive benchmark to comprehensively investigate the knowledge generalization abilities of LLMs. KGQuiz is a scalable framework constructed from triplet-based knowledge, which covers three knowledge domains and consists of five tasks with increasing complexity: true-or-false, multiple-choice QA, blank filling, factual editing, and open-ended knowledge generation. To gain a better understanding of LLMs' knowledge abilities and their generalization, we evaluate 10 open-source and black-box LLMs on the KGQuiz benchmark across the five knowledge-intensive tasks and knowledge domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLMs achieve impressive performance in straightforward knowledge QA tasks, while settings and contexts requiring more complex reasoning or employing domain-specific facts still present significant challenges. We envision KGQuiz as a testbed to analyze such nuanced variations in performance across domains and task formats, and ultimately to understand, evaluate, and improve LLMs' knowledge abilities across a wide spectrum of knowledge domains and tasks.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this paper, we propose a hierarchical contrastive learning framework, HiCL, which considers local segment-level and global sequence-level relationships to improve training efficiency and effectiveness. Traditional methods typically encode a sequence in its entirety for contrast with others, often neglecting local representation learning, leading to challenges in generalizing to shorter texts. Conversely, HiCL improves its effectiveness by dividing the sequence into several segments and employing both local and global contrastive learning to model segment-level and sequence-level relationships. Further, considering the quadratic time complexity of transformers over input tokens, HiCL boosts training efficiency by first encoding short segments and then aggregating them to obtain the sequence representation. Extensive experiments show that HiCL enhances the prior top-performing SNCSE model across seven extensively evaluated STS tasks, with an average increase of +0.2% observed on BERT-large and +0.44% on RoBERTa-large.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper primarily focuses on evaluating and benchmarking the robustness of visual representations in the context of object assembly tasks. Specifically, it investigates the alignment and insertion of objects with geometrical extrusions and intrusions, commonly referred to as a peg-in-hole task. The accuracy required to detect and orient the peg and the hole geometry in SE(3) space for successful assembly poses significant challenges. Addressing this, we employ a general framework in visuomotor policy learning that utilizes visual pretraining models as vision encoders. Our study investigates the robustness of this framework when applied to a dual-arm manipulation setup, specifically to the grasp variations. Our quantitative analysis shows that existing pretrained models fail to capture the essential visual features necessary for this task. However, a visual encoder trained from scratch consistently outperforms the frozen pretrained models. Moreover, we discuss rotation representations and associated loss functions that substantially improve policy learning. We present a novel task scenario designed to evaluate the progress in visuomotor policy learning, with a specific focus on improving the robustness of intricate assembly tasks that require both geometrical and spatial reasoning.

**ABSTRACT**  
Model-based approaches for planning and control for bipedal locomotion have a long history of success. It can provide stability and safety guarantees while being effective in accomplishing many locomotion tasks. Model-free reinforcement learning, on the other hand, has gained much popularity in recent years due to computational advancements. It can achieve high performance in specific tasks, but it lacks physical interpretability and flexibility in re-purposing the policy for a different set of tasks. For instance, we can initially train a neural network (NN) policy using velocity commands as inputs. However, to handle new task commands like desired hand or footstep locations at a desired walking velocity, we must retrain a new NN policy. In this work, we attempt to bridge the gap between these two bodies of work on a bipedal platform. We formulate a model-based reinforcement learning problem to learn a reduced-order model (ROM) within a model predictive control (MPC). Results show a 49% improvement in viable task region size and a 21% reduction in motor torque cost. All videos and code are available at https://sites.google.com/view/ymchen/research/rl-for-roms.

**ABSTRACT**  
In contact-rich tasks, the hybrid, multi-modal nature of contact dynamics poses great challenges in model representation, planning, and control. Recent efforts have attempted to address these challenges via data-driven methods, learning dynamical models in combination with model predictive control. Those methods, while effective, rely solely on minimizing forward prediction errors to hope for better task performance with MPC controllers. This weak correlation can result in data inefficiency as well as limitations to overall performance. In response, we propose a novel strategy: using a policy gradient algorithm to find a simplified dynamics model that explicitly maximizes task performance. Specifically, we parameterize the stochastic policy as the perturbed output of the MPC controller, thus, the learned model representation can directly associate with the policy or task performance. We apply the proposed method to contact-rich tasks where a three-fingered robotic hand manipulates previously unknown objects. Our method significantly enhances task success rate by up to 15% in manipulating diverse objects compared to the existing method while sustaining data efficiency. Our method can solve some tasks with success rates of 70% or higher using under 30 minutes of data. All videos and codes are available at https://sites.google.com/view/lcs-rl.

**ABSTRACT**  
Transfer-based adversarial attacks raise a severe threat to real-world deep learning systems since they do not require access to target models. Adversarial training (AT), which is recognized as the strongest defense against white-box attacks, has also guaranteed high robustness to (black-box) transfer-based attacks. However, AT suffers from heavy computational overhead since it optimizes the adversarial examples during the whole training process. In this paper, we demonstrate that such heavy optimization is not necessary for AT against transfer-based attacks. Instead, a one-shot adversarial augmentation prior to training is sufficient, and we name this new defense paradigm Data-centric Robust Learning (DRL). Our experimental results show that DRL outperforms widely-used AT techniques (e.g., PGD-AT, TRADES, EAT, and FAT) in terms of black-box robustness and even surpasses the top-1 defense on RobustBench when combined with diverse data augmentations and loss regularizations. We also identify other benefits of DRL, for instance, the model generalization capability and robust fairness.

**ABSTRACT**  
Advance Persistent Threats (APTs), adopted by most delicate attackers, are becoming increasing common and pose great threat to various enterprises and institutions. Data provenance analysis on provenance graphs has emerged as a common approach in APT detection. However, previous works have exhibited several shortcomings: (1) requiring attack-containing data and a priori knowledge of APTs, (2) failing in extracting the rich contextual information buried within provenance graphs and (3) becoming impracticable due to their prohibitive computation overhead and memory consumption.   In this paper, we introduce MAGIC, a novel and flexible self-supervised APT detection approach capable of performing multi-granularity detection under different level of supervision. MAGIC leverages masked graph representation learning to model benign system entities and behaviors, performing efficient deep feature extraction and structure abstraction on provenance graphs. By ferreting out anomalous system behaviors via outlier detection methods, MAGIC is able to perform both system entity level and batched log level APT detection. MAGIC is specially designed to handle concept drift with a model adaption mechanism and successfully applies to universal conditions and detection scenarios. We evaluate MAGIC on three widely-used datasets, including both real-world and simulated attacks. Evaluation results indicate that MAGIC achieves promising detection results in all scenarios and shows enormous advantage over state-of-the-art APT detection approaches in performance overhead.

**ABSTRACT**  
As the number of parameters in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) scales, the thirst for training data also increases. To save costs, it has become common for users and enterprises to delegate time-consuming data collection to third parties. Unfortunately, recent research has shown that this practice raises the risk of DNNs being exposed to backdoor attacks. Specifically, an attacker can maliciously control the behavior of a trained model by poisoning a small portion of the training data. In this study, we focus on improving the poisoning efficiency of backdoor attacks from the sample selection perspective. The existing attack methods construct such poisoned samples by randomly selecting some clean data from the benign set and then embedding a trigger into them. However, this random selection strategy ignores that each sample may contribute differently to the backdoor injection, thereby reducing the poisoning efficiency. To address the above problem, a new selection strategy named Improved Filtering and Updating Strategy (FUS++) is proposed. Specifically, we adopt the forgetting events of the samples to indicate the contribution of different poisoned samples and use the curvature of the loss surface to analyses the effectiveness of this phenomenon. Accordingly, we combine forgetting events and curvature of different samples to conduct a simple yet efficient sample selection strategy. The experimental results on image classification (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-10), text classification (AG News), audio classification (ESC-50), and age regression (Facial Age) consistently demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy: the attack performance using FUS++ is significantly higher than that using random selection for the same poisoning ratio.

Social media platforms, particularly Twitter, have become pivotal arenas for influence campaigns, often orchestrated by state-sponsored information operations (IOs). This paper delves into the detection of key players driving IOs by employing similarity graphs constructed from behavioral pattern data. We unveil that well-known, yet underutilized network properties can help accurately identify coordinated IO drivers. Drawing from a comprehensive dataset of 49 million tweets from six countries, which includes multiple verified IOs, our study reveals that traditional network filtering techniques do not consistently pinpoint IO drivers across campaigns. We first propose a framework based on node pruning that emerges superior, particularly when combining multiple behavioral indicators across different networks. Then, we introduce a supervised machine learning model that harnesses a vector representation of the fused similarity network. This model, which boasts a precision exceeding 0.95, adeptly classifies IO drivers on a global scale and reliably forecasts their temporal engagements. Our findings are crucial in the fight against deceptive influence campaigns on social media, helping us better understand and detect them.

**ABSTRACT**  
Modern techniques in Content-based Recommendation (CBR) leverage item content information to provide personalized services to users, but suffer from resource-intensive training on large datasets. To address this issue, we explore the dataset condensation for textual CBR in this paper. The goal of dataset condensation is to synthesize a small yet informative dataset, upon which models can achieve performance comparable to those trained on large datasets. While existing condensation approaches are tailored to classification tasks for continuous data like images or embeddings, direct application of them to CBR has limitations. To bridge this gap, we investigate efficient dataset condensation for content-based recommendation. Inspired by the remarkable abilities of large language models (LLMs) in text comprehension and generation, we leverage LLMs to empower the generation of textual content during condensation. To handle the interaction data involving both users and items, we devise a dual-level condensation method: content-level and user-level. At content-level, we utilize LLMs to condense all contents of an item into a new informative title. At user-level, we design a clustering-based synthesis module, where we first utilize LLMs to extract user interests. Then, the user interests and user embeddings are incorporated to condense users and generate interactions for condensed users. Notably, the condensation paradigm of this method is forward and free from iterative optimization on the synthesized dataset. Extensive empirical findings from our study, conducted on three authentic datasets, substantiate the efficacy of the proposed method. Particularly, we are able to approximate up to 97% of the original performance while reducing the dataset size by 95% (i.e., on dataset MIND).

**ABSTRACT**  
Few-shot named entity recognition (NER) has shown remarkable progress in identifying entities in low-resource domains. However, few-shot NER methods still struggle with out-of-domain (OOD) examples due to their reliance on manual labeling for the target domain. To address this limitation, recent studies enable generalization to an unseen target domain with only a few labeled examples using data augmentation techniques. Two important challenges remain: First, augmentation is limited to the training data, resulting in minimal overlap between the generated data and OOD examples. Second, knowledge transfer is implicit and insufficient, severely hindering model generalizability and the integration of knowledge from the source domain. In this paper, we propose a framework, prompt learning with type-related features (PLTR), to address these challenges. To identify useful knowledge in the source domain and enhance knowledge transfer, PLTR automatically extracts entity type-related features (TRFs) based on mutual information criteria. To bridge the gap between training and OOD data, PLTR generates a unique prompt for each unseen example by selecting relevant TRFs. We show that PLTR achieves significant performance improvements on in-domain and cross-domain datasets. The use of PLTR facilitates model adaptation and increases representation similarities between the source and unseen domains.

**ABSTRACT**  
User modeling, which aims to capture users' characteristics or interests, heavily relies on task-specific labeled data and suffers from the data sparsity issue. Several recent studies tackled this problem by pre-training the user model on massive user behavior sequences with a contrastive learning task. Generally, these methods assume different views of the same behavior sequence constructed via data augmentation are semantically consistent, i.e., reflecting similar characteristics or interests of the user, and thus maximizing their agreement in the feature space. However, due to the diverse interests and heavy noise in user behaviors, existing augmentation methods tend to lose certain characteristics of the user or introduce noisy interests. Thus, forcing the user model to directly maximize the similarity between the augmented views may result in a negative transfer. To this end, we propose to replace the contrastive learning task with a new pretext task: Augmentation-Adaptive Self-Supervised Ranking (AdaptSSR), which alleviates the requirement of semantic consistency between the augmented views while pre-training a discriminative user model. Specifically, we adopt a multiple pairwise ranking loss which trains the user model to capture the similarity orders between the implicitly augmented view, the explicitly augmented view, and views from other users. We further employ an in-batch hard negative sampling strategy to facilitate model training. Moreover, considering the distinct impacts of data augmentation on different behavior sequences, we design an augmentation-adaptive fusion mechanism to automatically adjust the similarity order constraint applied to each sample based on the estimated similarity between the augmented views. Extensive experiments on both public and industrial datasets with six downstream tasks verify the effectiveness of AdaptSSR.

**ABSTRACT**  
Instrument playing techniques (IPTs) constitute a pivotal component of musical expression. However, the development of automatic IPT detection methods suffers from limited labeled data and inherent class imbalance issues. In this paper, we propose to apply a self-supervised learning model pre-trained on large-scale unlabeled music data and finetune it on IPT detection tasks. This approach addresses data scarcity and class imbalance challenges. Recognizing the significance of pitch in capturing the nuances of IPTs and the importance of onset in locating IPT events, we investigate multi-task finetuning with pitch and onset detection as auxiliary tasks. Additionally, we apply a post-processing approach for event-level prediction, where an IPT activation initiates an event only if the onset output confirms an onset in that frame. Our method outperforms prior approaches in both frame-level and event-level metrics across multiple IPT benchmark datasets. Further experiments demonstrate the efficacy of multi-task finetuning on each IPT class.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper explores the modeling method of polyphonic music sequence. Due to the great potential of Transformer models in music generation, controllable music generation is receiving more attention. In the task of polyphonic music, current controllable generation research focuses on controlling the generation of chords, but lacks precise adjustment for the controllable generation of choral music textures. This paper proposed Condition Choir Transformer (CoCoFormer) which controls the output of the model by controlling the chord and rhythm inputs at a fine-grained level. In this paper, the self-supervised method improves the loss function and performs joint training through conditional control input and unconditional input training. In order to alleviate the lack of diversity on generated samples caused by the teacher forcing training, this paper added an adversarial training method. CoCoFormer enhances model performance with explicit and implicit inputs to chords and rhythms. In this paper, the experiments proves that CoCoFormer has reached the current better level than current models. On the premise of specifying the polyphonic music texture, the same melody can also be generated in a variety of ways.

**ABSTRACT**  
The AI model has surpassed human players in the game of Go, and it is widely believed that the AI model has encoded new knowledge about the Go game beyond human players. In this way, explaining the knowledge encoded by the AI model and using it to teach human players represent a promising-yet-challenging issue in explainable AI. To this end, mathematical supports are required to ensure that human players can learn accurate and verifiable knowledge, rather than specious intuitive analysis. Thus, in this paper, we extract interaction primitives between stones encoded by the value network for the Go game, so as to enable people to learn from the value network. Experiments show the effectiveness of our method.

**ABSTRACT**  
Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) aims to map entities and relations of a knowledge graph (KG) into a low-dimensional and dense vector space via contrasting the positive and negative triples. In the training process of KGEs, negative sampling is essential to find high-quality negative triples since KGs only contain positive triples. Most existing negative sampling methods assume that non-existent triples with high scores are high-quality negative triples. However, negative triples sampled by these methods are likely to contain noise. Specifically, they ignore that non-existent triples with high scores might also be true facts due to the incompleteness of KGs, which are usually called false negative triples. To alleviate the above issue, we propose an easily pluggable denoising mixup method called DeMix, which generates high-quality triples by refining sampled negative triples in a self-supervised manner. Given a sampled unlabeled triple, DeMix firstly classifies it into a marginal pseudo-negative triple or a negative triple based on the judgment of the KGE model itself. Secondly, it selects an appropriate mixup partner for the current triple to synthesize a partially positive or a harder negative triple. Experimental results on the knowledge graph completion task show that the proposed DeMix is superior to other negative sampling techniques, ensuring corresponding KGEs a faster convergence and better link prediction results.

**ABSTRACT**  
Fact verification aims to automatically probe the veracity of a claim based on several pieces of evidence. Existing works are always engaging in the accuracy improvement, let alone the explainability, a critical capability of fact verification system. Constructing an explainable fact verification system in a complex multi-hop scenario is consistently impeded by the absence of a relevant high-quality dataset. Previous dataset either suffer from excessive simplification or fail to incorporate essential considerations for explainability. To address this, we present EX-FEVER, a pioneering dataset for multi-hop explainable fact verification. With over 60,000 claims involving 2-hop and 3-hop reasoning, each is created by summarizing and modifying information from hyperlinked Wikipedia documents. Each instance is accompanied by a veracity label and an explanation that outlines the reasoning path supporting the veracity classification. Additionally, we demonstrate a novel baseline system on our EX-FEVER dataset, showcasing document retrieval, explanation generation, and claim verification and observe that existing fact verification models trained on previous datasets struggle to perform well on our dataset. Furthermore, we highlight the potential of utilizing Large Language Models in the fact verification task. We hope our dataset could make a significant contribution by providing ample opportunities to explore the integration of natural language explanations in the domain of fact verification.

**ABSTRACT**  
Pre-trained multimodal models have achieved significant success in retrieval-based question answering. However, current multimodal retrieval question-answering models face two main challenges. Firstly, utilizing compressed evidence features as input to the model results in the loss of fine-grained information within the evidence. Secondly, a gap exists between the feature extraction of evidence and the question, which hinders the model from effectively extracting critical features from the evidence based on the given question. We propose a two-stage framework for evidence retrieval and question-answering to alleviate these issues. First and foremost, we propose a progressive evidence refinement strategy for selecting crucial evidence. This strategy employs an iterative evidence retrieval approach to uncover the logical sequence among the evidence pieces. It incorporates two rounds of filtering to optimize the solution space, thus further ensuring temporal efficiency. Subsequently, we introduce a semi-supervised contrastive learning training strategy based on negative samples to expand the scope of the question domain, allowing for a more thorough exploration of latent knowledge within known samples. Finally, in order to mitigate the loss of fine-grained information, we devise a multi-turn retrieval and question-answering strategy to handle multimodal inputs. This strategy involves incorporating multimodal evidence directly into the model as part of the historical dialogue and question. Meanwhile, we leverage a cross-modal attention mechanism to capture the underlying connections between the evidence and the question, and the answer is generated through a decoding generation approach. We validate the model's effectiveness through extensive experiments, achieving outstanding performance on WebQA and MultimodelQA benchmark tests.

**ABSTRACT**  
Visual active search (VAS) has been proposed as a modeling framework in which visual cues are used to guide exploration, with the goal of identifying regions of interest in a large geospatial area. Its potential applications include identifying hot spots of rare wildlife poaching activity, search-and-rescue scenarios, identifying illegal trafficking of weapons, drugs, or people, and many others. State of the art approaches to VAS include applications of deep reinforcement learning (DRL), which yield end-to-end search policies, and traditional active search, which combines predictions with custom algorithmic approaches. While the DRL framework has been shown to greatly outperform traditional active search in such domains, its end-to-end nature does not make full use of supervised information attained either during training, or during actual search, a significant limitation if search tasks differ significantly from those in the training distribution. We propose an approach that combines the strength of both DRL and conventional active search by decomposing the search policy into a prediction module, which produces a geospatial distribution of regions of interest based on task embedding and search history, and a search module, which takes the predictions and search history as input and outputs the search distribution. We develop a novel meta-learning approach for jointly learning the resulting combined policy that can make effective use of supervised information obtained both at training and decision time. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed representation and meta-learning frameworks significantly outperform state of the art in visual active search on several problem domains.

**ABSTRACT**  
Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT (i.e., gpt-3.5-turbo and gpt-4) exhibited remarkable advancement in a range of software engineering tasks associated with source code such as code review and code generation. In this paper, we undertake a comprehensive study by instructing ChatGPT for four prevalent vulnerability tasks: function and line-level vulnerability prediction, vulnerability classification, severity estimation, and vulnerability repair. We compare ChatGPT with state-of-the-art language models designed for software vulnerability purposes. Through an empirical assessment employing extensive real-world datasets featuring over 190,000 C/C++ functions, we found that ChatGPT achieves limited performance, trailing behind other language models in vulnerability contexts by a significant margin. The experimental outcomes highlight the challenging nature of vulnerability prediction tasks, requiring domain-specific expertise. Despite ChatGPT's substantial model scale, exceeding that of source code-pre-trained language models (e.g., CodeBERT) by a factor of 14,000, the process of fine-tuning remains imperative for ChatGPT to generalize for vulnerability prediction tasks. We publish the studied dataset, experimental prompts for ChatGPT, and experimental results at https://github.com/awsm-research/ChatGPT4Vul.

**ABSTRACT**  
Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive in-context learning (ICL) ability in code generation. LLMs take a prompt consisting of requirement-code examples and a new requirement as input, and output new programs. Existing studies have found that ICL is highly dominated by the examples and thus arises research on example selection. However, existing approaches randomly select examples or only consider the textual similarity of requirements to retrieve, leading to sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose a novel learning-based selection approach named LAIL (LLM-Aware In-context Learning) for code generation. Given a candidate example, we exploit LLMs themselves to estimate it by considering the generation probabilities of ground-truth programs given a requirement and the example. We then label candidate examples as positive or negative through the probability feedback. Based on the labeled data, we import a contrastive learning objective to train an effective retriever that acquires the preference of LLMs in code generation. We apply LAIL to three LLMs and evaluate it on three representative datasets (e.g., MBJP, MBPP, and MBCPP). LATA outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines by 11.58%, 6.89%, and 5.07% on CodeGen, and 4.38%, 2.85%, and 2.74% on GPT-3.5 in terms of Pass@1, respectively.

**ABSTRACT**  
Misconfigurations are the major causes of software failures. Existing configuration validation techniques rely on manually written rules or test cases, which are expensive to implement and maintain, and are hard to be comprehensive. Leveraging machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) for configuration validation is considered a promising direction, but has been facing challenges such as the need of not only large-scale configuration data, but also system-specific features and models which are hard to generalize. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) show the promises to address some of the long-lasting limitations of ML/NLP-based configuration validation techniques. In this paper, we present an exploratory analysis on the feasibility and effectiveness of using LLMs like GPT and Codex for configuration validation. Specifically, we take a first step to empirically evaluate LLMs as configuration validators without additional fine-tuning or code generation. We develop a generic LLM-based validation framework, named Ciri, which integrates different LLMs. Ciri devises effective prompt engineering with few-shot learning based on both valid configuration and misconfiguration data. Ciri also validates and aggregates the outputs of LLMs to generate validation results, coping with known hallucination and nondeterminism of LLMs. We evaluate the validation effectiveness of Ciri on five popular LLMs using configuration data of six mature, widely deployed open-source systems. Our analysis (1) confirms the potential of using LLMs for configuration validation, (2) understands the design space of LLMbased validators like Ciri, especially in terms of prompt engineering with few-shot learning, and (3) reveals open challenges such as ineffectiveness in detecting certain types of misconfigurations and biases to popular configuration parameters.

**ABSTRACT**  
The introduction of posit reopened the debate about the utility of IEEE754 in specific domains. In this context, we propose a high-level language (Scala) library that aims to reduce the effort of designing and testing new number representation systems (NRSs). The library's efficiency is tested with three new NRSs derived from Morris Tapered Floating-Point by adding a hidden exponent bit. We call these NRSs MorrisHEB, MorrisBiasHEB, and MorrisUnaryHEB, respectively. We show that they offer a better dynamic range, better decimal accuracy for unary operations, more exact results for addition (37.61% in the case of MorrisUnaryHEB), and better average decimal accuracy for inexact results on binary operations than posit and IEEE754. Going through existing benchmarks in the literature, and favorable/unfavorable examples for IEEE754/posit, we show that these new NRSs produce similar (less than one decimal accuracy difference) or even better results than IEEE754 and posit. Given the entire spectrum of results, there are arguments for MorrisBiasHEB to be used as a replacement for IEEE754 in general computations. MorrisUnaryHEB has a more populated ``golden zone'' (+13.6%) and a better dynamic range (149X) than posit, making it a candidate for machine learning computations.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recently DRAM-based PIMs (processing-in-memories) with unmodified cell arrays have demonstrated impressive performance for accelerating AI applications. However, due to the very restrictive hardware constraints, PIM remains an accelerator for simple functions only. In this paper we propose NTT-PIM, which is based on the same principles such as no modification of cell arrays and very restrictive area budget, but shows state-of-the-art performance for a very complex application such as NTT, thanks to features optimized for the application's characteristics, such as in-place update and pipelining via multiple buffers. Our experimental results demonstrate that our NTT-PIM can outperform previous best PIM-based NTT accelerators in terms of runtime by 1.7 ~ 17 times while having negligible area and power overhead.

**ABSTRACT**  
We consider the max-min fair resource allocation problem. The best-known solutions use either a sequence of optimizations or waterfilling, which only applies to a narrow set of cases. These solutions have become a practical bottleneck in WAN traffic engineering and cluster scheduling, especially at larger problem sizes. We improve both approaches: (1) we show how to convert the optimization sequence into a single fast optimization, and (2) we generalize waterfilling to the multi-path case. We empirically show our new algorithms Pareto-dominate prior techniques: they produce faster, fairer, and more efficient allocations. Some of our allocators also have theoretical guarantees: they trade off a bounded amount of unfairness for faster allocation. We have deployed our allocators in Azure's WAN traffic engineering pipeline, where we preserve solution quality and achieve a roughly $3\times$ speedup.
