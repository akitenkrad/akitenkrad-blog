**ABSTRACT**  
Expanding the scientific tools available to protect computer networks can be aided by a deeper understanding of the underlying statistical distributions of network traffic and their potential geometric interpretations. Analyses of large scale network observations provide a unique window into studying those underlying statistics. Newly developed GraphBLAS hypersparse matrices and D4M associative array technologies enable the efficient anonymized analysis of network traffic on the scale of trillions of events. This work analyzes over 100,000,000,000 anonymized packets from the largest Internet telescope (CAIDA) and over 10,000,000 anonymized sources from the largest commercial honeyfarm (GreyNoise). Neither CAIDA nor GreyNoise actively emit Internet traffic and provide distinct observations of unsolicited Internet traffic (primarily botnets and scanners). Analysis of these observations confirms the previously observed Cauchy-like distributions describing temporal correlations between Internet sources. The Gull lighthouse problem is a well-known geometric characterization of the standard Cauchy distribution and motivates a potential geometric interpretation for Internet observations. This work generalizes the Gull lighthouse problem to accommodate larger classes of coastlines, deriving a closed-form solution for the resulting probability distributions, stating and examining the inverse problem of identifying an appropriate coastline given a continuous probability distribution, identifying a geometric heuristic for solving this problem computationally, and applying that heuristic to examine the temporal geometry of different subsets of network observations. Application of this method to the CAIDA and GreyNoise data reveals a several orders of magnitude difference between known benign and other traffic which can lead to potentially novel ways to protect networks.

**ABSTRACT**  
Explainable AI (XAI) methods aim to describe the decision process of deep neural networks. Early XAI methods produced visual explanations, whereas more recent techniques generate multimodal explanations that include textual information and visual representations. Visual XAI methods have been shown to be vulnerable to white-box and gray-box adversarial attacks, with an attacker having full or partial knowledge of and access to the target system. As the vulnerabilities of multimodal XAI models have not been examined, in this paper we assess for the first time the robustness to black-box attacks of the natural language explanations generated by a self-rationalizing image-based activity recognition model. We generate unrestricted, spatially variant perturbations that disrupt the association between the predictions and the corresponding explanations to mislead the model into generating unfaithful explanations. We show that we can create adversarial images that manipulate the explanations of an activity recognition model by having access only to its final output.

**ABSTRACT**  
We present Self-Context Adaptation (SeCAt), a self-supervised approach that unlocks open-ended few-shot abilities of small visual language models. Our proposed adaptation algorithm explicitly learns from symbolic, yet self-supervised training tasks. Specifically, our approach imitates image captions in a self-supervised way based on clustering a large pool of images followed by assigning semantically-unrelated names to clusters. By doing so, we construct the `self-context', a training signal consisting of interleaved sequences of image and pseudo-caption pairs and a query image for which the model is trained to produce the right pseudo-caption. We demonstrate the performance and flexibility of SeCAt on several multimodal few-shot datasets, spanning various granularities. By using models with approximately 1B parameters we outperform the few-shot abilities of much larger models, such as Frozen and FROMAGe. SeCAt opens new possibilities for research in open-ended few-shot learning that otherwise requires access to large or proprietary models.

**ABSTRACT**  
Echocardiography has become an indispensable clinical imaging modality for general heart health assessment. From calculating biomarkers such as ejection fraction to the probability of a patient's heart failure, accurate segmentation of the heart and its structures allows doctors to plan and execute treatments with greater precision and accuracy. However, achieving accurate and robust left ventricle segmentation is time-consuming and challenging due to different reasons. This work introduces a novel approach for consistent left ventricular (LV) segmentation from sparsely annotated echocardiogram videos. We achieve this through (1) self-supervised learning (SSL) using temporal masking followed by (2) weakly supervised training. We investigate two different segmentation approaches: 3D segmentation and a novel 2D superimage (SI). We demonstrate how our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions by achieving a 93.32% (95%CI 93.21-93.43%) dice score on a large-scale dataset (EchoNet-Dynamic) while being more efficient. To show the effectiveness of our approach, we provide extensive ablation studies, including pre-training settings and various deep learning backbones. Additionally, we discuss how our proposed methodology achieves high data utility by incorporating unlabeled frames in the training process. To help support the AI in medicine community, the complete solution with the source code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this report, we describe the technical details of our submission to the 2023 ABO Fine-grained Semantic Segmentation Competition, by Team "Zeyu\_Dong" (username:ZeyuDong). The task is to predicate the semantic labels for the convex shape of five categories, which consist of high-quality, standardized 3D models of real products available for purchase online. By using DGCNN as the backbone to classify different structures of five classes, We carried out numerous experiments and found learning rate stochastic gradient descent with warm restarts and setting different rate of factors for various categories contribute most to the performance of the model. The appropriate method helps us rank 3rd place in the Dev phase of the 2023 ICCV 3DVeComm Workshop Challenge.

**ABSTRACT**  
The most advanced text-to-image (T2I) models require significant training costs (e.g., millions of GPU hours), seriously hindering the fundamental innovation for the AIGC community while increasing CO2 emissions. This paper introduces PIXART-$\alpha$, a Transformer-based T2I diffusion model whose image generation quality is competitive with state-of-the-art image generators (e.g., Imagen, SDXL, and even Midjourney), reaching near-commercial application standards. Additionally, it supports high-resolution image synthesis up to 1024px resolution with low training cost, as shown in Figure 1 and 2. To achieve this goal, three core designs are proposed: (1) Training strategy decomposition: We devise three distinct training steps that separately optimize pixel dependency, text-image alignment, and image aesthetic quality; (2) Efficient T2I Transformer: We incorporate cross-attention modules into Diffusion Transformer (DiT) to inject text conditions and streamline the computation-intensive class-condition branch; (3) High-informative data: We emphasize the significance of concept density in text-image pairs and leverage a large Vision-Language model to auto-label dense pseudo-captions to assist text-image alignment learning. As a result, PIXART-$\alpha$'s training speed markedly surpasses existing large-scale T2I models, e.g., PIXART-$\alpha$ only takes 10.8% of Stable Diffusion v1.5's training time (675 vs. 6,250 A100 GPU days), saving nearly \$300,000 (\$26,000 vs. \$320,000) and reducing 90% CO2 emissions. Moreover, compared with a larger SOTA model, RAPHAEL, our training cost is merely 1%. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PIXART-$\alpha$ excels in image quality, artistry, and semantic control. We hope PIXART-$\alpha$ will provide new insights to the AIGC community and startups to accelerate building their own high-quality yet low-cost generative models from scratch.

**ABSTRACT**  
Controlling the degree of stylization in the Neural Style Transfer (NST) is a little tricky since it usually needs hand-engineering on hyper-parameters. In this paper, we propose the first deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) based architecture that splits one-step style transfer into a step-wise process for the NST task. Our RL-based method tends to preserve more details and structures of the content image in early steps, and synthesize more style patterns in later steps. It is a user-easily-controlled style-transfer method. Additionally, as our RL-based model performs the stylization progressively, it is lightweight and has lower computational complexity than existing one-step Deep Learning (DL) based models. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method.

**ABSTRACT**  
Although the majority of recent autonomous driving systems concentrate on developing perception methods based on ego-vehicle sensors, there is an overlooked alternative approach that involves leveraging intelligent roadside cameras to help extend the ego-vehicle perception ability beyond the visual range. We discover that most existing monocular 3D object detectors rely on the ego-vehicle prior assumption that the optical axis of the camera is parallel to the ground. However, the roadside camera is installed on a pole with a pitched angle, which makes the existing methods not optimal for roadside scenes. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for Roadside Monocular 3D object detection with ground-aware embeddings, named MonoGAE. Specifically, the ground plane is a stable and strong prior knowledge due to the fixed installation of cameras in roadside scenarios. In order to reduce the domain gap between the ground geometry information and high-dimensional image features, we employ a supervised training paradigm with a ground plane to predict high-dimensional ground-aware embeddings. These embeddings are subsequently integrated with image features through cross-attention mechanisms. Furthermore, to improve the detector's robustness to the divergences in cameras' installation poses, we replace the ground plane depth map with a novel pixel-level refined ground plane equation map. Our approach demonstrates a substantial performance advantage over all previous monocular 3D object detectors on widely recognized 3D detection benchmarks for roadside cameras. The code and pre-trained models will be released soon.

**ABSTRACT**  
Obtaining annotations for complex computer vision tasks such as object detection is an expensive and time-intense endeavor involving a large number of human workers or expert opinions. Reducing the amount of annotations required while maintaining algorithm performance is, therefore, desirable for machine learning practitioners and has been successfully achieved by active learning algorithms. However, it is not merely the amount of annotations which influences model performance but also the annotation quality. In practice, the oracles that are queried for new annotations frequently contain significant amounts of noise. Therefore, cleansing procedures are oftentimes necessary to review and correct given labels. This process is subject to the same budget as the initial annotation itself since it requires human workers or even domain experts. Here, we propose a composite active learning framework including a label review module for deep object detection. We show that utilizing part of the annotation budget to correct the noisy annotations partially in the active dataset leads to early improvements in model performance, especially when coupled with uncertainty-based query strategies. The precision of the label error proposals has a significant influence on the measured effect of the label review. In our experiments we achieve improvements of up to 4.5 mAP points of object detection performance by incorporating label reviews at equal annotation budget.

**ABSTRACT**  
With the rapid development of computer vision, Vision Transformers (ViTs) offer the tantalizing prospect of unified information processing across visual and textual domains. But due to the lack of inherent inductive biases in ViTs, they require enormous amount of data for training. To make their applications practical, we introduce an innovative ensemble-based distillation approach distilling inductive bias from complementary lightweight teacher models. Prior systems relied solely on convolution-based teaching. However, this method incorporates an ensemble of light teachers with different architectural tendencies, such as convolution and involution, to instruct the student transformer jointly. Because of these unique inductive biases, instructors can accumulate a wide range of knowledge, even from readily identifiable stored datasets, which leads to enhanced student performance. Our proposed framework also involves precomputing and storing logits in advance, essentially the unnormalized predictions of the model. This optimization can accelerate the distillation process by eliminating the need for repeated forward passes during knowledge distillation, significantly reducing the computational burden and enhancing efficiency.

**ABSTRACT**  
Within the framework of generative adversarial networks (GANs), we propose objectives that task the discriminator for self-supervised representation learning via additional structural modeling responsibilities. In combination with an efficient smoothness regularizer imposed on the network, these objectives guide the discriminator to learn to extract informative representations, while maintaining a generator capable of sampling from the domain. Specifically, our objectives encourage the discriminator to structure features at two levels of granularity: aligning distribution characteristics, such as mean and variance, at coarse scales, and grouping features into local clusters at finer scales. Operating as a feature learner within the GAN framework frees our self-supervised system from the reliance on hand-crafted data augmentation schemes that are prevalent across contrastive representation learning methods. Across CIFAR-10/100 and an ImageNet subset, experiments demonstrate that equipping GANs with our self-supervised objectives suffices to produce discriminators which, evaluated in terms of representation learning, compete with networks trained by contrastive learning approaches.

**ABSTRACT**  
Background: Dental caries diagnosis requires the manual inspection of diagnostic bitewing images of the patient, followed by a visual inspection and probing of the identified dental pieces with potential lesions. Yet the use of artificial intelligence, and in particular deep-learning, has the potential to aid in the diagnosis by providing a quick and informative analysis of the bitewing images.   Methods: A dataset of 13,887 bitewings from the HUNT4 Oral Health Study were annotated individually by six different experts, and used to train three different object detection deep-learning architectures: RetinaNet (ResNet50), YOLOv5 (M size), and EfficientDet (D0 and D1 sizes). A consensus dataset of 197 images, annotated jointly by the same six dentist, was used for evaluation. A five-fold cross validation scheme was used to evaluate the performance of the AI models.   Results: the trained models show an increase in average precision and F1-score, and decrease of false negative rate, with respect to the dental clinicians. Out of the three architectures studied, YOLOv5 shows the largest improvement, reporting 0.647 mean average precision, 0.548 mean F1-score, and 0.149 mean false negative rate. Whereas the best annotators on each of these metrics reported 0.299, 0.495, and 0.164 respectively.   Conclusion: Deep-learning models have shown the potential to assist dental professionals in the diagnosis of caries. Yet, the task remains challenging due to the artifacts natural to the bitewings.

**ABSTRACT**  
A vast majority of conventional augmented reality devices are equipped with depth sensors. Depth images produced by such sensors contain complementary information for object detection when used with color images. Despite the benefits, it remains a complex task to simultaneously extract photometric and depth features in real time due to the immanent difference between depth and color images. Moreover, standard convolution operations are not sufficient to properly extract information directly from raw depth images leading to intermediate representations of depth which is inefficient. To address these issues, we propose a real-time and two stream RGBD object detection model. The proposed model consists of two new components: a depth guided hyper-involution that adapts dynamically based on the spatial interaction pattern in the raw depth map and an up-sampling based trainable fusion layer that combines the extracted depth and color image features without blocking the information transfer between them. We show that the proposed model outperforms other RGB-D based object detection models on NYU Depth v2 dataset and achieves comparable (second best) results on SUN RGB-D. Additionally, we introduce a new outdoor RGB-D object detection dataset where our proposed model outperforms other models. The performance evaluation on diverse synthetic data generated from CAD models and images shows the potential of the proposed model to be adapted to augmented reality based applications.

**ABSTRACT**  
We proposed an easy method of Zero-Shot semantic segmentation by using style transfer. In this case, we successfully used a medical imaging dataset (Blood Cell Imagery) to train a model for river ice semantic segmentation. First, we built a river ice semantic segmentation dataset IPC_RI_SEG using a fixed camera and covering the entire ice melting process of the river. Second, a high-resolution texture fusion semantic segmentation network named IceHrNet is proposed. The network used HRNet as the backbone and added ASPP and Decoder segmentation heads to retain low-level texture features for fine semantic segmentation. Finally, a simple and effective advanced style transfer learning strategy was proposed, which can perform zero-shot transfer learning based on cross-domain semantic segmentation datasets, achieving a practical effect of 87% mIoU for semantic segmentation of river ice without target training dataset (25% mIoU for None Stylized, 65% mIoU for Conventional Stylized, our strategy improved by 22%). Experiments showed that the IceHrNet outperformed the state-of-the-art methods on the texture-focused dataset IPC_RI_SEG, and achieved an excellent result on the shape-focused river ice datasets. In zero-shot transfer learning, IceHrNet achieved an increase of 2 percentage points compared to other methods. Our code and model are published on https://github.com/PL23K/IceHrNet.

**ABSTRACT**  
Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS), a fundamental computer vision task, which aims to segment out the object within only class-level labels. The traditional methods adopt the CNN-based network and utilize the class activation map (CAM) strategy to discover the object regions. However, such methods only focus on the most discriminative region of the object, resulting in incomplete segmentation. An alternative is to explore vision transformers (ViT) to encode the image to acquire the global semantic information. Yet, the lack of transductive bias to objects is a flaw of ViT. In this paper, we explore the dual-augmented transformer network with self-regularization constraints for WSSS. Specifically, we propose a dual network with both CNN-based and transformer networks for mutually complementary learning, where both networks augment the final output for enhancement. Massive systemic evaluations on the challenging PASCAL VOC 2012 benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods.

**ABSTRACT**  
Rigid pre-registration involving local-global matching or other large deformation scenarios is crucial. Current popular methods rely on unsupervised learning based on grayscale similarity, but under circumstances where different poses lead to varying tissue structures, or where image quality is poor, these methods tend to exhibit instability and inaccuracies. In this study, we propose a novel method for medical image registration based on arbitrary voxel point of interest matching, called query point quizzer (QUIZ). QUIZ focuses on the correspondence between local-global matching points, specifically employing CNN for feature extraction and utilizing the Transformer architecture for global point matching queries, followed by applying average displacement for local image rigid transformation. We have validated this approach on a large deformation dataset of cervical cancer patients, with results indicating substantially smaller deviations compared to state-of-the-art methods. Remarkably, even for cross-modality subjects, it achieves results surpassing the current state-of-the-art.

**ABSTRACT**  
Data-Free Knowledge Distillation (DFKD) has recently made remarkable advancements with its core principle of transferring knowledge from a teacher neural network to a student neural network without requiring access to the original data. Nonetheless, existing approaches encounter a significant challenge when attempting to generate samples from random noise inputs, which inherently lack meaningful information. Consequently, these models struggle to effectively map this noise to the ground-truth sample distribution, resulting in the production of low-quality data and imposing substantial time requirements for training the generator. In this paper, we propose a novel Noisy Layer Generation method (NAYER) which relocates the randomness source from the input to a noisy layer and utilizes the meaningful label-text embedding (LTE) as the input. The significance of LTE lies in its ability to contain substantial meaningful inter-class information, enabling the generation of high-quality samples with only a few training steps. Simultaneously, the noisy layer plays a key role in addressing the issue of diversity in sample generation by preventing the model from overemphasizing the constrained label information. By reinitializing the noisy layer in each iteration, we aim to facilitate the generation of diverse samples while still retaining the method's efficiency, thanks to the ease of learning provided by LTE. Experiments carried out on multiple datasets demonstrate that our NAYER not only outperforms the state-of-the-art methods but also achieves speeds 5 to 15 times faster than previous approaches.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recently, pre-trained vision-language models have been increasingly used to tackle the challenging zero-shot segmentation task. Typical solutions follow the paradigm of first generating mask proposals and then adopting CLIP to classify them. To maintain the CLIP's zero-shot transferability, previous practices favour to freeze CLIP during training. However, in the paper, we reveal that CLIP is insensitive to different mask proposals and tends to produce similar predictions for various mask proposals of the same image. This insensitivity results in numerous false positives when classifying mask proposals. This issue mainly relates to the fact that CLIP is trained with image-level supervision. To alleviate this issue, we propose a simple yet effective method, named Mask-aware Fine-tuning (MAFT). Specifically, Image-Proposals CLIP Encoder (IP-CLIP Encoder) is proposed to handle arbitrary numbers of image and mask proposals simultaneously. Then, mask-aware loss and self-distillation loss are designed to fine-tune IP-CLIP Encoder, ensuring CLIP is responsive to different mask proposals while not sacrificing transferability. In this way, mask-aware representations can be easily learned to make the true positives stand out. Notably, our solution can seamlessly plug into most existing methods without introducing any new parameters during the fine-tuning process. We conduct extensive experiments on the popular zero-shot benchmarks. With MAFT, the performance of the state-of-the-art methods is promoted by a large margin: 50.4% (+ 8.2%) on COCO, 81.8% (+ 3.2%) on Pascal-VOC, and 8.7% (+4.3%) on ADE20K in terms of mIoU for unseen classes.

**ABSTRACT**  
The capacity of a modern deep learning system to determine if a sample falls within its realm of knowledge is fundamental and important. In this paper, we offer insights and analyses of recent state-of-the-art out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods - extremely simple activation shaping (ASH). We demonstrate that activation pruning has a detrimental effect on OOD detection, while activation scaling enhances it. Moreover, we propose SCALE, a simple yet effective post-hoc network enhancement method for OOD detection, which attains state-of-the-art OOD detection performance without compromising in-distribution (ID) accuracy. By integrating scaling concepts into the training process to capture a sample's ID characteristics, we propose Intermediate Tensor SHaping (ISH), a lightweight method for training time OOD detection enhancement. We achieve AUROC scores of +1.85\% for near-OOD and +0.74\% for far-OOD datasets on the OpenOOD v1.5 ImageNet-1K benchmark. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/kai422/SCALE.

**ABSTRACT**  
Interpretability is a key issue when applying deep learning models to longitudinal brain MRIs. One way to address this issue is by visualizing the high-dimensional latent spaces generated by deep learning via self-organizing maps (SOM). SOM separates the latent space into clusters and then maps the cluster centers to a discrete (typically 2D) grid preserving the high-dimensional relationship between clusters. However, learning SOM in a high-dimensional latent space tends to be unstable, especially in a self-supervision setting. Furthermore, the learned SOM grid does not necessarily capture clinically interesting information, such as brain age. To resolve these issues, we propose the first self-supervised SOM approach that derives a high-dimensional, interpretable representation stratified by brain age solely based on longitudinal brain MRIs (i.e., without demographic or cognitive information). Called Longitudinally-consistent Self-Organized Representation learning (LSOR), the method is stable during training as it relies on soft clustering (vs. the hard cluster assignments used by existing SOM). Furthermore, our approach generates a latent space stratified according to brain age by aligning trajectories inferred from longitudinal MRIs to the reference vector associated with the corresponding SOM cluster. When applied to longitudinal MRIs of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI, N=632), LSOR generates an interpretable latent space and achieves comparable or higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art representations with respect to the downstream tasks of classification (static vs. progressive mild cognitive impairment) and regression (determining ADAS-Cog score of all subjects). The code is available at https://github.com/ouyangjiahong/longitudinal-som-single-modality.

**ABSTRACT**  
Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success, demonstrating powerful instruction-following capabilities across diverse tasks. Instruction fine-tuning is critical in enabling LLMs to align with user intentions and effectively follow instructions. In this work, we investigate how instruction fine-tuning modifies pre-trained models, focusing on two perspectives: instruction recognition and knowledge evolution. To study the behavior shift of LLMs, we employ a suite of local and global explanation methods, including a gradient-based approach for input-output attribution and techniques for interpreting patterns and concepts in self-attention and feed-forward layers. Our findings reveal three significant impacts of instruction fine-tuning: 1) It empowers LLMs to better recognize the instruction parts from user prompts, thereby facilitating high-quality response generation and addressing the ``lost-in-the-middle'' issue observed in pre-trained models; 2) It aligns the knowledge stored in feed-forward layers with user-oriented tasks, exhibiting minimal shifts across linguistic levels. 3) It facilitates the learning of word-word relations with instruction verbs through the self-attention mechanism, particularly in the lower and middle layers, indicating enhanced recognition of instruction words. These insights contribute to a deeper understanding of the behavior shifts in LLMs after instruction fine-tuning and lay the groundwork for future research aimed at interpreting and optimizing LLMs for various applications. We will release our code and data soon.

**ABSTRACT**  
Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive inferential capabilities, with numerous research endeavors devoted to enhancing this capacity through prompting. Despite these efforts, a unified epistemological foundation is still conspicuously absent. Drawing inspiration from Kant's a priori philosophy, we propose the UPAR prompting framework, designed to emulate the structure of human cognition within LLMs. The UPAR framework is delineated into four phases: "Understand", "Plan", "Act", and "Reflect", enabling the extraction of structured information from complex contexts, prior planning of solutions, execution according to plan, and self-reflection. This structure significantly augments the explainability and accuracy of LLM inference, producing a human-understandable and inspectable inferential trajectory. Furthermore, our work offers an epistemological foundation for existing prompting techniques, allowing for a possible systematic integration of these methods. With GPT-4, our approach elevates the accuracy from COT baseline of 22.92% to 58.33% in a challenging subset of GSM8K, and from 67.91% to 75.40% in the causal judgment task.

**ABSTRACT**  
Existing dialogue quality evaluation systems can return a score for a given system turn from a particular viewpoint, e.g., engagingness. However, to improve dialogue systems by locating exactly where in a system turn potential problems lie, a more fine-grained evaluation may be necessary. We therefore propose an evaluation approach where a turn is decomposed into nuggets (i.e., expressions associated with a dialogue act), and nugget-level evaluation is enabled by leveraging an existing turn-level evaluation system. We demonstrate the potential effectiveness of our evaluation method through a case study.

**ABSTRACT**  
In-Context Learning (ICL) is a new paradigm for natural language processing (NLP), where a large language model (LLM) observes a small number of demonstrations and a test instance as its input, and directly makes predictions without updating model parameters. Previous studies have revealed that ICL is sensitive to the selection and the ordering of demonstrations. However, there are few studies regarding the impact of the demonstration number on the ICL performance within a limited input length of LLM, because it is commonly believed that the number of demonstrations is positively correlated with model performance. In this paper, we found this conclusion does not always hold true. Through pilot experiments, we discover that increasing the number of demonstrations does not necessarily lead to improved performance. Building upon this insight, we propose a Dynamic Demonstrations Controller (D$^2$Controller), which can improve the ICL performance by adjusting the number of demonstrations dynamically. The experimental results show that D$^2$Controller yields a 5.4% relative improvement on eight different sizes of LLMs across ten datasets. Moreover, we also extend our method to previous ICL models and achieve competitive results.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have heightened concerns about their potential misalignment with human values. However, evaluating their grasp of these values is complex due to their intricate and adaptable nature. We argue that truly understanding values in LLMs requires considering both "know what" and "know why". To this end, we present the Value Understanding Measurement (VUM) framework that quantitatively assess both "know what" and "know why" by measuring the discriminator-critique gap related to human values. Using the Schwartz Value Survey, we specify our evaluation values and develop a thousand-level dialogue dataset with GPT-4. Our assessment looks at both the value alignment of LLM's outputs compared to baseline answers and how LLM responses align with reasons for value recognition versus GPT-4's annotations. We evaluate five representative LLMs and provide strong evidence that the scaling law significantly impacts "know what" but not much on "know why", which has consistently maintained a high level. This may further suggest that LLMs might craft plausible explanations based on the provided context without truly understanding their inherent value, indicating potential risks.

**ABSTRACT**  
Generating bitmap graphics from text has gained considerable attention, yet for scientific figures, vector graphics are often preferred. Given that vector graphics are typically encoded using low-level graphics primitives, generating them directly is difficult. To address this, we propose the use of TikZ, a well-known abstract graphics language that can be compiled to vector graphics, as an intermediate representation of scientific figures. TikZ offers human-oriented, high-level commands, thereby facilitating conditional language modeling with any large language model. To this end, we introduce DaTikZ the first large-scale TikZ dataset, consisting of 120k TikZ drawings aligned with captions. We fine-tune LLaMA on DaTikZ, as well as our new model CLiMA, which augments LLaMA with multimodal CLIP embeddings. In both human and automatic evaluation, CLiMA and LLaMA outperform commercial GPT-4 and Claude 2 in terms of similarity to human-created figures, with CLiMA additionally improving text-image alignment. Our detailed analysis shows that all models generalize well and are not susceptible to memorization. GPT-4 and Claude 2, however, tend to generate more simplistic figures compared to both humans and our models. We make our framework, AutomaTikZ, along with model weights and datasets, publicly available.

**ABSTRACT**  
Language learners should regularly engage in reading challenging materials as part of their study routine. Nevertheless, constantly referring to dictionaries is time-consuming and distracting. This paper presents a novel gaze-driven sentence simplification system designed to enhance reading comprehension while maintaining their focus on the content. Our system incorporates machine learning models tailored to individual learners, combining eye gaze features and linguistic features to assess sentence comprehension. When the system identifies comprehension difficulties, it provides simplified versions by replacing complex vocabulary and grammar with simpler alternatives via GPT-3.5. We conducted an experiment with 19 English learners, collecting data on their eye movements while reading English text. The results demonstrated that our system is capable of accurately estimating sentence-level comprehension. Additionally, we found that GPT-3.5 simplification improved readability in terms of traditional readability metrics and individual word difficulty, paraphrasing across different linguistic levels.

**ABSTRACT**  
Detecting bias in text is crucial due to its potential implications in perpetuating harmful stereotypes, spreading misinformation, and influencing decision-making. Existing language models often struggle to generalize beyond their training data. To address this challenge, we propose the Contextualized Bi-Directional Dual Transformer (CBDT) Classifier that leverages two interconnected transformer networks, the Context Transformer and the Entity Transformer, to detect bias in text. Experimental results on diverse datasets demonstrate the superiority of the CBDT classifier in accurately classifying biased and non-biased sentences, as well as identifying specific biased words and phrases. We get a performance gain of about 2-4% over the baselines. Future research can extend the model to different languages and cultural contexts

**ABSTRACT**  
Deployable Large Language Models (LLMs) must conform to the criterion of helpfulness and harmlessness, thereby achieving consistency between LLMs outputs and human values. Red-teaming techniques constitute a critical way towards this criterion. Existing work rely solely on manual red team designs and heuristic adversarial prompts for vulnerability detection and optimization. These approaches lack rigorous mathematical formulation, thus limiting the exploration of diverse attack strategy within quantifiable measure and optimization of LLMs under convergence guarantees. In this paper, we present Red-teaming Game (RTG), a general game-theoretic framework without manual annotation. RTG is designed for analyzing the multi-turn attack and defense interactions between Red-team language Models (RLMs) and Blue-team Language Model (BLM). Within the RTG, we propose Gamified Red-teaming Solver (GRTS) with diversity measure of the semantic space. GRTS is an automated red teaming technique to solve RTG towards Nash equilibrium through meta-game analysis, which corresponds to the theoretically guaranteed optimization direction of both RLMs and BLM. Empirical results in multi-turn attacks with RLMs show that GRTS autonomously discovered diverse attack strategies and effectively improved security of LLMs, outperforming existing heuristic red-team designs. Overall, RTG has established a foundational framework for red teaming tasks and constructed a new scalable oversight technique for alignment.

**ABSTRACT**  
Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable performance improvement through in-context learning (ICL) by leveraging task-specific examples in the input. However, the mechanisms behind this improvement remain elusive. In this work, we investigate how LLM embeddings and attention representations change following in-context-learning, and how these changes mediate improvement in behavior. We employ neuroscience-inspired techniques such as representational similarity analysis (RSA) and propose novel methods for parameterized probing and measuring ratio of attention to relevant vs. irrelevant information in Llama-2 70B and Vicuna 13B. We designed three tasks with a priori relationships among their conditions: reading comprehension, linear regression, and adversarial prompt injection. We formed hypotheses about expected similarities in task representations to investigate latent changes in embeddings and attention. Our analyses revealed a meaningful correlation between changes in both embeddings and attention representations with improvements in behavioral performance after ICL. This empirical framework empowers a nuanced understanding of how latent representations affect LLM behavior with and without ICL, offering valuable tools and insights for future research and practical applications.

**ABSTRACT**  
While large pre-trained language models (LLMs) have shown their impressive capabilities in various NLP tasks, they are still under-explored in the misinformation domain. In this paper, we examine LLMs with in-context learning (ICL) for news claim verification, and find that only with 4-shot demonstration examples, the performance of several prompting methods can be comparable with previous supervised models. To further boost performance, we introduce a Hierarchical Step-by-Step (HiSS) prompting method which directs LLMs to separate a claim into several subclaims and then verify each of them via multiple questions-answering steps progressively. Experiment results on two public misinformation datasets show that HiSS prompting outperforms state-of-the-art fully-supervised approach and strong few-shot ICL-enabled baselines.

**ABSTRACT**  
Many applications need access to background knowledge about how different concepts and entities are related. Although Knowledge Graphs (KG) and Large Language Models (LLM) can address this need to some extent, KGs are inevitably incomplete and their relational schema is often too coarse-grained, while LLMs are inefficient and difficult to control. As an alternative, we propose to extract relation embeddings from relatively small language models. In particular, we show that masked language models such as RoBERTa can be straightforwardly fine-tuned for this purpose, using only a small amount of training data. The resulting model, which we call RelBERT, captures relational similarity in a surprisingly fine-grained way, allowing us to set a new state-of-the-art in analogy benchmarks. Crucially, RelBERT is capable of modelling relations that go well beyond what the model has seen during training. For instance, we obtained strong results on relations between named entities with a model that was only trained on lexical relations between concepts, and we observed that RelBERT can recognise morphological analogies despite not being trained on such examples. Overall, we find that RelBERT significantly outperforms strategies based on prompting language models that are several orders of magnitude larger, including recent GPT-based models and open source models.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper explores the elusive mechanism underpinning in-context learning in Large Language Models (LLMs). Our work provides a novel perspective by examining in-context learning via the lens of surface repetitions. We quantitatively investigate the role of surface features in text generation, and empirically establish the existence of \emph{token co-occurrence reinforcement}, a principle that strengthens the relationship between two tokens based on their contextual co-occurrences. By investigating the dual impacts of these features, our research illuminates the internal workings of in-context learning and expounds on the reasons for its failures. This paper provides an essential contribution to the understanding of in-context learning and its potential limitations, providing a fresh perspective on this exciting capability.

**ABSTRACT**  
Africa has a very low doctor-to-patient ratio. At very busy clinics, doctors could see 30+ patients per day -- a heavy patient burden compared with developed countries -- but productivity tools such as clinical automatic speech recognition (ASR) are lacking for these overworked clinicians. However, clinical ASR is mature, even ubiquitous, in developed nations, and clinician-reported performance of commercial clinical ASR systems is generally satisfactory. Furthermore, the recent performance of general domain ASR is approaching human accuracy. However, several gaps exist. Several publications have highlighted racial bias with speech-to-text algorithms and performance on minority accents lags significantly. To our knowledge, there is no publicly available research or benchmark on accented African clinical ASR, and speech data is non-existent for the majority of African accents. We release AfriSpeech, 200hrs of Pan-African English speech, 67,577 clips from 2,463 unique speakers across 120 indigenous accents from 13 countries for clinical and general domain ASR, a benchmark test set, with publicly available pre-trained models with SOTA performance on the AfriSpeech benchmark.

**ABSTRACT**  
Large Language Models, such as Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (aka. GPT-3), have been developed to understand language through the analysis of extensive text data, allowing them to identify patterns and connections between words. While LLMs have demonstrated impressive performance across various text-related tasks, they encounter challenges in tasks associated with reasoning. To address this challenge, Chain of Thought(CoT) prompting method has been proposed as a means to enhance LLMs' proficiency in complex reasoning tasks like solving math word problems and answering questions based on logical argumentative reasoning. The primary aim of this research is to assess how well four language models can grade reflective essays of third-year medical students. The assessment will specifically target the evaluation of critical thinking skills using CoT prompting.   The research will provide the following contributions; to introduce and educate on the process of instructing models to evaluate reflective essays from a dataset they have not been previously trained on; to illustrate the use of CoT prompting as an instructional approach for training large models to carry out particular tasks. Our results suggest that among all the models, Llama-7b performs the least effectively, displaying the highest mean squared error. Conversely, ChatGPT emerges as the superior model, boasting a higher Cohen kappa score value of 0.53. Lastly, it's important to note that the selected models do prioritise user privacy by allowing users to delete their own conducted conversations.

**ABSTRACT**  
While Large language models (LLMs) have garnered widespread applications across various domains due to their powerful language understanding and generation capabilities, the detection of non-factual or hallucinatory content generated by LLMs remains scarce. Currently, one significant challenge in hallucination detection is the laborious task of time-consuming and expensive manual annotation of the hallucinatory generation. To address this issue, this paper first introduces a method for automatically constructing model-specific hallucination datasets based on existing fact-checking datasets called AutoHall. Furthermore, we propose a zero-resource and black-box hallucination detection method based on self-contradiction. We conduct experiments towards prevalent open-/closed-source LLMs, achieving superior hallucination detection performance compared to extant baselines. Moreover, our experiments reveal variations in hallucination proportions and types among different models.

**ABSTRACT**  
We present a joint Speech and Language Model (SLM), a multitask, multilingual, and dual-modal model that takes advantage of pretrained foundational speech and language models. SLM freezes the pretrained foundation models to maximally preserves their capabilities, and only trains a simple adapter with just 1\% (156M) of the foundation models' parameters. This adaptation not only leads SLM to achieve strong performance on conventional tasks such as speech recognition (ASR) and speech translation (AST), but also introduces the novel capability of zero-shot instruction-following for more diverse tasks: given a speech input and a text instruction, SLM is able to perform unseen generation tasks including contextual biasing ASR using real-time context, dialog generation, speech continuation, and question answering, etc. Our approach demonstrates that the representational gap between pretrained speech and language models might be narrower than one would expect, and can be bridged by a simple adaptation mechanism. As a result, SLM is not only efficient to train, but also inherits strong capabilities already acquired in foundation models of different modalities.

**ABSTRACT**  
Unit testing is a commonly-used approach in software engineering to test the correctness and robustness of written code. Unit tests are tests designed to test small components of a codebase in isolation, such as an individual function or method. Although unit tests have historically been written by human programmers, recent advancements in AI, particularly LLMs, have shown corresponding advances in automatic unit test generation. In this study, we explore the effect of different prompts on the quality of unit tests generated by Code Interpreter, a GPT-4-based LLM, on Python functions provided by the Quixbugs dataset, and we focus on prompting due to the ease with which users can make use of our findings and observations. We find that the quality of the generated unit tests is not sensitive to changes in minor details in the prompts provided. However, we observe that Code Interpreter is often able to effectively identify and correct mistakes in code that it writes, suggesting that providing it runnable code to check the correctness of its outputs would be beneficial, even though we find that it is already often able to generate correctly-formatted unit tests. Our findings suggest that, when prompting models similar to Code Interpreter, it is important to include the basic information necessary to generate unit tests, but minor details are not as important.

**ABSTRACT**  
Many Transformer-based pre-trained models for code have been developed and applied to code-related tasks. In this paper, we review the existing literature, examine the suitability of model architectures for different tasks, and look at the generalization ability of models on different datasets, and their resource consumption.   We examine three very representative pre-trained models for code: CodeBERT, CodeGPT, and CodeT5, and conduct experiments on the top-4 most targeted software engineering tasks that we found in our literature survey: Code Summarization, Bug Fixing, Bug Detection, and Code Search. In our study, we showcase the capability of decoder-only models (CodeGPT) for specific generation tasks under state-of-the-art evaluation metrics and contest the common belief that the encoder-decoder architecture is optimal for general-purpose coding tasks. Additionally, we found that the most frequently used models are not necessarily the most suitable for certain applications and the developers' needs are not adequately addressed by current research. As well, we found that the benchmark and frequent dataset for Bug Fixing and Code Summarization both fail to enable models to generalize onto other datasets for the same task (the frequent dataset refers to the dataset with the highest frequency used in literature other than the benchmark). We use statistical testing to support our conclusions from experiments. Finally, CodeBERT is highly efficient for understanding tasks, whereas CodeT5's efficiency for generation tasks is in doubt, as the highest resource consumption does not guarantee a consistent better performance on different metrics. We also discuss the numerous practical issues in advancing future research on transformer-based models for code-related tasks.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper performs the first study to understand the prevalence, challenges, and effectiveness of using Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools on Open-Source Embedded Software (EMBOSS) repositories. We collect a corpus of 258 of the most popular EMBOSS projects, representing 13 distinct categories such as real-time operating systems, network stacks, and applications. To understand the current use of SAST tools on EMBOSS, we measured this corpus and surveyed developers. To understand the challenges and effectiveness of using SAST tools on EMBOSS projects, we applied these tools to the projects in our corpus. We report that almost none of these projects (just 3%) use SAST tools beyond those baked into the compiler, and developers give rationales such as ineffectiveness and false positives. In applying SAST tools ourselves, we show that minimal engineering effort and project expertise are needed to apply many tools to a given EMBOSS project. GitHub's CodeQL was the most effective SAST tool -- using its built-in security checks we found a total of 540 defects (with a false positive rate of 23%) across the 258 projects, with 399 (74%) likely security vulnerabilities, including in projects maintained by Microsoft, Amazon, and the Apache Foundation. EMBOSS engineers have confirmed 273 (51%) of these defects, mainly by accepting our pull requests. Two CVEs were issued. In summary, we urge EMBOSS engineers to adopt the current generation of SAST tools, which offer low false positive rates and are effective at finding security-relevant defects.

**ABSTRACT**  
Robotic locomotion is a challenging task, especially in unstructured terrains. In practice, the optimal locomotion policy can be context-dependent by using the contextual information of encountered terrains in decision-making. Humans can interpret the environmental context for robots, but the ambiguity of human language makes it challenging to use in robot locomotion directly. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, LANCAR, that introduces a context translator that works with reinforcement learning (RL) agents for context-aware locomotion. Our formulation allows a robot to interpret the contextual information from environments generated by human observers or Vision-Language Models (VLM) with Large Language Models (LLM) and use this information to generate contextual embeddings. We incorporate the contextual embeddings with the robot's internal environmental observations as the input to the RL agent's decision neural network. We evaluate LANCAR with contextual information in varying ambiguity levels and compare its performance using several alternative approaches. Our experimental results demonstrate that our approach exhibits good generalizability and adaptability across diverse terrains, by achieving at least 10% of performance improvement in episodic reward over baselines.

**ABSTRACT**  
Heart failure (HF) is a critical condition in which the accurate prediction of mortality plays a vital role in guiding patient management decisions. However, clinical datasets used for mortality prediction in HF often suffer from an imbalanced distribution of classes, posing significant challenges. In this paper, we explore preprocessing methods for enhancing one-month mortality prediction in HF patients. We present a comprehensive preprocessing framework including scaling, outliers processing and resampling as key techniques. We also employed an aware encoding approach to effectively handle missing values in clinical datasets. Our study utilizes a comprehensive dataset from the Persian Registry Of cardio Vascular disease (PROVE) with a significant class imbalance. By leveraging appropriate preprocessing techniques and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, we aim to improve mortality prediction performance for HF patients. The results reveal an average enhancement of approximately 3.6% in F1 score and 2.7% in MCC for tree-based models, specifically Random Forest (RF) and XGBoost (XGB). This demonstrates the efficiency of our preprocessing approach in effectively handling Imbalanced Clinical Datasets (ICD). Our findings hold promise in guiding healthcare professionals to make informed decisions and improve patient outcomes in HF management.

**ABSTRACT**  
In recent years, there is strong emphasis on mining medical data using machine learning techniques. A common problem is to obtain a noiseless set of textual documents, with a relevant content for the research question, and developing a Question Answering (QA) model for a specific medical field. The purpose of this paper is to present a new methodology for building a medical dataset and obtain a QA model for analysis of symptoms and impact on daily life for a specific disease domain. The ``Mental Health'' forum was used, a forum dedicated to people suffering from schizophrenia and different mental disorders. Relevant posts of active users, who regularly participate, were extrapolated providing a new method of obtaining low-bias content and without privacy issues. Furthermore, it is shown how to pre-process the dataset to convert it into a QA dataset. The Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), DistilBERT, RoBERTa, and BioBERT models were fine-tuned and evaluated via F1-Score, Exact Match, Precision and Recall. Accurate empirical experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method for obtaining an accurate dataset for QA model implementation. By fine-tuning the BioBERT QA model, we achieved an F1 score of 0.885, showing a considerable improvement and outperforming the state-of-the-art model for mental disorders domain.

**ABSTRACT**  
As the capabilities of artificial agents improve, they are being increasingly deployed to service multiple diverse objectives and stakeholders. However, the composition of these objectives is often performed ad hoc, with no clear justification. This paper takes a normative approach to multi-objective agency: from a set of intuitively appealing axioms, it is shown that Markovian aggregation of Markovian reward functions is not possible when the time preference (discount factor) for each objective may vary. It follows that optimal multi-objective agents must admit rewards that are non-Markovian with respect to the individual objectives. To this end, a practical non-Markovian aggregation scheme is proposed, which overcomes the impossibility with only one additional parameter for each objective. This work offers new insights into sequential, multi-objective agency and intertemporal choice, and has practical implications for the design of AI systems deployed to serve multiple generations of principals with varying time preference.

**ABSTRACT**  
It is by now a well known fact in the graph learning community that the presence of bottlenecks severely limits the ability of graph neural networks to propagate information over long distances. What so far has not been appreciated is that, counter-intuitively, also the presence of strongly connected sub-graphs may severely restrict information flow in common architectures. Motivated by this observation, we introduce the concept of multi-scale consistency. At the node level this concept refers to the retention of a connected propagation graph even if connectivity varies over a given graph. At the graph-level, multi-scale consistency refers to the fact that distinct graphs describing the same object at different resolutions should be assigned similar feature vectors. As we show, both properties are not satisfied by poular graph neural network architectures. To remedy these shortcomings, we introduce ResolvNet, a flexible graph neural network based on the mathematical concept of resolvents. We rigorously establish its multi-scale consistency theoretically and verify it in extensive experiments on real world data: Here networks based on this ResolvNet architecture prove expressive; out-performing baselines significantly on many tasks; in- and outside the multi-scale setting.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recent works on SLAM extend their pose graphs with higher-level semantic concepts exploiting relationships between them, to provide, not only a richer representation of the situation/environment but also to improve the accuracy of its estimation. Concretely, our previous work, Situational Graphs (S-Graphs), a pioneer in jointly leveraging semantic relationships in the factor optimization process, relies on semantic entities such as wall surfaces and rooms, whose relationship is mathematically defined. Nevertheless, excerpting these high-level concepts relying exclusively on the lower-level factor-graph remains a challenge and it is currently done with ad-hoc algorithms, which limits its capability to include new semantic-relational concepts. To overcome this limitation, in this work, we propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN) for learning high-level semantic-relational concepts that can be inferred from the low-level factor graph. We have demonstrated that we can infer room entities and their relationship to the mapped wall surfaces, more accurately and more computationally efficient than the baseline algorithm. Additionally, to demonstrate the versatility of our method, we provide a new semantic concept, i.e. wall, and its relationship with its wall surfaces. Our proposed method has been integrated into S-Graphs+, and it has been validated in both simulated and real datasets. A docker container with our software will be made available to the scientific community.

**ABSTRACT**  
Intelligent systems possess a crucial characteristic of breaking complicated problems into smaller reusable components or parts and adjusting to new tasks using these part representations. However, current part-learners encounter difficulties in dealing with incidental correlations resulting from the limited observations of objects that may appear only in specific arrangements or with specific backgrounds. These incidental correlations may have a detrimental impact on the generalization and interpretability of learned part representations. This study asserts that part-based representations could be more interpretable and generalize better with limited data, employing two innovative regularization methods. The first regularization separates foreground and background information's generative process via a unique mixture-of-parts formulation. Structural constraints are imposed on the parts using a weakly-supervised loss, guaranteeing that the mixture-of-parts for foreground and background entails soft, object-agnostic masks. The second regularization assumes the form of a distillation loss, ensuring the invariance of the learned parts to the incidental background correlations. Furthermore, we incorporate sparse and orthogonal constraints to facilitate learning high-quality part representations. By reducing the impact of incidental background correlations on the learned parts, we exhibit state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance on few-shot learning tasks on benchmark datasets, including MiniImagenet, TieredImageNet, and FC100. We also demonstrate that the part-based representations acquired through our approach generalize better than existing techniques, even under domain shifts of the background and common data corruption on the ImageNet-9 dataset. The implementation is available on GitHub: https://github.com/GauravBh1010tt/DPViT.git

**ABSTRACT**  
Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) holds the promise of sample-efficient learning by utilizing a world model, which models how the environment works and typically encompasses components for two tasks: observation modeling and reward modeling. In this paper, through a dedicated empirical investigation, we gain a deeper understanding of the role each task plays in world models and uncover the overlooked potential of more efficient MBRL by harmonizing the interference between observation and reward modeling. Our key insight is that while prevalent approaches of explicit MBRL attempt to restore abundant details of the environment through observation models, it is difficult due to the environment's complexity and limited model capacity. On the other hand, reward models, while dominating in implicit MBRL and adept at learning task-centric dynamics, are inadequate for sample-efficient learning without richer learning signals. Capitalizing on these insights and discoveries, we propose a simple yet effective method, Harmony World Models (HarmonyWM), that introduces a lightweight harmonizer to maintain a dynamic equilibrium between the two tasks in world model learning. Our experiments on three visual control domains show that the base MBRL method equipped with HarmonyWM gains 10%-55% absolute performance boosts.

**ABSTRACT**  
Temporal heterogeneous networks (THNs) are evolving networks that characterize many real-world applications such as citation and events networks, recommender systems, and knowledge graphs. Although different Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been successfully applied to dynamic graphs, most of them only support homogeneous graphs or suffer from model design heavily influenced by specific THNs prediction tasks. Furthermore, there is a lack of temporal heterogeneous networked data in current standard graph benchmark datasets. Hence, in this work, we propose DURENDAL, a graph deep learning framework for THNs. DURENDAL can help to easily repurpose any heterogeneous graph learning model to evolving networks by combining design principles from snapshot-based and multirelational message-passing graph learning models. We introduce two different schemes to update embedding representations for THNs, discussing the strengths and weaknesses of both strategies. We also extend the set of benchmarks for TNHs by introducing two novel high-resolution temporal heterogeneous graph datasets derived from an emerging Web3 platform and a well-established e-commerce website. Overall, we conducted the experimental evaluation of the framework over four temporal heterogeneous network datasets on future link prediction tasks in an evaluation setting that takes into account the evolving nature of the data. Experiments show the prediction power of DURENDAL compared to current solutions for evolving and dynamic graphs, and the effectiveness of its model design.

**ABSTRACT**  
Anomaly detection is a critical task that involves the identification of data points that deviate from a predefined pattern, useful for fraud detection and related activities. Various techniques are employed for anomaly detection, but recent research indicates that deep learning methods, with their ability to discern intricate data patterns, are well-suited for this task. This study explores the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for anomaly detection in power generation plants. The dataset used in this investigation comprises fuel consumption records obtained from power generation plants operated by a telecommunications company. The data was initially collected in response to observed irregularities in the fuel consumption patterns of the generating sets situated at the company's base stations. The dataset was divided into anomalous and normal data points based on specific variables, with 64.88% classified as normal and 35.12% as anomalous. An analysis of feature importance, employing the random forest classifier, revealed that Running Time Per Day exhibited the highest relative importance. A GANs model was trained and fine-tuned both with and without data augmentation, with the goal of increasing the dataset size to enhance performance. The generator model consisted of five dense layers using the tanh activation function, while the discriminator comprised six dense layers, each integrated with a dropout layer to prevent overfitting. Following data augmentation, the model achieved an accuracy rate of 98.99%, compared to 66.45% before augmentation. This demonstrates that the model nearly perfectly classified data points into normal and anomalous categories, with the augmented data significantly enhancing the GANs' performance in anomaly detection. Consequently, this study recommends the use of GANs, particularly when using large datasets, for effective anomaly detection.

**ABSTRACT**  
Graph Neural Architecture Search (GNAS) has shown promising results in automatically designing graph neural networks. However, GNAS still requires intensive human labor with rich domain knowledge to design the search space and search strategy. In this paper, we integrate GPT-4 into GNAS and propose a new GPT-4 based Graph Neural Architecture Search method (GPT4GNAS for short). The basic idea of our method is to design a new class of prompts for GPT-4 to guide GPT-4 toward the generative task of graph neural architectures. The prompts consist of descriptions of the search space, search strategy, and search feedback of GNAS. By iteratively running GPT-4 with the prompts, GPT4GNAS generates more accurate graph neural networks with fast convergence. Experimental results show that embedding GPT-4 into GNAS outperforms the state-of-the-art GNAS methods.

**ABSTRACT**  
Generative data augmentation (GDA) has emerged as a promising technique to alleviate data scarcity in machine learning applications. This thesis presents a comprehensive survey and unified framework of the GDA landscape. We first provide an overview of GDA, discussing its motivation, taxonomy, and key distinctions from synthetic data generation. We then systematically analyze the critical aspects of GDA - selection of generative models, techniques to utilize them, data selection methodologies, validation approaches, and diverse applications. Our proposed unified framework categorizes the extensive GDA literature, revealing gaps such as the lack of universal benchmarks. The thesis summarises promising research directions, including , effective data selection, theoretical development for large-scale models' application in GDA and establishing a benchmark for GDA. By laying a structured foundation, this thesis aims to nurture more cohesive development and accelerate progress in the vital arena of generative data augmentation.

**ABSTRACT**  
Traditional Time-series Anomaly Detection (TAD) methods often struggle with the composite nature of complex time-series data and a diverse array of anomalies. We introduce TADNet, an end-to-end TAD model that leverages Seasonal-Trend Decomposition to link various types of anomalies to specific decomposition components, thereby simplifying the analysis of complex time-series and enhancing detection performance. Our training methodology, which includes pre-training on a synthetic dataset followed by fine-tuning, strikes a balance between effective decomposition and precise anomaly detection. Experimental validation on real-world datasets confirms TADNet's state-of-the-art performance across a diverse range of anomalies.

**ABSTRACT**  
Federated learning (FL) offers privacy-preserving decentralized machine learning, optimizing models at edge clients without sharing private data. Simultaneously, foundation models (FMs) have gained traction in the artificial intelligence (AI) community due to their exceptional performance across various tasks. However, integrating FMs into FL presents challenges, primarily due to their substantial size and intensive resource requirements. This is especially true when considering the resource heterogeneity in edge FL systems. We present an adaptive framework for Resource-aware Federated Foundation Models (RaFFM) to address these challenges. RaFFM introduces specialized model compression algorithms tailored for FL scenarios, such as salient parameter prioritization and high-performance subnetwork extraction. These algorithms enable dynamic scaling of given transformer-based FMs to fit heterogeneous resource constraints at the network edge during both FL's optimization and deployment stages. Experimental results demonstrate that RaFFM shows significant superiority in resource utilization efficiency and uses fewer resources to deploy FMs to FL. Despite the lower resource consumption, target models optimized by RaFFM achieve performance on par with traditional FL methods applied to full-sized FMs. This is evident across tasks in both natural language processing and computer vision domains.

**ABSTRACT**  
Large Language Models (LLMs) can acquire extensive world knowledge through pre-training on large corpora. However, due to exposure to low-quality data, LLMs may exhibit harmful behavior without aligning with human values. The dominant approach for steering LLMs towards beneficial behavior involves Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF), with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) serving as the default RL optimizer. Despite its effectiveness, PPO has limitations when optimizing rewards trained from comparison-based loss. Primarily, PPO is not invariant to equivalent reward functions containing identical preference information due to the need to calibrate the reward scale. Additionally, PPO's necessity for token-wise updates introduces complexity in both function approximation and algorithm design compared to trajectory-wise optimization. This paper proposes a new framework, reinforcement learning with relative feedback, and a novel trajectory-wise policy gradient algorithm, Pairwise Proximal Policy Optimization (P3O) that operates directly on comparative rewards. We show theoretically that P3O is invariant to equivalent rewards and avoids the complexity of PPO. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that P3O outperforms PPO in the KL-Reward trade-off and can align with human preferences as well as or better than prior methods. In summary, this work introduces a simpler yet effective approach for aligning LLMs to human preferences through relative feedback.

**ABSTRACT**  
Medical image analysis using computer-based algorithms has attracted considerable attention from the research community and achieved tremendous progress in the last decade. With recent advances in computing resources and availability of large-scale medical image datasets, many deep learning models have been developed for disease diagnosis from medical images. However, existing techniques focus on sub-tasks, e.g., disease classification and identification, individually, while there is a lack of a unified framework enabling multi-task diagnosis. Inspired by the capability of Vision Transformers in both local and global representation learning, we propose in this paper a new method, namely Multi-task Vision Transformer (MVC) for simultaneously classifying chest X-ray images and identifying affected regions from the input data. Our method is built upon the Vision Transformer but extends its learning capability in a multi-task setting. We evaluated our proposed method and compared it with existing baselines on a benchmark dataset of COVID-19 chest X-ray images. Experimental results verified the superiority of the proposed method over the baselines on both the image classification and affected region identification tasks.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this paper, we propose a method, named BRAU-Net, to solve the pubic symphysis-fetal head segmentation task. The method adopts a U-Net-like pure Transformer architecture with bi-level routing attention and skip connections, which effectively learns local-global semantic information. The proposed BRAU-Net was evaluated on transperineal Ultrasound images dataset from the pubic symphysis-fetal head segmentation and angle of progression (FH-PS-AOP) challenge. The results demonstrate that the proposed BRAU-Net achieves comparable a final score. The codes will be available at https://github.com/Caipengzhou/BRAU-Net.

**ABSTRACT**  
Case studies are typically used to teach 'ethics', but when the content of a course is focused on formulae and proofs, a case analysis and the knowledge, skills, and abilities they require can be distracting. Moreover, case analyses are typically focused narrowly on research issues: obtaining consent, dealing with research team members, and/or research policy violations. Not all students in quantitative courses plan to become researchers, and ethical practice of mathematics, statistics, data science, and computing is an essential topic regardless of the learner's career plans. While it is incorrect to treat 'social justice' as a proxy for 'ethical practice', the topic of 'social justice' may be more interesting to both students and instructors. This paper offers concrete recommendations for integrating social justice content into quantitative courses in ways that limit the burden of new knowledge, skills, and abilities but also support reproducible and actionable assessments. Five tools can be utilized to integrate social justice into a course in a way that also meets calls to integrate 'ethics'; minimizes the burden on instructors to create and grade new materials and assignments; minimizes the burden on learners to develop the skill set to complete a case analysis; and maximizes the likelihood that the ethics content will be embedded in the learners' cognitive representation of the knowledge being taught in the quantitative course. These tools are: a. Curriculum Development Guidelines b. 7-task Statistics and Data Science Pipeline c. ASA Ethical Guidelines for Statistical Practice d. Stakeholder Analysis e. 6-step Ethical Reasoning paradigm This paper discusses how to use these tools in quantitative courses. The tools and frameworks offer structure, and facilitate ensuring that changes made to any course are evaluable and generate actionable assessments for learners.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recent work demonstrated the inadequacy of Shapley values for explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). Although to disprove a theory a single counterexample suffices, a possible criticism of earlier work is that the focus was solely on Boolean classifiers. To address such possible criticism, this paper demonstrates the inadequacy of Shapley values for families of classifiers where features are not boolean, but also for families of classifiers for which multiple classes can be picked. Furthermore, the paper shows that the features changed in any minimal $l_0$ distance adversarial examples do not include irrelevant features, thus offering further arguments regarding the inadequacy of Shapley values for XAI.

**ABSTRACT**  
Large Language Models (LLMs) are evolving at an unprecedented pace and have exhibited considerable capability in the realm of natural language processing (NLP) with world knowledge. Benefiting from ultra-large-scale training corpora, a single LLM can manage typical NLP tasks competently. However, its performance in executing reasoning tasks is still confined by the limitations of its internal representations. To push this boundary further, we introduce Corex in this paper, a suite of novel general-purpose strategies that transform LLMs into autonomous agents pioneering multi-model collaborations for complex task-solving. Inspired by human behaviors, Corex is constituted by diverse collaboration paradigms including Debate, Review, and Retrieve modes, which collectively work towards enhancing the factuality, faithfulness, and reliability of the reasoning process. These paradigms foster task-agnostic approaches that enable LLMs to ''think outside the box,'' thereby overcoming hallucinations and providing better solutions. Through extensive experiments across four different types of reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that orchestrating multiple LLMs to work in concert yields substantially better performance compared to existing methods. Further results and in-depth analysis demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our method, facilitating collaboration among different LLMs and promoting annotation efficiency.

**ABSTRACT**  
Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive performance on a wide variety of tasks, but they often struggle with tasks that require multi-step reasoning or goal-directed planning. To address this, we take inspiration from the human brain, in which planning is accomplished via the recurrent interaction of specialized modules in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). These modules perform functions such as conflict monitoring, state prediction, state evaluation, task decomposition, and task coordination. We find that LLMs are sometimes capable of carrying out these functions in isolation, but struggle to autonomously coordinate them in the service of a goal. Therefore, we propose a black box architecture with multiple LLM-based (GPT-4) modules. The architecture improves planning through the interaction of specialized PFC-inspired modules that break down a larger problem into multiple brief automated calls to the LLM. We evaluate the combined architecture on two challenging planning tasks -- graph traversal and Tower of Hanoi -- finding that it yields significant improvements over standard LLM methods (e.g., zero-shot prompting or in-context learning). These results demonstrate the benefit of utilizing knowledge from cognitive neuroscience to improve planning in LLMs.

**ABSTRACT**  
Given a vector dataset $\mathcal{X}$ and a query vector $\vec{x}_q$, graph-based Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) aims to build a graph index $G$ and approximately return vectors with minimum distances to $\vec{x}_q$ by searching over $G$. The main drawback of graph-based ANNS is that a graph index would be too large to fit into the memory especially for a large-scale $\mathcal{X}$. To solve this, a Product Quantization (PQ)-based hybrid method called DiskANN is proposed to store a low-dimensional PQ index in memory and retain a graph index in SSD, thus reducing memory overhead while ensuring a high search accuracy. However, it suffers from two I/O issues that significantly affect the overall efficiency: (1) long routing path from an entry vertex to the query's neighborhood that results in large number of I/O requests and (2) redundant I/O requests during the routing process. We propose an optimized DiskANN++ to overcome above issues. Specifically, for the first issue, we present a query-sensitive entry vertex selection strategy to replace DiskANN's static graph-central entry vertex by a dynamically determined entry vertex that is close to the query. For the second I/O issue, we present an isomorphic mapping on DiskANN's graph index to optimize the SSD layout and propose an asynchronously optimized Pagesearch based on the optimized SSD layout as an alternative to DiskANN's beamsearch. Comprehensive experimental studies on eight real-world datasets demonstrate our DiskANN++'s superiority on efficiency. We achieve a notable 1.5 X to 2.2 X improvement on QPS compared to DiskANN, given the same accuracy constraint.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this article, the performance of a fixed grid network is examined for various modulation formats to estimate the system's capacity and spectral efficiency. The optical In-phase Quadrature Modulator structure is used to build a fixed grid network modulation, and the homodyne detection approach is used for the receiver. Data multiplexing is accomplished using the Polarization Division Multiplexed technology. 100 Gbps, 150 Gbps, and 200 Gbps data rates are transmitted under these circumstances utilizing various modulation formats. Various pre-processing and signal recovery steps are explained by using modern digital signal processing systems. The achieved spectrum efficiencies for PM-QPSK, PM-8 QAM, and PM-16 QAM, respectively, were 2, 3, and 4 bits/s/Hz. Different modulation like PM-QPSK, PM-8-QAM, and PM-16-QAM each has system capacities of 8-9, 12-13.5, and 16-18 Tbps and it reaches transmission distances of 3000, 1300, and 700 kilometers with acceptable Bit Error Rate less than equal to 2*10-3 respectively. Peak optical power for received signal detection and full width at half maximum is noted for the different modulations under a fixed grind network.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper examines the problem of information routing in a large-scale communication network, which can be formulated as a constrained statistical learning problem having access to only local information. We delineate a novel State Augmentation (SA) strategy to maximize the aggregate information at source nodes using graph neural network (GNN) architectures, by deploying graph convolutions over the topological links of the communication network. The proposed technique leverages only the local information available at each node and efficiently routes desired information to the destination nodes. We leverage an unsupervised learning procedure to convert the output of the GNN architecture to optimal information routing strategies. In the experiments, we perform the evaluation on real-time network topologies to validate our algorithms. Numerical simulations depict the improved performance of the proposed method in training a GNN parameterization as compared to baseline algorithms.

**ABSTRACT**  
As artificial intelligence (AI) models are scaled up, new capabilities can emerge unintentionally and unpredictably, some of which might be dangerous. In response, dangerous capabilities evaluations have emerged as a new risk assessment tool. But what should frontier AI developers do if sufficiently dangerous capabilities are in fact discovered? This paper focuses on one possible response: coordinated pausing. It proposes an evaluation-based coordination scheme that consists of five main steps: (1) Frontier AI models are evaluated for dangerous capabilities. (2) Whenever, and each time, a model fails a set of evaluations, the developer pauses certain research and development activities. (3) Other developers are notified whenever a model with dangerous capabilities has been discovered. They also pause related research and development activities. (4) The discovered capabilities are analyzed and adequate safety precautions are put in place. (5) Developers only resume their paused activities if certain safety thresholds are reached. The paper also discusses four concrete versions of that scheme. In the first version, pausing is completely voluntary and relies on public pressure on developers. In the second version, participating developers collectively agree to pause under certain conditions. In the third version, a single auditor evaluates models of multiple developers who agree to pause if any model fails a set of evaluations. In the fourth version, developers are legally required to run evaluations and pause if dangerous capabilities are discovered. Finally, the paper discusses the desirability and feasibility of our proposed coordination scheme. It concludes that coordinated pausing is a promising mechanism for tackling emerging risks from frontier AI models. However, a number of practical and legal obstacles need to be overcome, especially how to avoid violations of antitrust law.

**ABSTRACT**  
A comprehensive approach to addressing catastrophic risks from AI models should cover the full model lifecycle. This paper explores contingency plans for cases where pre-deployment risk management falls short: where either very dangerous models are deployed, or deployed models become very dangerous.   Informed by incident response practices from industries including cybersecurity, we describe a toolkit of deployment corrections that AI developers can use to respond to dangerous capabilities, behaviors, or use cases of AI models that develop or are detected after deployment. We also provide a framework for AI developers to prepare and implement this toolkit.   We conclude by recommending that frontier AI developers should (1) maintain control over model access, (2) establish or grow dedicated teams to design and maintain processes for deployment corrections, including incident response plans, and (3) establish these deployment corrections as allowable actions with downstream users. We also recommend frontier AI developers, standard-setting organizations, and regulators should collaborate to define a standardized industry-wide approach to the use of deployment corrections in incident response.   Caveat: This work applies to frontier AI models that are made available through interfaces (e.g., API) that provide the AI developer or another upstream party means of maintaining control over access (e.g., GPT-4 or Claude). It does not apply to management of catastrophic risk from open-source models (e.g., BLOOM or Llama-2), for which the restrictions we discuss are largely unenforceable.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this paper, we consider the maximization of the secrecy rate in multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) network. A joint beamforming, rate allocation, and UAV trajectory optimization problem is formulated which is nonconvex. Hence, the problem is transformed into a Markov decision problem and a novel multiagent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework is designed. The proposed framework (named DUN-DRL) combines deep unfolding to design beamforming and rate allocation, data-driven to design the UAV trajectory, and deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) for the learning procedure. The proposed DUN-DRL have shown great performance and outperformed other DRL-based methods in the literature.

**ABSTRACT**  
Digital image forensics plays a crucial role in image authentication and manipulation localization. Despite the progress powered by deep neural networks, existing forgery localization methodologies exhibit limitations when deployed to unseen datasets and perturbed images (i.e., lack of generalization and robustness to real-world applications). To circumvent these problems and aid image integrity, this paper presents a generalized and robust manipulation localization model through the analysis of pixel inconsistency artifacts. The rationale is grounded on the observation that most image signal processors (ISP) involve the demosaicing process, which introduces pixel correlations in pristine images. Moreover, manipulating operations, including splicing, copy-move, and inpainting, directly affect such pixel regularity. We, therefore, first split the input image into several blocks and design masked self-attention mechanisms to model the global pixel dependency in input images. Simultaneously, we optimize another local pixel dependency stream to mine local manipulation clues within input forgery images. In addition, we design novel Learning-to-Weight Modules (LWM) to combine features from the two streams, thereby enhancing the final forgery localization performance. To improve the training process, we propose a novel Pixel-Inconsistency Data Augmentation (PIDA) strategy, driving the model to focus on capturing inherent pixel-level artifacts instead of mining semantic forgery traces. This work establishes a comprehensive benchmark integrating 15 representative detection models across 12 datasets. Extensive experiments show that our method successfully extracts inherent pixel-inconsistency forgery fingerprints and achieve state-of-the-art generalization and robustness performances in image manipulation localization.

**ABSTRACT**  
In recent years, hardware-accelerated neural networks have gained significant attention for edge computing applications. Among various hardware options, crossbar arrays, offer a promising avenue for efficient storage and manipulation of neural network weights. However, the transition from trained floating-point models to hardware-constrained analog architectures remains a challenge. In this work, we combine a quantization technique specifically designed for such architectures with a novel self-correcting mechanism. By utilizing dual crossbar connections to represent both the positive and negative parts of a single weight, we develop an algorithm to approximate a set of multiplicative weights. These weights, along with their differences, aim to represent the original network's weights with minimal loss in performance. We implement the models using IBM's aihwkit and evaluate their efficacy over time. Our results demonstrate that, when paired with an on-chip pulse generator, our self-correcting neural network performs comparably to those trained with analog-aware algorithms.

**ABSTRACT**  
High-level synthesis (HLS) enhances digital hardware design productivity through a high abstraction level. Even if the HLS abstraction prevents fine-grained manual register-transfer level (RTL) optimizations, it also enables automatable optimizations that would be unfeasible or hard to automate at RTL. Specifically, we propose a task-level multi-pumping methodology to reduce resource utilization, particularly digital signal processors (DSPs), while preserving the throughput of HLS kernels modeled as dataflow graphs (DFGs) targeting field-programmable gate arrays. The methodology exploits the HLS resource sharing to automatically insert the logic for reusing the same functional unit for different operations. In addition, it relies on multi-clock DFG s to run the multi-pumped tasks at higher frequencies. The methodology scales the pipeline initiation interval (II) and the clock frequency constraints of resource-intensive tasks by a multi-pumping factor (M). The looser II allows sharing the same resource among M different operations, while the tighter clock frequency preserves the throughput. We verified that our methodology opens a new Pareto front in the throughput and resource space by applying it to open-source HLS designs using state-of-the-art commercial HLS and implementation tools by Xilinx. The multi-pumped designs require up to 40% fewer DSP resources at the same throughput as the original designs optimized for performance (i.e., running at the maximum clock frequency) and achieve up to 50% better throughput using the same DSP s as the original designs optimized for resources with a single clock.

**ABSTRACT**  
Speech emotion recognition (SER) has drawn increasing attention for its applications in human-machine interaction. However, existing SER methods ignore the information gap between the pre-training speech recognition task and the downstream SER task, leading to sub-optimal performance. Moreover, they require much time to fine-tune on each specific speech dataset, restricting their effectiveness in real-world scenes with large-scale noisy data. To address these issues, we propose an active learning (AL) based Fine-Tuning framework for SER that leverages task adaptation pre-training (TAPT) and AL methods to enhance performance and efficiency. Specifically, we first use TAPT to minimize the information gap between the pre-training and the downstream task. Then, AL methods are used to iteratively select a subset of the most informative and diverse samples for fine-tuning, reducing time consumption. Experiments demonstrate that using only 20\%pt. samples improves 8.45\%pt. accuracy and reduces 79\%pt. time consumption.
