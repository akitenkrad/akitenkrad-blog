**ABSTRACT**  
AI for Science (AI4Science), particularly in the form of self-driving labs, has the potential to sideline human involvement and hinder scientific discovery within the broader community. While prior research has focused on ensuring the responsible deployment of AI applications, enhancing security, and ensuring interpretability, we also propose that promoting openness in AI4Science discoveries should be carefully considered. In this paper, we introduce the concept of AI for Open Science (AI4OS) as a multi-agent extension of AI4Science with the core principle of maximizing open knowledge translation throughout the scientific enterprise rather than a single organizational unit. We use the established principles of Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD) to formalize a language around AI4OS. We then discuss three principle stages of knowledge translation embedded in AI4Science systems and detail specific points where openness can be applied to yield an AI4OS alternative. Lastly, we formulate a theoretical metric to assess AI4OS with a supporting ethical argument highlighting its importance. Our goal is that by drawing attention to AI4OS we can ensure the natural consequence of AI4Science (e.g., self-driving labs) is a benefit not only for its developers but for society as a whole.

**ABSTRACT**  
Several recent works have studied the societal effects of AI; these include issues such as fairness, robustness, and safety. In many of these objectives, a learner seeks to minimize its worst-case loss over a set of predefined distributions (known as uncertainty sets), with usual examples being perturbed versions of the empirical distribution. In other words, aforementioned problems can be written as min-max problems over these uncertainty sets. In this work, we provide a general framework for studying these problems, which we refer to as Responsible AI (RAI) games. We provide two classes of algorithms for solving these games: (a) game-play based algorithms, and (b) greedy stagewise estimation algorithms. The former class is motivated by online learning and game theory, whereas the latter class is motivated by the classical statistical literature on boosting, and regression. We empirically demonstrate the applicability and competitive performance of our techniques for solving several RAI problems, particularly around subpopulation shift.

**ABSTRACT**  
During the last decades, a myriad of fuzzy time series models have been proposed in scientific literature. Among the most accurate models found in fuzzy time series, the high-order ones are the most accurate. The research described in this paper tackles three potential limitations associated with the application of high-order fuzzy time series models. To begin with, the adequacy of forecast rules lacks consistency. Secondly, as the model's order increases, data utilization diminishes. Thirdly, the uniformity of forecast rules proves to be highly contingent on the chosen interval partitions. To address these likely drawbacks, we introduce a novel model based on fuzzy time series that amalgamates the principles of particle swarm optimization (PSO) and weighted summation. Our results show that our approach models accurately the time series in comparison with previous methods.

**ABSTRACT**  
The difficulty of identifying the physical model of complex systems has led to exploring methods that do not rely on such complex modeling of the systems. Deep reinforcement learning has been the pioneer for solving this problem without the need for relying on the physical model of complex systems by just interacting with it. However, it uses a black-box learning approach that makes it difficult to be applied within real-world and safety-critical systems without providing explanations of the actions derived by the model. Furthermore, an open research question in deep reinforcement learning is how to focus the policy learning of critical decisions within a sparse domain. This paper proposes a novel approach for the use of deep reinforcement learning in safety-critical systems. It combines the advantages of probabilistic modeling and reinforcement learning with the added benefits of interpretability and works in collaboration and synchronization with conventional decision-making strategies. The BC-SRLA is activated in specific situations which are identified autonomously through the fused information of probabilistic model and reinforcement learning, such as abnormal conditions or when the system is near-to-failure. Further, it is initialized with a baseline policy using policy cloning to allow minimum interactions with the environment to address the challenges associated with using RL in safety-critical industries. The effectiveness of the BC-SRLA is demonstrated through a case study in maintenance applied to turbofan engines, where it shows superior performance to the prior art and other baselines.

**ABSTRACT**  
A key aspect of human intelligence is the ability to imagine -- composing learned concepts in novel ways -- to make sense of new scenarios. Such capacity is not yet attained for machine learning systems. In this work, in the context of visual reasoning, we show how modularity can be leveraged to derive a compositional data augmentation framework inspired by imagination. Our method, denoted Object-centric Compositional Neural Module Network (OC-NMN), decomposes visual generative reasoning tasks into a series of primitives applied to objects without using a domain-specific language. We show that our modular architectural choices can be used to generate new training tasks that lead to better out-of-distribution generalization. We compare our model to existing and new baselines in proposed visual reasoning benchmark that consists of applying arithmetic operations to MNIST digits.

**ABSTRACT**  
Previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) method achieved a remarkable execution accuracy on the Spider dataset, which is one of the largest and most diverse datasets in the Text-to-SQL domain. However, during our reproduce of the business dataset, we observed a significant drop in performance. We examined the differences in dataset complexity, as well as the clarity of questions' intentions, and assessed how those differences could impact the performance of prompting methods. Subsequently, We develop a more adaptable and more general prompting method, involving mainly query rewriting and SQL boosting, which respectively transform vague information into exact and precise information and enhance the SQL itself by incorporating execution feedback and the query results from the database content. In order to prevent information gaps, we include the comments, value types, and value samples for columns as part of the database description in the prompt. Our experiments with Large Language Models (LLMs) illustrate the significant performance improvement on the business dataset and prove the substantial potential of our method. In terms of execution accuracy on the business dataset, the SOTA method scored 21.05, while our approach scored 65.79. As a result, our approach achieved a notable performance improvement even when using a less capable pre-trained language model. Last but not the least, we also explore the Text-to-Python and Text-to-Function options, and we deeply analyze the pros and cons among them, offering valuable insights to the community.

**ABSTRACT**  
Thematic analysis and other variants of inductive coding are widely used qualitative analytic methods within empirical legal studies (ELS). We propose a novel framework facilitating effective collaboration of a legal expert with a large language model (LLM) for generating initial codes (phase 2 of thematic analysis), searching for themes (phase 3), and classifying the data in terms of the themes (to kick-start phase 4). We employed the framework for an analysis of a dataset (n=785) of facts descriptions from criminal court opinions regarding thefts. The goal of the analysis was to discover classes of typical thefts. Our results show that the LLM, namely OpenAI's GPT-4, generated reasonable initial codes, and it was capable of improving the quality of the codes based on expert feedback. They also suggest that the model performed well in zero-shot classification of facts descriptions in terms of the themes. Finally, the themes autonomously discovered by the LLM appear to map fairly well to the themes arrived at by legal experts. These findings can be leveraged by legal researchers to guide their decisions in integrating LLMs into their thematic analyses, as well as other inductive coding projects.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recent advances in LLMs have revolutionized the landscape of reasoning tasks. To enhance the capabilities of LLMs to emulate human reasoning, prior works focus on modeling reasoning steps using specific thought structures like chains, trees, or graphs. However, LLM-based reasoning continues to encounter three challenges: 1) Selecting appropriate reasoning structures for various tasks; 2) Exploiting known conditions sufficiently and efficiently to deduce new insights; 3) Considering the impact of historical reasoning experience. To address these challenges, we propose DetermLR, a novel reasoning framework that formulates the reasoning process as a transformational journey from indeterminate premises to determinate ones. This process is marked by the incremental accumulation of determinate premises, making the conclusion progressively closer to clarity. DetermLR includes three essential components: 1) Premise identification: We categorize premises into two distinct types: determinate and indeterminate. This empowers LLMs to customize reasoning structures to match the specific task complexities. 2) Premise prioritization and exploration: We leverage quantitative measurements to assess the relevance of each premise to the target, prioritizing more relevant premises for exploring new insights. 3) Iterative process with reasoning memory: We introduce a reasoning memory module to automate storage and extraction of available premises and reasoning paths, preserving historical reasoning details for more accurate premise prioritization. Comprehensive experimental results show that DetermLR outperforms all baselines on four challenging logical reasoning tasks: LogiQA, ProofWriter, FOLIO, and LogicalDeduction. DetermLR can achieve better reasoning performance while requiring fewer visited states, highlighting its superior efficiency and effectiveness in tackling logical reasoning tasks.

**ABSTRACT**  
Data augmentation has become a standard component of vision pre-trained models to capture the invariance between augmented views. In practice, augmentation techniques that mask regions of a sample with zero/mean values or patches from other samples are commonly employed in pre-trained models with self-/semi-/fully-supervised contrastive losses. However, the underlying mechanism behind the effectiveness of these augmentation techniques remains poorly explored. To investigate the problems, we conduct an empirical study to quantify how data augmentation affects performance. Concretely, we apply 4 types of data augmentations termed with Random Erasing, CutOut, CutMix and MixUp to a series of self-/semi-/fully- supervised pre-trained models. We report their performance on vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation. We then explicitly evaluate the invariance and diversity of the feature embedding. We observe that: 1) Masking regions of the images decreases the invariance of the learned feature embedding while providing a more considerable diversity. 2) Manual annotations do not change the invariance or diversity of the learned feature embedding. 3) The MixUp approach improves the diversity significantly, with only a marginal decrease in terms of the invariance.

**ABSTRACT**  
Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have revolutionized signal representation by leveraging neural networks to provide continuous and smooth representations of complex data. However, existing INRs face limitations in capturing fine-grained details, handling noise, and adapting to diverse signal types. To address these challenges, we introduce INCODE, a novel approach that enhances the control of the sinusoidal-based activation function in INRs using deep prior knowledge. INCODE comprises a harmonizer network and a composer network, where the harmonizer network dynamically adjusts key parameters of the activation function. Through a task-specific pre-trained model, INCODE adapts the task-specific parameters to optimize the representation process. Our approach not only excels in representation, but also extends its prowess to tackle complex tasks such as audio, image, and 3D shape reconstructions, as well as intricate challenges such as neural radiance fields (NeRFs), and inverse problems, including denoising, super-resolution, inpainting, and CT reconstruction. Through comprehensive experiments, INCODE demonstrates its superiority in terms of robustness, accuracy, quality, and convergence rate, broadening the scope of signal representation. Please visit the project's website for details on the proposed method and access to the code.

**ABSTRACT**  
Previous research in $2D$ object detection focuses on various tasks, including detecting objects in generic and camouflaged images. These works are regarded as passive works for object detection as they take the input image as is. However, convergence to global minima is not guaranteed to be optimal in neural networks; therefore, we argue that the trained weights in the object detector are not optimal. To rectify this problem, we propose a wrapper based on proactive schemes, PrObeD, which enhances the performance of these object detectors by learning a signal. PrObeD consists of an encoder-decoder architecture, where the encoder network generates an image-dependent signal termed templates to encrypt the input images, and the decoder recovers this template from the encrypted images. We propose that learning the optimum template results in an object detector with an improved detection performance. The template acts as a mask to the input images to highlight semantics useful for the object detector. Finetuning the object detector with these encrypted images enhances the detection performance for both generic and camouflaged. Our experiments on MS-COCO, CAMO, COD$10$K, and NC$4$K datasets show improvement over different detectors after applying PrObeD.

**ABSTRACT**  
Spatiotemporal predictive learning offers a self-supervised learning paradigm that enables models to learn both spatial and temporal patterns by predicting future sequences based on historical sequences. Mainstream methods are dominated by recurrent units, yet they are limited by their lack of parallelization and often underperform in real-world scenarios. To improve prediction quality while maintaining computational efficiency, we propose an innovative triplet attention transformer designed to capture both inter-frame dynamics and intra-frame static features. Specifically, the model incorporates the Triplet Attention Module (TAM), which replaces traditional recurrent units by exploring self-attention mechanisms in temporal, spatial, and channel dimensions. In this configuration: (i) temporal tokens contain abstract representations of inter-frame, facilitating the capture of inherent temporal dependencies; (ii) spatial and channel attention combine to refine the intra-frame representation by performing fine-grained interactions across spatial and channel dimensions. Alternating temporal, spatial, and channel-level attention allows our approach to learn more complex short- and long-range spatiotemporal dependencies. Extensive experiments demonstrate performance surpassing existing recurrent-based and recurrent-free methods, achieving state-of-the-art under multi-scenario examination including moving object trajectory prediction, traffic flow prediction, driving scene prediction, and human motion capture.

**ABSTRACT**  
Efficient object detection methods have recently received great attention in remote sensing. Although deep convolutional networks often have excellent detection accuracy, their deployment on resource-limited edge devices is difficult. Knowledge distillation (KD) is a strategy for addressing this issue since it makes models lightweight while maintaining accuracy. However, existing KD methods for object detection have encountered two constraints. First, they discard potentially important background information and only distill nearby foreground regions. Second, they only rely on the global context, which limits the student detector's ability to acquire local information from the teacher detector. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose Attention-based Feature Distillation (AFD), a new KD approach that distills both local and global information from the teacher detector. To enhance local distillation, we introduce a multi-instance attention mechanism that effectively distinguishes between background and foreground elements. This approach prompts the student detector to focus on the pertinent channels and pixels, as identified by the teacher detector. Local distillation lacks global information, thus attention global distillation is proposed to reconstruct the relationship between various pixels and pass it from teacher to student detector. The performance of AFD is evaluated on two public aerial image benchmarks, and the evaluation results demonstrate that AFD in object detection can attain the performance of other state-of-the-art models while being efficient.

**ABSTRACT**  
Significant progress in the development of highly adaptable and reusable Artificial Intelligence (AI) models is expected to have a significant impact on Earth science and remote sensing. Foundation models are pre-trained on large unlabeled datasets through self-supervision, and then fine-tuned for various downstream tasks with small labeled datasets. This paper introduces a first-of-a-kind framework for the efficient pre-training and fine-tuning of foundational models on extensive geospatial data. We have utilized this framework to create Prithvi, a transformer-based geospatial foundational model pre-trained on more than 1TB of multispectral satellite imagery from the Harmonized Landsat-Sentinel 2 (HLS) dataset. Our study demonstrates the efficacy of our framework in successfully fine-tuning Prithvi to a range of Earth observation tasks that have not been tackled by previous work on foundation models involving multi-temporal cloud gap imputation, flood mapping, wildfire scar segmentation, and multi-temporal crop segmentation. Our experiments show that the pre-trained model accelerates the fine-tuning process compared to leveraging randomly initialized weights. In addition, pre-trained Prithvi compares well against the state-of-the-art, e.g., outperforming a conditional GAN model in multi-temporal cloud imputation by up to 5pp (or 5.7%) in the structural similarity index. Finally, due to the limited availability of labeled data in the field of Earth observation, we gradually reduce the quantity of available labeled data for refining the model to evaluate data efficiency and demonstrate that data can be decreased significantly without affecting the model's accuracy. The pre-trained 100 million parameter model and corresponding fine-tuning workflows have been released publicly as open source contributions to the global Earth sciences community through Hugging Face.

**ABSTRACT**  
Self-supervised representation learning methods mainly focus on image-level instance discrimination. This study explores the potential benefits of incorporating patch-level discrimination into existing methods to enhance the quality of learned representations by simultaneously looking at local and global visual features. Towards this idea, we present a straightforward yet effective patch-matching algorithm that can find the corresponding patches across the augmented views of an image. The augmented views are subsequently fed into a self-supervised learning framework employing Vision Transformer (ViT) as its backbone. The result is the generation of both image-level and patch-level representations. Leveraging the proposed patch-matching algorithm, the model minimizes the representation distance between not only the CLS tokens but also the corresponding patches. As a result, the model gains a more comprehensive understanding of both the entirety of the image as well as its finer details. We pretrain the proposed method on small, medium, and large-scale datasets. It is shown that our approach could outperform state-of-the-art image-level representation learning methods on both image classification and downstream tasks.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recent advances in Vision Transformers (ViT) and Stable Diffusion (SD) models with their ability to capture rich semantic features of the image have been used for image correspondence tasks on natural images. In this paper, we examine the ability of a variety of pre-trained ViT (DINO, DINOv2, SAM, CLIP) and SD models, trained exclusively on natural images, for solving the correspondence problems on medical images. While many works have made a case for in-domain training, we show that the models trained on natural images can offer good performance on medical images across different modalities (CT,MR,Ultrasound) sourced from various manufacturers, over multiple anatomical regions (brain, thorax, abdomen, extremities), and on wide variety of tasks. Further, we leverage the correspondence with respect to a template image to prompt a Segment Anything (SAM) model to arrive at single shot segmentation, achieving dice range of 62%-90% across tasks, using just one image as reference. We also show that our single-shot method outperforms the recently proposed few-shot segmentation method - UniverSeg (Dice range 47%-80%) on most of the semantic segmentation tasks(six out of seven) across medical imaging modalities.

**ABSTRACT**  
The teacher-student framework, prevalent in semi-supervised semantic segmentation, mainly employs the exponential moving average (EMA) to update a single teacher's weights based on the student's. However, EMA updates raise a problem in that the weights of the teacher and student are getting coupled, causing a potential performance bottleneck. Furthermore, this problem may become more severe when training with more complicated labels such as segmentation masks but with few annotated data. This paper introduces Dual Teacher, a simple yet effective approach that employs dual temporary teachers aiming to alleviate the coupling problem for the student. The temporary teachers work in shifts and are progressively improved, so consistently prevent the teacher and student from becoming excessively close. Specifically, the temporary teachers periodically take turns generating pseudo-labels to train a student model and maintain the distinct characteristics of the student model for each epoch. Consequently, Dual Teacher achieves competitive performance on the PASCAL VOC, Cityscapes, and ADE20K benchmarks with remarkably shorter training times than state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, we demonstrate that our approach is model-agnostic and compatible with both CNN- and Transformer-based models. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/naver-ai/dual-teacher}.

**ABSTRACT**  
The dilemma between plasticity and stability presents a significant challenge in Incremental Learning (IL), especially in the exemplar-free scenario where accessing old-task samples is strictly prohibited during the learning of a new task. A straightforward solution to this issue is learning and storing an independent model for each task, known as Single Task Learning (STL). Despite the linear growth in model storage with the number of tasks in STL, we empirically discover that averaging these model parameters can potentially preserve knowledge across all tasks. Inspired by this observation, we propose a Dual-Learner framework with Cumulative Parameter Averaging (DLCPA). DLCPA employs a dual-learner design: a plastic learner focused on acquiring new-task knowledge and a stable learner responsible for accumulating all learned knowledge. The knowledge from the plastic learner is transferred to the stable learner via cumulative parameter averaging. Additionally, several task-specific classifiers work in cooperation with the stable learner to yield the final prediction. Specifically, when learning a new task, these modules are updated in a cyclic manner: i) the plastic learner is initially optimized using a self-supervised loss besides the supervised loss to enhance the feature extraction robustness; ii) the stable learner is then updated with respect to the plastic learner in a cumulative parameter averaging manner to maintain its task-wise generalization; iii) the task-specific classifier is accordingly optimized to align with the stable learner. Experimental results on CIFAR-100 and Tiny-ImageNet show that DLCPA outperforms several state-of-the-art exemplar-free baselines in both Task-IL and Class-IL settings.

**ABSTRACT**  
We present a novel framework for generating adversarial benchmarks to evaluate the robustness of image classification models. Our framework allows users to customize the types of distortions to be optimally applied to images, which helps address the specific distortions relevant to their deployment. The benchmark can generate datasets at various distortion levels to assess the robustness of different image classifiers. Our results show that the adversarial samples generated by our framework with any of the image classification models, like ResNet-50, Inception-V3, and VGG-16, are effective and transferable to other models causing them to fail. These failures happen even when these models are adversarially retrained using state-of-the-art techniques, demonstrating the generalizability of our adversarial samples. We achieve competitive performance in terms of net $L_2$ distortion compared to state-of-the-art benchmark techniques on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet; however, we demonstrate our framework achieves such results with simple distortions like Gaussian noise without introducing unnatural artifacts or color bleeds. This is made possible by a model-based reinforcement learning (RL) agent and a technique that reduces a deep tree search of the image for model sensitivity to perturbations, to a one-level analysis and action. The flexibility of choosing distortions and setting classification probability thresholds for multiple classes makes our framework suitable for algorithmic audits.

**ABSTRACT**  
Monocular 3D object detection (M3OD) is a significant yet inherently challenging task in autonomous driving due to absence of implicit depth cues in a single RGB image. In this paper, we strive to boost currently underperforming monocular 3D object detectors by leveraging an abundance of unlabelled data via semi-supervised learning. Our proposed ODM3D framework entails cross-modal knowledge distillation at various levels to inject LiDAR-domain knowledge into a monocular detector during training. By identifying foreground sparsity as the main culprit behind existing methods' suboptimal training, we exploit the precise localisation information embedded in LiDAR points to enable more foreground-attentive and efficient distillation via the proposed BEV occupancy guidance mask, leading to notably improved knowledge transfer and M3OD performance. Besides, motivated by insights into why existing cross-modal GT-sampling techniques fail on our task at hand, we further design a novel cross-modal object-wise data augmentation strategy for effective RGB-LiDAR joint learning. Our method ranks 1st in both KITTI validation and test benchmarks, significantly surpassing all existing monocular methods, supervised or semi-supervised, on both BEV and 3D detection metrics.

**ABSTRACT**  
The clinical diagnosis of skin lesion involves the analysis of dermoscopic and clinical modalities. Dermoscopic images provide a detailed view of the surface structures whereas clinical images offer a complementary macroscopic information. The visual diagnosis of melanoma is also based on seven-point checklist which involves identifying different visual attributes. Recently, supervised learning approaches such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown great performances using both dermoscopic and clinical modalities (Multi-modality). The seven different visual attributes in the checklist are also used to further improve the the diagnosis. The performances of these approaches, however, are still reliant on the availability of large-scaled labeled data. The acquisition of annotated dataset is an expensive and time-consuming task, more so with annotating multi-attributes. To overcome this limitation, we propose a self-supervised learning (SSL) algorithm for multi-modality skin lesion classification. Our algorithm enables the multi-modality learning by maximizing the similarities between paired dermoscopic and clinical images from different views. In addition, we generate surrogate pseudo-multi-labels that represent seven attributes via clustering analysis. We also propose a label-relation-aware module to refine each pseudo-label embedding and capture the interrelationships between pseudo-multi-labels. We validated the effectiveness of our algorithm using well-benchmarked seven-point skin lesion dataset. Our results show that our algorithm achieved better performances than other state-of-the-art SSL counterparts.

**ABSTRACT**  
Due to the powerful ability in capturing the global information, Transformer has become an alternative architecture of CNNs for hyperspectral image classification. However, general Transformer mainly considers the global spectral information while ignores the multiscale spatial information of the hyperspectral image. In this paper, we propose a multiscale spectral-spatial convolutional Transformer (MultiscaleFormer) for hyperspectral image classification. First, the developed method utilizes multiscale spatial patches as tokens to formulate the spatial Transformer and generates multiscale spatial representation of each band in each pixel. Second, the spatial representation of all the bands in a given pixel are utilized as tokens to formulate the spectral Transformer and generate the multiscale spectral-spatial representation of each pixel. Besides, a modified spectral-spatial CAF module is constructed in the MultiFormer to fuse cross-layer spectral and spatial information. Therefore, the proposed MultiFormer can capture the multiscale spectral-spatial information and provide better performance than most of other architectures for hyperspectral image classification. Experiments are conducted over commonly used real-world datasets and the comparison results show the superiority of the proposed method.

**ABSTRACT**  
Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been demonstrated their powerful ability to extract discriminative features for hyperspectral image classification. However, general deep learning methods for CNNs ignore the influence of complex environmental factor which enlarges the intra-class variance and decreases the inter-class variance. This multiplies the difficulty to extract discriminative features. To overcome this problem, this work develops a novel deep intrinsic decomposition with adversarial learning, namely AdverDecom, for hyperspectral image classification to mitigate the negative impact of environmental factors on classification performance. First, we develop a generative network for hyperspectral image (HyperNet) to extract the environmental-related feature and category-related feature from the image. Then, a discriminative network is constructed to distinguish different environmental categories. Finally, a environmental and category joint learning loss is developed for adversarial learning to make the deep model learn discriminative features. Experiments are conducted over three commonly used real-world datasets and the comparison results show the superiority of the proposed method. The implementation of the proposed method and other compared methods could be accessed at https://github.com/shendu-sw/Adversarial Learning Intrinsic Decomposition for the sake of reproducibility.

**ABSTRACT**  
Currently, there are computer vision systems that help us with tasks that would be dull for humans, such as surveillance and vehicle tracking. An important part of this analysis is to identify traffic anomalies. An anomaly tells us that something unusual has happened, in this case on the highway. This paper aims to model vehicle tracking using computer vision to detect traffic anomalies on a highway. We develop the steps of detection, tracking, and analysis of traffic: the detection of vehicles from video of urban traffic, the tracking of vehicles using a bipartite graph and the Convex Hull algorithm to delimit moving areas. Finally for anomaly detection we use two data structures to detect the beginning and end of the anomaly. The first is the QuadTree that groups vehicles that are stopped for a long time on the road and the second that approaches vehicles that are occluded. Experimental results show that our method is acceptable on the Track4 test set, with an F1 score of 85.7% and a mean squared error of 25.432.

**ABSTRACT**  
Sim2Real transfer has gained popularity because it helps transfer from inexpensive simulators to real world. This paper presents a novel system that fuses components in a traditional \textit{World Model} into a robust system, trained entirely within a simulator, that \textit{Zero-Shot} transfers to the real world. To facilitate transfer, we use an intermediary representation that are based on \textit{Bird's Eye View (BEV)} images. Thus, our robot learns to navigate in a simulator by first learning to translate from complex \textit{First-Person View (FPV)} based RGB images to BEV representations, then learning to navigate using those representations. Later, when tested in the real world, the robot uses the perception model that translates FPV-based RGB images to embeddings that are used by the downstream policy. The incorporation of state-checking modules using \textit{Anchor images} and \textit{Mixture Density LSTM} not only interpolates uncertain and missing observations but also enhances the robustness of the model when exposed to the real-world environment. We trained the model using data collected using a \textit{Differential drive} robot in the CARLA simulator. Our methodology's effectiveness is shown through the deployment of trained models onto a \textit{Real world Differential drive} robot. Lastly we release a comprehensive codebase, dataset and models for training and deployment that are available to the public.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this paper, we propose a fully automated method, named ACCA, to evaluate the correctness of AI-generated code for security purposes. The method uses symbolic execution to assess whether the AI-generated code behaves as a reference implementation. We use ACCA to assess four state-of-the-art models trained to generate security-oriented assembly code and compare the results of the evaluation with different baseline solutions, including output similarity metrics, widely used in the field, and the well-known ChatGPT, the AI-powered language model developed by OpenAI. Our experiments show that our method outperforms the baseline solutions and assesses the correctness of the AI-generated code similar to the human-based evaluation, which is considered the ground truth for the assessment in the field. Moreover, ACCA has a very strong correlation with human evaluation (Pearson's correlation coefficient r=0.84 on average). Finally, since it is a fully automated solution that does not require any human intervention, the proposed method performs the assessment of every code snippet in ~0.17s on average, which is definitely lower than the average time required by human analysts to manually inspect the code, based on our experience.

**ABSTRACT**  
Root Cause Analysis (RCA) is becoming increasingly crucial for ensuring the reliability of microservice systems. However, performing RCA on modern microservice systems can be challenging due to their large scale, as they usually comprise hundreds of components, leading significant human effort. This paper proposes TraceDiag, an end-to-end RCA framework that addresses the challenges for large-scale microservice systems. It leverages reinforcement learning to learn a pruning policy for the service dependency graph to automatically eliminates redundant components, thereby significantly improving the RCA efficiency. The learned pruning policy is interpretable and fully adaptive to new RCA instances. With the pruned graph, a causal-based method can be executed with high accuracy and efficiency. The proposed TraceDiag framework is evaluated on real data traces collected from the Microsoft Exchange system, and demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art RCA approaches. Notably, TraceDiag has been integrated as a critical component in the Microsoft M365 Exchange, resulting in a significant improvement in the system's reliability and a considerable reduction in the human effort required for RCA.

**ABSTRACT**  
Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) tools have become increasingly prevalent in software development, offering assistance to various managerial and technical project activities. Notable examples of these tools include OpenAIs ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and Amazon CodeWhisperer. Although many recent publications have explored and evaluated the application of GenAI, a comprehensive understanding of the current development, applications, limitations, and open challenges remains unclear to many. Particularly, we do not have an overall picture of the current state of GenAI technology in practical software engineering usage scenarios. We conducted a literature review and focus groups for a duration of five months to develop a research agenda on GenAI for Software Engineering. We identified 78 open Research Questions (RQs) in 11 areas of Software Engineering. Our results show that it is possible to explore the adoption of GenAI in partial automation and support decision-making in all software development activities. While the current literature is skewed toward software implementation, quality assurance and software maintenance, other areas, such as requirements engineering, software design, and software engineering education, would need further research attention. Common considerations when implementing GenAI include industry-level assessment, dependability and accuracy, data accessibility, transparency, and sustainability aspects associated with the technology. GenAI is bringing significant changes to the field of software engineering. Nevertheless, the state of research on the topic still remains immature. We believe that this research agenda holds significance and practical value for informing both researchers and practitioners about current applications and guiding future research.

**ABSTRACT**  
The most challenging, yet practical, setting of semi-supervised federated learning (SSFL) is where a few clients have fully labeled data whereas the other clients have fully unlabeled data. This is particularly common in healthcare settings where collaborating partners (typically hospitals) may have images but not annotations. The bottleneck in this setting is the joint training of labeled and unlabeled clients as the objective function for each client varies based on the availability of labels. This paper investigates an alternative way for effective training with labeled and unlabeled clients in a federated setting. We propose a novel learning scheme specifically designed for SSFL which we call Isolated Federated Learning (IsoFed) that circumvents the problem by avoiding simple averaging of supervised and semi-supervised models together. In particular, our training approach consists of two parts - (a) isolated aggregation of labeled and unlabeled client models, and (b) local self-supervised pretraining of isolated global models in all clients. We evaluate our model performance on medical image datasets of four different modalities publicly available within the biomedical image classification benchmark MedMNIST. We further vary the proportion of labeled clients and the degree of heterogeneity to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method under varied experimental settings.

**ABSTRACT**  
Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT are state-of-the-art text generation models that provide significant assistance in daily routines. However, LLM execution is inherently sequential, since they only produce one token at a time, thus incurring low hardware utilization on modern GPUs. Batching and speculative decoding are two techniques to improve GPU hardware utilization in LLM inference. To study their synergy, we implement a prototype implementation and perform an extensive characterization analysis on various LLM models and GPU architectures. We observe that the optimal speculation length depends on the batch size used. We analyze the key observation and build a quantitative model to explain it. Based on our analysis, we propose a new adaptive speculative decoding strategy that chooses the optimal speculation length for different batch sizes. Our evaluations show that our proposed method can achieve equal or better performance than the state-of-the-art speculation decoding schemes with fixed speculation length.

**ABSTRACT**  
For some hypothesis classes and input distributions, active agnostic learning needs exponentially fewer samples than passive learning; for other classes and distributions, it offers little to no improvement. The most popular algorithms for agnostic active learning express their performance in terms of a parameter called the disagreement coefficient, but it is known that these algorithms are inefficient on some inputs.   We take a different approach to agnostic active learning, getting an algorithm that is competitive with the optimal algorithm for any binary hypothesis class $H$ and distribution $D_X$ over $X$. In particular, if any algorithm can use $m^*$ queries to get $O(\eta)$ error, then our algorithm uses $O(m^* \log |H|)$ queries to get $O(\eta)$ error. Our algorithm lies in the vein of the splitting-based approach of Dasgupta [2004], which gets a similar result for the realizable ($\eta = 0$) setting.   We also show that it is NP-hard to do better than our algorithm's $O(\log |H|)$ overhead in general.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recent advances in attention-free sequence models rely on convolutions as alternatives to the attention operator at the core of Transformers. In particular, long convolution sequence models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many domains, but incur a significant cost during auto-regressive inference workloads -- naively requiring a full pass (or caching of activations) over the input sequence for each generated token -- similarly to attention-based models. In this paper, we seek to enable $\mathcal O(1)$ compute and memory cost per token in any pre-trained long convolution architecture to reduce memory footprint and increase throughput during generation. Concretely, our methods consist in extracting low-dimensional linear state-space models from each convolution layer, building upon rational interpolation and model-order reduction techniques. We further introduce architectural improvements to convolution-based layers such as Hyena: by weight-tying the filters across channels into heads, we achieve higher pre-training quality and reduce the number of filters to be distilled. The resulting model achieves 10x higher throughput than Transformers and 1.5x higher than Hyena at 1.3B parameters, without any loss in quality after distillation.

**ABSTRACT**  
Compositional generalization, the ability of an agent to generalize to unseen combinations of latent factors, is easy for humans but hard for deep neural networks. A line of research in cognitive science has hypothesized a process, ``iterated learning,'' to help explain how human language developed this ability; the theory rests on simultaneous pressures towards compressibility (when an ignorant agent learns from an informed one) and expressivity (when it uses the representation for downstream tasks). Inspired by this process, we propose to improve the compositional generalization of deep networks by using iterated learning on models with simplicial embeddings, which can approximately discretize representations. This approach is further motivated by an analysis of compositionality based on Kolmogorov complexity. We show that this combination of changes improves compositional generalization over other approaches, demonstrating these improvements both on vision tasks with well-understood latent factors and on real molecular graph prediction tasks where the latent structure is unknown.

**ABSTRACT**  
With the rise in interest of sparse neural networks, we study how neural network pruning with synthetic data leads to sparse networks with unique training properties. We find that distilled data, a synthetic summarization of the real data, paired with Iterative Magnitude Pruning (IMP) unveils a new class of sparse networks that are more stable to SGD noise on the real data, than either the dense model, or subnetworks found with real data in IMP. That is, synthetically chosen subnetworks often train to the same minima, or exhibit linear mode connectivity. We study this through linear interpolation, loss landscape visualizations, and measuring the diagonal of the hessian. While dataset distillation as a field is still young, we find that these properties lead to synthetic subnetworks matching the performance of traditional IMP with up to 150x less training points in settings where distilled data applies.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper introduces a new approach to address the issue of class imbalance in graph neural networks (GNNs) for learning on graph-structured data. Our approach integrates imbalanced node classification and Bias-Variance Decomposition, establishing a theoretical framework that closely relates data imbalance to model variance. We also leverage graph augmentation technique to estimate the variance, and design a regularization term to alleviate the impact of imbalance. Exhaustive tests are conducted on multiple benchmarks, including naturally imbalanced datasets and public-split class-imbalanced datasets, demonstrating that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in various imbalanced scenarios. This work provides a novel theoretical perspective for addressing the problem of imbalanced node classification in GNNs.

Adversarial attacks can mislead neural network classifiers. The defense against adversarial attacks is important for AI safety. Adversarial purification is a family of approaches that defend adversarial attacks with suitable pre-processing. Diffusion models have been shown to be effective for adversarial purification. Despite their success, many aspects of diffusion purification still remain unexplored. In this paper, we investigate and improve upon three limiting designs of diffusion purification: the use of an improved diffusion model, advanced numerical simulation techniques, and optimal control of randomness. Based on our findings, we propose Purify++, a new diffusion purification algorithm that is now the state-of-the-art purification method against several adversarial attacks. Our work presents a systematic exploration of the limits of diffusion purification methods.

**ABSTRACT**  
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved great success in representing data with dependencies by recursively propagating and aggregating messages along the edges. However, edges in real-world graphs often have varying degrees of difficulty, and some edges may even be noisy to the downstream tasks. Therefore, existing GNNs may lead to suboptimal learned representations because they usually treat every edge in the graph equally. On the other hand, Curriculum Learning (CL), which mimics the human learning principle of learning data samples in a meaningful order, has been shown to be effective in improving the generalization ability and robustness of representation learners by gradually proceeding from easy to more difficult samples during training. Unfortunately, existing CL strategies are designed for independent data samples and cannot trivially generalize to handle data dependencies. To address these issues, we propose a novel CL strategy to gradually incorporate more edges into training according to their difficulty from easy to hard, where the degree of difficulty is measured by how well the edges are expected given the model training status. We demonstrate the strength of our proposed method in improving the generalization ability and robustness of learned representations through extensive experiments on nine synthetic datasets and nine real-world datasets. The code for our proposed method is available at https://github.com/rollingstonezz/Curriculum_learning_for_GNNs.

**ABSTRACT**  
Multi-view or even multi-modal data is appealing yet challenging for real-world applications. Detecting anomalies in multi-view data is a prominent recent research topic. However, most of the existing methods 1) are only suitable for two views or type-specific anomalies, 2) suffer from the issue of fusion disentanglement, and 3) do not support online detection after model deployment. To address these challenges, our main ideas in this paper are three-fold: multi-view learning, disentangled representation learning, and generative model. To this end, we propose dPoE, a novel multi-view variational autoencoder model that involves (1) a Product-of-Experts (PoE) layer in tackling multi-view data, (2) a Total Correction (TC) discriminator in disentangling view-common and view-specific representations, and (3) a joint loss function in wrapping up all components. In addition, we devise theoretical information bounds to control both view-common and view-specific representations. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed dPoE outperforms baselines markedly.

**ABSTRACT**  
Spectral embedding is a powerful graph embedding technique that has received a lot of attention recently due to its effectiveness on Graph Transformers. However, from a theoretical perspective, the universal expressive power of spectral embedding comes at the price of losing two important invariance properties of graphs, sign and basis invariance, which also limits its effectiveness on graph data. To remedy this issue, many previous methods developed costly approaches to learn new invariants and suffer from high computation complexity. In this work, we explore a minimal approach that resolves the ambiguity issues by directly finding canonical directions for the eigenvectors, named Laplacian Canonization (LC). As a pure pre-processing method, LC is light-weighted and can be applied to any existing GNNs. We provide a thorough investigation, from theory to algorithm, on this approach, and discover an efficient algorithm named Maximal Axis Projection (MAP) that works for both sign and basis invariance and successfully canonizes more than 90% of all eigenvectors. Experiments on real-world benchmark datasets like ZINC, MOLTOX21, and MOLPCBA show that MAP consistently outperforms existing methods while bringing minimal computation overhead.

**ABSTRACT**  
Time-series learning is the bread and butter of data-driven *clinical decision support*, and the recent explosion in ML research has demonstrated great potential in various healthcare settings. At the same time, medical time-series problems in the wild are challenging due to their highly *composite* nature: They entail design choices and interactions among components that preprocess data, impute missing values, select features, issue predictions, estimate uncertainty, and interpret models. Despite exponential growth in electronic patient data, there is a remarkable gap between the potential and realized utilization of ML for clinical research and decision support. In particular, orchestrating a real-world project lifecycle poses challenges in engineering (i.e. hard to build), evaluation (i.e. hard to assess), and efficiency (i.e. hard to optimize). Designed to address these issues simultaneously, Clairvoyance proposes a unified, end-to-end, autoML-friendly pipeline that serves as a (i) software toolkit, (ii) empirical standard, and (iii) interface for optimization. Our ultimate goal lies in facilitating transparent and reproducible experimentation with complex inference workflows, providing integrated pathways for (1) personalized prediction, (2) treatment-effect estimation, and (3) information acquisition. Through illustrative examples on real-world data in outpatient, general wards, and intensive-care settings, we illustrate the applicability of the pipeline paradigm on core tasks in the healthcare journey. To the best of our knowledge, Clairvoyance is the first to demonstrate viability of a comprehensive and automatable pipeline for clinical time-series ML.

**ABSTRACT**  
We present a new method of training energy-based models (EBMs) for anomaly detection that leverages low-dimensional structures within data. The proposed algorithm, Manifold Projection-Diffusion Recovery (MPDR), first perturbs a data point along a low-dimensional manifold that approximates the training dataset. Then, EBM is trained to maximize the probability of recovering the original data. The training involves the generation of negative samples via MCMC, as in conventional EBM training, but from a different distribution concentrated near the manifold. The resulting near-manifold negative samples are highly informative, reflecting relevant modes of variation in data. An energy function of MPDR effectively learns accurate boundaries of the training data distribution and excels at detecting out-of-distribution samples. Experimental results show that MPDR exhibits strong performance across various anomaly detection tasks involving diverse data types, such as images, vectors, and acoustic signals.

**ABSTRACT**  
This work presents a graph neural network (GNN) framework for solving the maximum independent set (MIS) problem, inspired by dynamic programming (DP). Specifically, given a graph, we propose a DP-like recursive algorithm based on GNNs that firstly constructs two smaller sub-graphs, predicts the one with the larger MIS, and then uses it in the next recursive call. To train our algorithm, we require annotated comparisons of different graphs concerning their MIS size. Annotating the comparisons with the output of our algorithm leads to a self-training process that results in more accurate self-annotation of the comparisons and vice versa. We provide numerical evidence showing the superiority of our method vs prior methods in multiple synthetic and real-world datasets.

**ABSTRACT**  
The cross-pollination of deep learning and causal discovery has catalyzed a burgeoning field of research seeking to elucidate causal relationships within non-statistical data forms like images, videos, and text. Such data, often being named `indefinite data', exhibit unique challenges-inconsistency between causal structure and representation, which are not common in conventional data forms. To tackle this issue, we theoretically develop intervention strategies suitable for indefinite data and derive causal consistency condition (CCC). Moreover, we design a self-supervised learning (SSL) framework that considers interventions as `views' and CCC as a `philosophy' with two implement examples on Supervised Specialized Models (SSMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs), respectively. To evaluate pure inconsistency manifestations, we have prepared the first high-quality causal dialogue dataset-Causalogue. Evaluations are also performed on three other downstream tasks. Extensive experimentation has substantiated the efficacy of our methodology, illuminating how CCC could potentially play an influential role in various fields.

**ABSTRACT**  
In the field of natural language processing, the prevalent approach involves fine-tuning pretrained language models (PLMs) using local samples. Recent research has exposed the susceptibility of PLMs to backdoor attacks, wherein the adversaries can embed malicious prediction behaviors by manipulating a few training samples. In this study, our objective is to develop a backdoor-resistant tuning procedure that yields a backdoor-free model, no matter whether the fine-tuning dataset contains poisoned samples. To this end, we propose and integrate a honeypot module into the original PLM, specifically designed to absorb backdoor information exclusively. Our design is motivated by the observation that lower-layer representations in PLMs carry sufficient backdoor features while carrying minimal information about the original tasks. Consequently, we can impose penalties on the information acquired by the honeypot module to inhibit backdoor creation during the fine-tuning process of the stem network. Comprehensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets substantiate the effectiveness and robustness of our defensive strategy. Notably, these results indicate a substantial reduction in the attack success rate ranging from 10\% to 40\% when compared to prior state-of-the-art methods.

**ABSTRACT**  
In unsupervised causal representation learning for sequential data with time-delayed latent causal influences, strong identifiability results for the disentanglement of causally-related latent variables have been established in stationary settings by leveraging temporal structure. However, in nonstationary setting, existing work only partially addressed the problem by either utilizing observed auxiliary variables (e.g., class labels and/or domain indexes) as side information or assuming simplified latent causal dynamics. Both constrain the method to a limited range of scenarios. In this study, we further explored the Markov Assumption under time-delayed causally related process in nonstationary setting and showed that under mild conditions, the independent latent components can be recovered from their nonlinear mixture up to a permutation and a component-wise transformation, without the observation of auxiliary variables. We then introduce NCTRL, a principled estimation framework, to reconstruct time-delayed latent causal variables and identify their relations from measured sequential data only. Empirical evaluations demonstrated the reliable identification of time-delayed latent causal influences, with our methodology substantially outperforming existing baselines that fail to exploit the nonstationarity adequately and then, consequently, cannot distinguish distribution shifts.

**ABSTRACT**  
Despite their immense promise in performing a variety of learning tasks, a theoretical understanding of the effectiveness and limitations of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has so far eluded practitioners. This is partly due to the inability to determine the closed forms of the learned functions, making it harder to assess their precise dependence on the training data and to study their generalization properties on unseen datasets. Recent work has shown that randomly initialized DNNs in the infinite width limit converge to kernel machines relying on a Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) with known closed form. These results suggest, and experimental evidence corroborates, that empirical kernel machines can also act as surrogates for finite width DNNs. The high computational cost of assembling the full NTK, however, makes this approach infeasible in practice, motivating the need for low-cost approximations. In the current work, we study the performance of the Conjugate Kernel (CK), an efficient approximation to the NTK that has been observed to yield fairly similar results. For the regression problem of smooth functions and classification using logistic regression, we show that the CK performance is only marginally worse than that of the NTK and, in certain cases, is shown to be superior. In particular, we establish bounds for the relative test losses, verify them with numerical tests, and identify the regularity of the kernel as the key determinant of performance. In addition to providing a theoretical grounding for using CKs instead of NTKs, our framework provides insights into understanding the robustness of the various approximants and suggests a recipe for improving DNN accuracy inexpensively. We present a demonstration of this on the foundation model GPT-2 by comparing its performance on a classification task using a conventional approach and our prescription.

**ABSTRACT**  
Backdoor attacks manipulate model predictions by inserting innocuous triggers into training and test data. We focus on more realistic and more challenging clean-label attacks where the adversarial training examples are correctly labeled. Our attack, LLMBkd, leverages language models to automatically insert diverse style-based triggers into texts. We also propose a poison selection technique to improve the effectiveness of both LLMBkd as well as existing textual backdoor attacks. Lastly, we describe REACT, a baseline defense to mitigate backdoor attacks via antidote training examples. Our evaluations demonstrate LLMBkd's effectiveness and efficiency, where we consistently achieve high attack success rates across a wide range of styles with little effort and no model training.

**ABSTRACT**  
Deep networks tend to learn spurious feature-label correlations in real-world supervised learning tasks. This vulnerability is aggravated in distillation, where a student model may have lesser representational capacity than the corresponding teacher model. Often, knowledge of specific spurious correlations is used to reweight instances & rebalance the learning process. We propose a novel early readout mechanism whereby we attempt to predict the label using representations from earlier network layers. We show that these early readouts automatically identify problem instances or groups in the form of confident, incorrect predictions. Leveraging these signals to modulate the distillation loss on an instance level allows us to substantially improve not only group fairness measures across benchmark datasets, but also overall accuracy of the student model. We also provide secondary analyses that bring insight into the role of feature learning in supervision and distillation.

**ABSTRACT**  
Representation learning stands as one of the critical machine learning techniques across various domains. Through the acquisition of high-quality features, pre-trained embeddings significantly reduce input space redundancy, benefiting downstream pattern recognition tasks such as classification, regression, or detection. Nonetheless, in the domain of tabular data, feature engineering and selection still heavily rely on manual intervention, leading to time-consuming processes and necessitating domain expertise. In response to this challenge, we introduce ReConTab, a deep automatic representation learning framework with regularized contrastive learning. Agnostic to any type of modeling task, ReConTab constructs an asymmetric autoencoder based on the same raw features from model inputs, producing low-dimensional representative embeddings. Specifically, regularization techniques are applied for raw feature selection. Meanwhile, ReConTab leverages contrastive learning to distill the most pertinent information for downstream tasks. Experiments conducted on extensive real-world datasets substantiate the framework's capacity to yield substantial and robust performance improvements. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that pre-trained embeddings can seamlessly integrate as easily adaptable features, enhancing the performance of various traditional methods such as XGBoost and Random Forest.

**ABSTRACT**  
Model hallucination has been a crucial interest of research in Natural Language Generation (NLG). In this work, we propose sequence-level certainty as a common theme over hallucination in NLG, and explore the correlation between sequence-level certainty and the level of hallucination in model responses. We categorize sequence-level certainty into two aspects: probabilistic certainty and semantic certainty, and reveal through experiments on Knowledge-Grounded Dialogue Generation (KGDG) task that both a higher level of probabilistic certainty and a higher level of semantic certainty in model responses are significantly correlated with a lower level of hallucination. What's more, we provide theoretical proof and analysis to show that semantic certainty is a good estimator of probabilistic certainty, and therefore has the potential as an alternative to probability-based certainty estimation in black-box scenarios. Based on the observation on the relationship between certainty and hallucination, we further propose Certainty-based Response Ranking (CRR), a decoding-time method for mitigating hallucination in NLG. Based on our categorization of sequence-level certainty, we propose 2 types of CRR approach: Probabilistic CRR (P-CRR) and Semantic CRR (S-CRR). P-CRR ranks individually sampled model responses using their arithmetic mean log-probability of the entire sequence. S-CRR approaches certainty estimation from meaning-space, and ranks a number of model response candidates based on their semantic certainty level, which is estimated by the entailment-based Agreement Score (AS). Through extensive experiments across 3 KGDG datasets, 3 decoding methods, and on 4 different models, we validate the effectiveness of our 2 proposed CRR methods to reduce model hallucination.

**ABSTRACT**  
Narrative understanding involves capturing the author's cognitive processes, providing insights into their knowledge, intentions, beliefs, and desires. Although large language models (LLMs) excel in generating grammatically coherent text, their ability to comprehend the author's thoughts remains uncertain. This limitation hinders the practical applications of narrative understanding. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive survey of narrative understanding tasks, thoroughly examining their key features, definitions, taxonomy, associated datasets, training objectives, evaluation metrics, and limitations. Furthermore, we explore the potential of expanding the capabilities of modularized LLMs to address novel narrative understanding tasks. By framing narrative understanding as the retrieval of the author's imaginative cues that outline the narrative structure, our study introduces a fresh perspective on enhancing narrative comprehension.

**ABSTRACT**  
Bilingual Lexicon Induction (BLI), where words are translated between two languages, is an important NLP task. While noticeable progress on BLI in rich resource languages using static word embeddings has been achieved. The word translation performance can be further improved by incorporating information from contextualized word embeddings. In this paper, we introduce ProMap, a novel approach for BLI that leverages the power of prompting pretrained multilingual and multidialectal language models to address these challenges. To overcome the employment of subword tokens in these models, ProMap relies on an effective padded prompting of language models with a seed dictionary that achieves good performance when used independently. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of ProMap in re-ranking results from other BLI methods such as with aligned static word embeddings. When evaluated on both rich-resource and low-resource languages, ProMap consistently achieves state-of-the-art results. Furthermore, ProMap enables strong performance in few-shot scenarios (even with less than 10 training examples), making it a valuable tool for low-resource language translation. Overall, we believe our method offers both exciting and promising direction for BLI in general and low-resource languages in particular. ProMap code and data are available at \url{https://github.com/4mekki4/promap}.

**ABSTRACT**  
News media is expected to uphold unbiased reporting. Yet they may still affect public opinion by selectively including or omitting events that support or contradict their ideological positions. Prior work in NLP has only studied media bias via linguistic style and word usage. In this paper, we study to which degree media balances news reporting and affects consumers through event inclusion or omission. We first introduce the task of detecting both partisan and counter-partisan events: events that support or oppose the author's political ideology. To conduct our study, we annotate a high-quality dataset, PAC, containing 8,511 (counter-)partisan event annotations in 304 news articles from ideologically diverse media outlets. We benchmark PAC to highlight the challenges of this task. Our findings highlight both the ways in which the news subtly shapes opinion and the need for large language models that better understand events within a broader context.

**ABSTRACT**  
Structured dropout approaches, such as attention dropout and DropHead, have been investigated to regularize the multi-head attention mechanism in Transformers. In this paper, we propose a new regularization scheme based on token-level rather than structure-level to reduce overfitting. Specifically, we devise a novel Token-Level Masking (TLM) training strategy for Transformers to regularize the connections of self-attention, which consists of two masking techniques that are effective and easy to implement. The underlying idea is to manipulate the connections between tokens in the multi-head attention via masking, where the networks are forced to exploit partial neighbors' information to produce a meaningful representation. The generality and effectiveness of TLM are thoroughly evaluated via extensive experiments on 4 diversified NLP tasks across 18 datasets, including natural language understanding benchmark GLUE, ChineseGLUE, Chinese Grammatical Error Correction, and data-to-text generation. The results indicate that TLM can consistently outperform attention dropout and DropHead, e.g., it increases by 0.5 points relative to DropHead with BERT-large on GLUE. Moreover, TLM can establish a new record on the data-to-text benchmark Rotowire (18.93 BLEU). Our code will be publicly available at https://github.com/Young1993/tlm.

**ABSTRACT**  
Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive performance on a range of NLP tasks, due to the general-purpose linguistic knowledge acquired during pretraining. Existing model interpretability research (Tenney et al., 2019) suggests that a linguistic hierarchy emerges in the LLM layers, with lower layers better suited to solving syntactic tasks and higher layers employed for semantic processing. Yet, little is known about how encodings of different linguistic phenomena interact within the models and to what extent processing of linguistically-related categories relies on the same, shared model representations. In this paper, we propose a framework for testing the joint encoding of linguistic categories in LLMs. Focusing on syntax, we find evidence of joint encoding both at the same (related part-of-speech (POS) classes) and different (POS classes and related syntactic dependency relations) levels of linguistic hierarchy. Our cross-lingual experiments show that the same patterns hold across languages in multilingual LLMs.

**ABSTRACT**  
To this date, the efficacy of the scientific publishing enterprise fundamentally rests on the strength of the peer review process. The journal editor or the conference chair primarily relies on the expert reviewers' assessment, identify points of agreement and disagreement and try to reach a consensus to make a fair and informed decision on whether to accept or reject a paper. However, with the escalating number of submissions requiring review, especially in top-tier Artificial Intelligence (AI) conferences, the editor/chair, among many other works, invests a significant, sometimes stressful effort to mitigate reviewer disagreements. Here in this work, we introduce a novel task of automatically identifying contradictions among reviewers on a given article. To this end, we introduce ContraSciView, a comprehensive review-pair contradiction dataset on around 8.5k papers (with around 28k review pairs containing nearly 50k review pair comments) from the open review-based ICLR and NeurIPS conferences. We further propose a baseline model that detects contradictory statements from the review pairs. To the best of our knowledge, we make the first attempt to identify disagreements among peer reviewers automatically. We make our dataset and code public for further investigations.

**ABSTRACT**  
We propose a self-correction mechanism for Large Language Models (LLMs) to mitigate issues such as toxicity and fact hallucination. This method involves refining model outputs through an ensemble of critics and the model's own feedback. Drawing inspiration from human behavior, we explore whether LLMs can emulate the self-correction process observed in humans who often engage in self-reflection and seek input from others to refine their understanding of complex topics. Our approach is model-agnostic and can be applied across various domains to enhance trustworthiness by addressing fairness, bias, and robustness concerns. We consistently observe performance improvements in LLMs for reducing toxicity and correcting factual errors.

**ABSTRACT**  
Text-to-SQL aims to generate an executable SQL program given the user utterance and the corresponding database schema. To ensure the well-formedness of output SQLs, one prominent approach adopts a grammar-based recurrent decoder to produce the equivalent SQL abstract syntax tree (AST). However, previous methods mainly utilize an RNN-series decoder, which 1) is time-consuming and inefficient and 2) introduces very few structure priors. In this work, we propose an AST structure-aware Transformer decoder (ASTormer) to replace traditional RNN cells. The structural knowledge, such as node types and positions in the tree, is seamlessly incorporated into the decoder via both absolute and relative position embeddings. Besides, the proposed framework is compatible with different traversing orders even considering adaptive node selection. Extensive experiments on five text-to-SQL benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our structured decoder compared to competitive baselines.

**ABSTRACT**  
Electronic Health Records (EHRs), which contain patients' medical histories in various multi-modal formats, often overlook the potential for joint reasoning across imaging and table modalities underexplored in current EHR Question Answering (QA) systems. In this paper, we introduce EHRXQA, a novel multi-modal question answering dataset combining structured EHRs and chest X-ray images. To develop our dataset, we first construct two uni-modal resources: 1) The MIMIC- CXR-VQA dataset, our newly created medical visual question answering (VQA) benchmark, specifically designed to augment the imaging modality in EHR QA, and 2) EHRSQL (MIMIC-IV), a refashioned version of a previously established table-based EHR QA dataset. By integrating these two uni-modal resources, we successfully construct a multi-modal EHR QA dataset that necessitates both uni-modal and cross-modal reasoning. To address the unique challenges of multi-modal questions within EHRs, we propose a NeuralSQL-based strategy equipped with an external VQA API. This pioneering endeavor enhances engagement with multi-modal EHR sources and we believe that our dataset can catalyze advances in real-world medical scenarios such as clinical decision-making and research. EHRXQA is available at https://github.com/baeseongsu/ehrxqa.

**ABSTRACT**  
With the rise of powerful closed-sourced LLMs (ChatGPT, GPT-4), there are increasing interests in distilling the capabilies of close-sourced LLMs to smaller open-sourced LLMs. Previous distillation methods usually prompt ChatGPT to generate a set of instructions and answers, for the student model to learn. However, such standard distillation approach neglects the merits and conditions of the student model. Inspired by modern teaching principles, we design a personalised distillation process, in which the student attempts to solve a task first, then the teacher provides an adaptive refinement for the student to improve. Instead of feeding the student with teacher's prior, personalised distillation enables personalised learning for the student model, as it only learns on examples it makes mistakes upon and learns to improve its own solution. On code generation, personalised distillation consistently outperforms standard distillation with only one third of the data. With only 2.5-3K personalised examples that incur a data-collection cost of 4-6$, we boost CodeGen-mono-16B by 7% to achieve 36.4% pass@1 and StarCoder by 12.2% to achieve 45.8% pass@1 on HumanEval.

**ABSTRACT**  
Many discriminative natural language understanding (NLU) tasks have large label spaces. Learning such a process of large-space decision making is particularly challenging due to the lack of training instances per label and the difficulty of selection among many fine-grained labels. Inspired by dense retrieval methods for passage finding in open-domain QA, we propose a reformulation of large-space discriminative NLU tasks as a learning-to-retrieve task, leading to a novel solution named Dense Decision Retrieval (DDR ). Instead of predicting fine-grained decisions as logits, DDR adopts a dual-encoder architecture that learns to predict by retrieving from a decision thesaurus. This approach not only leverages rich indirect supervision signals from easy-to-consume learning resources for dense retrieval, it also leads to enhanced prediction generalizability with a semantically meaningful representation of the large decision space. When evaluated on tasks with decision spaces ranging from hundreds to hundred-thousand scales, DDR outperforms strong baselines greatly by 27.54% in P@1 on two extreme multi-label classification tasks, 1.17% in F1 score ultra-fine entity typing, and 1.26% in accuracy on three few-shot intent classification tasks on average.

**ABSTRACT**  
Document-level relation extraction (DocRE) involves identifying relations between entities distributed in multiple sentences within a document. Existing methods focus on building a heterogeneous document graph to model the internal structure of an entity and the external interaction between entities. However, there are two drawbacks in existing methods. On one hand, anaphor plays an important role in reasoning to identify relations between entities but is ignored by these methods. On the other hand, these methods achieve cross-sentence entity interactions implicitly by utilizing a document or sentences as intermediate nodes. Such an approach has difficulties in learning fine-grained interactions between entities across different sentences, resulting in sub-optimal performance. To address these issues, we propose an Anaphor-Assisted (AA) framework for DocRE tasks. Experimental results on the widely-used datasets demonstrate that our model achieves a new state-of-the-art performance.

**ABSTRACT**  
Automatic summarization of legal case judgments is a practically important problem that has attracted substantial research efforts in many countries. In the context of the Indian judiciary, there is an additional complexity -- Indian legal case judgments are mostly written in complex English, but a significant portion of India's population lacks command of the English language. Hence, it is crucial to summarize the legal documents in Indian languages to ensure equitable access to justice. While prior research primarily focuses on summarizing legal case judgments in their source languages, this study presents a pioneering effort toward cross-lingual summarization of English legal documents into Hindi, the most frequently spoken Indian language. We construct the first high-quality legal corpus comprising of 3,122 case judgments from prominent Indian courts in English, along with their summaries in both English and Hindi, drafted by legal practitioners. We benchmark the performance of several diverse summarization approaches on our corpus and demonstrate the need for further research in cross-lingual summarization in the legal domain.

**ABSTRACT**  
Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across a wide variety of natural language tasks; however, their large size makes their inference slow and computationally expensive which poses a practical challenge for resource constrained real-world applications. Focusing on this problem, we propose to instruction tune LLMs in a way that enables intermediate layer decoding for efficiently generating text, but importantly without compromising the quality of the generation. Specifically, we instruction tune LLMs with additional explicit Losses from the InTermediate layErs (LITE) and show that it enables these layers to acquire 'good' generation ability without affecting the generation ability of the final layer. We perform 'dynamic confidence-based early exiting' at token level from the intermediate layers which improves the efficiency of inference while maintaining the generation quality. We conduct comprehensive experiments by instruction tuning LLaMA-2 models on the widely used Alpaca dataset and holistically evaluate on four different human-instruction test sets: Vicuna, WizardLM, Koala, and Self-Instruct. We show that 'dynamic early exiting' achieves consistent and considerable cost improvements (37.86% on average) while maintaining the generation quality of the responses. We further conduct a thorough analysis of the results over several important aspects, such as comparing the semantic similarity of the outputs and dissecting the efficiency improvements by comparing the number of tokens generated in the output. In summary, our work contributes to improving the efficiency of LLM inference while maintaining the generation quality, a crucial step en route to enabling their widespread adoption.

**ABSTRACT**  
Automatic bundle construction is a crucial prerequisite step in various bundle-aware online services. Previous approaches are mostly designed to model the bundling strategy of existing bundles. However, it is hard to acquire large-scale well-curated bundle dataset, especially for those platforms that have not offered bundle services before. Even for platforms with mature bundle services, there are still many items that are included in few or even zero bundles, which give rise to sparsity and cold-start challenges in the bundle construction models. To tackle these issues, we target at leveraging multimodal features, item-level user feedback signals, and the bundle composition information, to achieve a comprehensive formulation of bundle construction. Nevertheless, such formulation poses two new technical challenges: 1) how to learn effective representations by optimally unifying multiple features, and 2) how to address the problems of modality missing, noise, and sparsity problems induced by the incomplete query bundles. In this work, to address these technical challenges, we propose a Contrastive Learning-enhanced Hierarchical Encoder method (CLHE). Specifically, we use self-attention modules to combine the multimodal and multi-item features, and then leverage both item- and bundle-level contrastive learning to enhance the representation learning, thus to counter the modality missing, noise, and sparsity problems. Extensive experiments on four datasets in two application domains demonstrate that our method outperforms a list of SOTA methods. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/Xiaohao-Liu/CLHE.

**ABSTRACT**  
Contrastive Learning (CL) has achieved impressive performance in self-supervised learning tasks, showing superior generalization ability. Inspired by the success, adopting CL into collaborative filtering (CF) is prevailing in semi-supervised top-K recommendations. The basic idea is to routinely conduct heuristic-based data augmentation and apply contrastive losses (e.g., InfoNCE) on the augmented views. Yet, some CF-tailored challenges make this adoption suboptimal, such as the issue of out-of-distribution, the risk of false negatives, and the nature of top-K evaluation. They necessitate the CL-based CF scheme to focus more on mining hard negatives and distinguishing false negatives from the vast unlabeled user-item interactions, for informative contrast signals. Worse still, there is limited understanding of contrastive loss in CF methods, especially w.r.t. its generalization ability. To bridge the gap, we delve into the reasons underpinning the success of contrastive loss in CF, and propose a principled Adversarial InfoNCE loss (AdvInfoNCE), which is a variant of InfoNCE, specially tailored for CF methods. AdvInfoNCE adaptively explores and assigns hardness to each negative instance in an adversarial fashion and further utilizes a fine-grained hardness-aware ranking criterion to empower the recommender's generalization ability. Training CF models with AdvInfoNCE, we validate the effectiveness of AdvInfoNCE on both synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets, thus showing its generalization ability to mitigate out-of-distribution problems. Given the theoretical guarantees and empirical superiority of AdvInfoNCE over most contrastive loss functions, we advocate its adoption as a standard loss in recommender systems, particularly for the out-of-distribution tasks. Codes are available at https://github.com/LehengTHU/AdvInfoNCE.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recommender systems have become an essential component of many online platforms, providing personalized recommendations to users. A crucial aspect is embedding techniques that coverts the high-dimensional discrete features, such as user and item IDs, into low-dimensional continuous vectors and can enhance the recommendation performance. Applying embedding techniques captures complex entity relationships and has spurred substantial research. In this survey, we provide an overview of the recent literature on embedding techniques in recommender systems. This survey covers embedding methods like collaborative filtering, self-supervised learning, and graph-based techniques. Collaborative filtering generates embeddings capturing user-item preferences, excelling in sparse data. Self-supervised methods leverage contrastive or generative learning for various tasks. Graph-based techniques like node2vec exploit complex relationships in network-rich environments. Addressing the scalability challenges inherent to embedding methods, our survey delves into innovative directions within the field of recommendation systems. These directions aim to enhance performance and reduce computational complexity, paving the way for improved recommender systems. Among these innovative approaches, we will introduce Auto Machine Learning (AutoML), hash techniques, and quantization techniques in this survey. We discuss various architectures and techniques and highlight the challenges and future directions in these aspects. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art in this rapidly evolving field and serve as a useful resource for researchers and practitioners working in the area of recommender systems.

**ABSTRACT**  
Text-to-SQL allows experts to use databases without in-depth knowledge of them. However, real-world tasks have both query and data ambiguities. Most works on Text-to-SQL focused on query ambiguities and designed chat interfaces for experts to provide clarifications. In contrast, the data management community has long studied data ambiguities, but mainly addresses error detection and correction, rather than documenting them for disambiguation in data tasks. This work delves into these data ambiguities in real-world datasets. We have identified prevalent data ambiguities of value consistency, data coverage, and data granularity that affect tasks. We examine how documentation, originally made to help humans to disambiguate data, can help GPT-4 with Text-to-SQL tasks. By offering documentation on these, we found GPT-4's performance improved by 28.9%.

**ABSTRACT**  
Delegated-Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) blockchains, such as EOSIO, Steem and TRON, are governed by a committee of block producers elected via a coin-based voting system. We recently witnessed the first de facto blockchain takeover that happened between Steem and TRON. Within one hour of this incident, TRON founder took over the entire Steem committee, forcing the original Steem community to leave the blockchain that they maintained for years. This is a historical event in the evolution of blockchains and Web 3.0. Despite its significant disruptive impact, little is known about how vulnerable DPoS blockchains are in general to takeovers and the ways in which we can improve their resistance to takeovers.   In this paper, we demonstrate that the resistance of a DPoS blockchain to takeovers is governed by both the theoretical design and the actual use of its underlying coin-based voting governance system. When voters actively cooperate to resist potential takeovers, our theoretical analysis reveals that the current active resistance of DPoS blockchains is far below the theoretical upper bound. However in practice, voter preferences could be significantly different. This paper presents the first large-scale empirical study of the passive takeover resistance of EOSIO, Steem and TRON. Our study identifies the diversity in voter preferences and characterizes the impact of this diversity on takeover resistance. Through both theoretical and empirical analyses, our study provides novel insights into the security of coin-based voting governance and suggests potential ways to improve the takeover resistance of any blockchain that implements this governance model.

**ABSTRACT**  
As 3D models become critical in today's manufacturing and product design, conventional 3D modeling approaches based on Computer-Aided Design (CAD) are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and have high demands on the creators. This work aims to introduce an alternative approach to 3D modeling by utilizing free-hand sketches to obtain desired 3D models. We introduce Deep3DSketch+, which is a deep-learning algorithm that takes the input of a single free-hand sketch and produces a complete and high-fidelity model that matches the sketch input. The neural network has view- and structural-awareness enabled by a Shape Discriminator (SD) and a Stroke Enhancement Module (SEM), which overcomes the limitations of sparsity and ambiguity of the sketches. The network design also brings high robustness to partial sketch input in industrial applications.Our approach has undergone extensive experiments, demonstrating its state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets. These results validate the effectiveness and superiority of our method compared to existing techniques. We have demonstrated the conversion of free-hand sketches into physical 3D objects using additive manufacturing. We believe that our approach has the potential to accelerate product design and democratize customized manufacturing.

**ABSTRACT**  
Foundation models (FoMos), referring to large-scale AI models, possess human-like capabilities and are able to perform competitively in the domain of human intelligence. The breakthrough in FoMos has inspired researchers to deploy such models in the sixth-generation (6G) mobile networks for automating a broad range of tasks in next-generation mobile applications. While the sizes of FoMos are reaching their peaks, their next phase is expected to focus on fine-tuning the models to specific downstream tasks. This inspires us to propose the vision of FoMo fine-tuning as a 6G service. Its key feature is the exploitation of existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques to tweak only a small fraction of model weights for a FoMo to become customized for a specific task. To materialize the said vision, we survey the state-of-the-art PEFT and then present a novel device-edge fine-tuning (DEFT) framework for providing efficient and privacy-preserving fine-tuning services at the 6G network edge. The framework consists of the following comprehensive set of techniques: 1) Control of fine-tuning parameter sizes in different transformer blocks of a FoMo; 2) Over-the-air computation for realizing neural connections in DEFT; 3) Federated DEFT in a multi-device system by downloading a FoMo emulator or gradients; 4) On-the-fly prompt-ensemble tuning; 5) Device-to-device prompt transfer among devices. Experiments are conducted using pre-trained FoMos with up to 11 billion parameters to demonstrate the effectiveness of DEFT techniques. The article is concluded by presenting future research opportunities.

**ABSTRACT**  
This note is concerned with deterministic constructions of $m \times N$ matrices satisfying a restricted isometry property from $\ell_2$ to $\ell_1$ on $s$-sparse vectors. Similarly to the standard ($\ell_2$ to $\ell_2$) restricted isometry property, such constructions can be found in the regime $m \asymp s^2$, at least in theory. With effectiveness of implementation in mind, two simple constructions are presented in the less pleasing but still relevant regime $m \asymp s^4$. The first one, executing a Las Vegas strategy, is quasideterministic and applies in the real setting. The second one, exploiting Golomb rulers, is explicit and applies to the complex setting. As a stepping stone, an explicit isometric embedding from $\ell_2^n(\mathbb{C})$ to $\ell_4^{cn^2}(\mathbb{C})$ is presented. Finally, the extension of the problem from sparse vectors to low-rank matrices is raised as an open question.

**ABSTRACT**  
Affective polarization has grown dramatically in recent years, with surveys showing that liberals and conservatives not only disagree on policy issues but also dislike and distrust each other. While studies have implicated social media in amplifying polarization, there is a lack of agreement on the mechanisms driving affective polarization and methods to measure it. Our paper addresses these gaps. First, we directly measure affective polarization on social media by quantifying the emotional tone of reply interactions between users. As predicted by affective polarization, in-group interactions between same-partisanship users tend to be positive, while out-group interactions between opposite-partisanship users are characterized by negativity and toxicity. Second, we show that affective polarization generalizes beyond the in-group/out-group dichotomy and can be considered a structural property of social networks. Specifically, we show that emotions vary with network distance between users, with closer interactions eliciting positive emotions and more distant interactions leading to anger, disgust, and toxicity. These findings are consistent across diverse datasets and languages, spanning discussions on topics such as the Covid-19 pandemic, abortion, and the 2017 French Election. Our research provides new insights into the complex social dynamics of affective polarization in the digital age and its implications for political discourse.
