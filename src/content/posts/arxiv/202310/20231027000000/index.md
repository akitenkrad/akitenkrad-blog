**ABSTRACT**  
As artificial intelligence (AI) gains greater adoption in a wide variety of applications, it has immense potential to contribute to mathematical discovery, by guiding conjecture generation, constructing counterexamples, assisting in formalizing mathematics, and discovering connections between different mathematical areas, to name a few.   While prior work has leveraged computers for exhaustive mathematical proof search, recent efforts based on large language models (LLMs) aspire to position computing platforms as co-contributors in the mathematical research process. Despite their current limitations in logic and mathematical tasks, there is growing interest in melding theorem proving systems with foundation models. This work investigates the applicability of LLMs in formalizing advanced mathematical concepts and proposes a framework that can critically review and check mathematical reasoning in research papers. Given the noted reasoning shortcomings of LLMs, our approach synergizes the capabilities of proof assistants, specifically PVS, with LLMs, enabling a bridge between textual descriptions in academic papers and formal specifications in PVS. By harnessing the PVS environment, coupled with data ingestion and conversion mechanisms, we envision an automated process, called \emph{math-PVS}, to extract and formalize mathematical theorems from research papers, offering an innovative tool for academic review and discovery.

**ABSTRACT**  
In urban planning, land use readjustment plays a pivotal role in aligning land use configurations with the current demands for sustainable urban development. However, present-day urban planning practices face two main issues. Firstly, land use decisions are predominantly dependent on human experts. Besides, while resident engagement in urban planning can promote urban sustainability and livability, it is challenging to reconcile the diverse interests of stakeholders. To address these challenges, we introduce a Consensus-based Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning framework for real-world land use readjustment. This framework serves participatory urban planning, allowing diverse intelligent agents as stakeholder representatives to vote for preferred land use types. Within this framework, we propose a novel consensus mechanism in reward design to optimize land utilization through collective decision making. To abstract the structure of the complex urban system, the geographic information of cities is transformed into a spatial graph structure and then processed by graph neural networks. Comprehensive experiments on both traditional top-down planning and participatory planning methods from real-world communities indicate that our computational framework enhances global benefits and accommodates diverse interests, leading to improved satisfaction across different demographic groups. By integrating Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning, our framework ensures that participatory urban planning decisions are more dynamic and adaptive to evolving community needs and provides a robust platform for automating complex real-world urban planning processes.

**ABSTRACT**  
While reinforcement learning has achieved remarkable successes in several domains, its real-world application is limited due to many methods failing to generalise to unfamiliar conditions. In this work, we consider the problem of generalising to new transition dynamics, corresponding to cases in which the environment's response to the agent's actions differs. For example, the gravitational force exerted on a robot depends on its mass and changes the robot's mobility. Consequently, in such cases, it is necessary to condition an agent's actions on extrinsic state information and pertinent contextual information reflecting how the environment responds. While the need for context-sensitive policies has been established, the manner in which context is incorporated architecturally has received less attention. Thus, in this work, we present an investigation into how context information should be incorporated into behaviour learning to improve generalisation. To this end, we introduce a neural network architecture, the Decision Adapter, which generates the weights of an adapter module and conditions the behaviour of an agent on the context information. We show that the Decision Adapter is a useful generalisation of a previously proposed architecture and empirically demonstrate that it results in superior generalisation performance compared to previous approaches in several environments. Beyond this, the Decision Adapter is more robust to irrelevant distractor variables than several alternative methods.

**ABSTRACT**  
Board games are a great source of entertainment for all ages, as they create a competitive and engaging environment, as well as stimulating learning and strategic thinking. It is common for digital versions of board games, as any other type of digital games, to offer the option to select the difficulty of the game. This is usually done by customizing the search parameters of the AI algorithm. However, this approach cannot be extended to General Game Playing agents, as different games might require different parametrization for each difficulty level. In this paper, we present a general approach to implement an artificial intelligence opponent with difficulty levels for zero-sum games, together with a propose of a Minimax-MCTS hybrid algorithm, which combines the minimax search process with GGP aspects of MCTS. This approach was tested in our mobile application LoBoGames, an extensible board games platform, that is intended to have an broad catalog of games, with an emphasis on accessibility: the platform is friendly to visually-impaired users, and is compatible with more than 92\% of Android devices. The tests in this work indicate that both the hybrid Minimax-MCTS and the new difficulty adjustment system are promising GGP approaches that could be expanded in future work.

**ABSTRACT**  
Graph embedding methods such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Graph Transformers have contributed to the development of graph reasoning algorithms for various tasks on knowledge graphs. However, the lack of interpretability and explainability of graph embedding methods has limited their applicability in scenarios requiring explicit reasoning. In this paper, we introduce the Graph Agent (GA), an intelligent agent methodology of leveraging large language models (LLMs), inductive-deductive reasoning modules, and long-term memory for knowledge graph reasoning tasks. GA integrates aspects of symbolic reasoning and existing graph embedding methods to provide an innovative approach for complex graph reasoning tasks. By converting graph structures into textual data, GA enables LLMs to process, reason, and provide predictions alongside human-interpretable explanations. The effectiveness of the GA was evaluated on node classification and link prediction tasks. Results showed that GA reached state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating accuracy of 90.65%, 95.48%, and 89.32% on Cora, PubMed, and PrimeKG datasets, respectively. Compared to existing GNN and transformer models, GA offered advantages of explicit reasoning ability, free-of-training, easy adaption to various graph reasoning tasks

**ABSTRACT**  
Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems have made remarkable progress, attaining super-human performance across various domains. This presents us with an opportunity to further human knowledge and improve human expert performance by leveraging the hidden knowledge encoded within these highly performant AI systems. Yet, this knowledge is often hard to extract, and may be hard to understand or learn from. Here, we show that this is possible by proposing a new method that allows us to extract new chess concepts in AlphaZero, an AI system that mastered the game of chess via self-play without human supervision. Our analysis indicates that AlphaZero may encode knowledge that extends beyond the existing human knowledge, but knowledge that is ultimately not beyond human grasp, and can be successfully learned from. In a human study, we show that these concepts are learnable by top human experts, as four top chess grandmasters show improvements in solving the presented concept prototype positions. This marks an important first milestone in advancing the frontier of human knowledge by leveraging AI; a development that could bear profound implications and help us shape how we interact with AI systems across many AI applications.

**ABSTRACT**  
Artificial intelligence (AI) has witnessed an evolution from task-specific to general-purpose systems that trend toward human versatility. As AI systems begin to play pivotal roles in society, it is important to ensure that they are adequately evaluated. Current AI benchmarks typically assess performance on collections of specific tasks. This has drawbacks when used for assessing general-purpose AI systems. First, it is difficult to predict whether AI systems could complete a new task it has never seen or that did not previously exist. Second, these benchmarks often focus on overall performance metrics, potentially overlooking the finer details crucial for making informed decisions. Lastly, there are growing concerns about the reliability of existing benchmarks and questions about what is being measured. To solve these challenges, this paper suggests that psychometrics, the science of psychological measurement, should be placed at the core of evaluating general-purpose AI. Psychometrics provides a rigorous methodology for identifying and measuring the latent constructs that underlie performance across multiple tasks. We discuss its merits, warn against potential pitfalls, and propose a framework for putting it into practice. Finally, we explore future opportunities to integrate psychometrics with AI.

**ABSTRACT**  
The transition of fifth generation (5G) cellular systems to softwarized, programmable, and intelligent networks depends on successfully enabling public and private 5G deployments that are (i) fully software-driven and (ii) with a performance at par with that of traditional monolithic systems. This requires hardware acceleration to scale the Physical (PHY) layer performance, end-to-end integration and testing, and careful planning of the Radio Frequency (RF) environment. In this paper, we describe how the X5G testbed at Northeastern University has addressed these challenges through the first 8-node network deployment of the NVIDIA Aerial Research Cloud (ARC), with the Aerial SDK for the PHY layer, accelerated on Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), and through its integration with higher layers from the OpenAirInterface (OAI) open-source project through the Small Cell Forum Functional Application Platform Interface (FAPI). We discuss software integration, the network infrastructure, and a digital twin framework for RF planning. We then profile the performance with up to 4 Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) smartphones for each base station with iPerf and video streaming applications, measuring a cell rate higher than 500 Mbps in downlink and 45 Mbps in uplink.

**ABSTRACT**  
In ML for network security, traditional workflows rely on high-quality labeled data and manual feature engineering, but limited datasets and human expertise hinder feature selection, leading to models struggling to capture crucial relationships and generalize effectively. Inspired by recent advancements in ML application domains like GPT-4 and Vision Transformers, we have developed netFound, a foundational model for network security. This model undergoes pre-training using self-supervised algorithms applied to readily available unlabeled network packet traces. netFound's design incorporates hierarchical and multi-modal attributes of network traffic, effectively capturing hidden networking contexts, including application logic, communication protocols, and network conditions.   With this pre-trained foundation in place, we can fine-tune netFound for a wide array of downstream tasks, even when dealing with low-quality, limited, and noisy labeled data. Our experiments demonstrate netFound's superiority over existing state-of-the-art ML-based solutions across three distinct network downstream tasks: traffic classification, network intrusion detection, and APT detection. Furthermore, we emphasize netFound's robustness against noisy and missing labels, as well as its ability to generalize across temporal variations and diverse network environments. Finally, through a series of ablation studies, we provide comprehensive insights into how our design choices enable netFound to more effectively capture hidden networking contexts, further solidifying its performance and utility in network security applications.

**ABSTRACT**  
This proposed model introduces novel deep learning methodologies. The objective here is to create a reliable intrusion detection mechanism to help identify malicious attacks. Deep learning based solution framework is developed consisting of three approaches. The first approach is Long-Short Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM-RNN) with seven optimizer functions such as adamax, SGD, adagrad, adam, RMSprop, nadam and adadelta. The model is evaluated on NSL-KDD dataset and classified multi attack classification. The model has outperformed with adamax optimizer in terms of accuracy, detection rate and low false alarm rate. The results of LSTM-RNN with adamax optimizer is compared with existing shallow machine and deep learning models in terms of accuracy, detection rate and low false alarm rate. The multi model methodology consisting of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long-Short Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM-RNN), and Deep Neural Network (DNN). The multi models are evaluated on bench mark datasets such as KDD99, NSL-KDD, and UNSWNB15 datasets. The models self-learnt the features and classifies the attack classes as multi-attack classification. The models RNN, and LSTM-RNN provide considerable performance compared to other existing methods on KDD99 and NSL-KDD dataset

**ABSTRACT**  
Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 have demonstrated a strong capability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text. However, amidst their successes, a crucial issue persists: their generated outputs still lack commonsense at times. Moreover, fine-tuning the entire LLM towards more commonsensical outputs is computationally expensive if not infeasible. In this paper, we present a computation-efficient framework that steers a frozen Pre-Trained Language Model (PTLM) towards more commonsensical generation (i.e., producing a plausible output that incorporates a list of concepts in a meaningful way). Specifically, we first construct a reference-free evaluator that assigns a sentence with a commonsensical score by grounding the sentence to a dynamic commonsense knowledge base from four different relational aspects. We then use the scorer as the oracle for commonsense knowledge, and extend the controllable generation method called NADO to train an auxiliary head that guides a fixed PTLM to better satisfy the oracle. We test our framework on a series of GPT-2-, Flan-T5-, and Alpaca-based language models (LMs) on two constrained concept-to-sentence benchmarks. Human evaluation results demonstrate that our method consistently leads to the most commonsensical outputs.

**ABSTRACT**  
Fine-tuning all the layers of a pre-trained neural language encoder (either using all the parameters or using parameter-efficient methods) is often the de-facto way of adapting it to a new task. We show evidence that for different downstream language tasks, fine-tuning only a subset of layers is sufficient to obtain performance that is close to and often better than fine-tuning all the layers in the language encoder. We propose an efficient metric based on the diagonal of the Fisher information matrix (FIM score), to select the candidate layers for selective fine-tuning. We show, empirically on GLUE and SuperGLUE tasks and across distinct language encoders, that this metric can effectively select layers leading to a strong downstream performance. Our work highlights that task-specific information corresponding to a given downstream task is often localized within a few layers, and tuning only those is sufficient for strong performance. Additionally, we demonstrate the robustness of the FIM score to rank layers in a manner that remains constant during the optimization process.

**ABSTRACT**  
The adoption of voice assistants like Alexa or Siri has grown rapidly, allowing users to instantly access information via voice search. Query suggestion is a standard feature of screen-based search experiences, allowing users to explore additional topics. However, this is not trivial to implement in voice-based settings. To enable this, we tackle the novel task of suggesting questions with compact and natural voice hints to allow users to ask follow-up questions.   We define the task, ground it in syntactic theory and outline linguistic desiderata for spoken hints. We propose baselines and an approach using sequence-to-sequence Transformers to generate spoken hints from a list of questions. Using a new dataset of 6681 input questions and human written hints, we evaluated the models with automatic metrics and human evaluation. Results show that a naive approach of concatenating suggested questions creates poor voice hints. Our approach, which applies a linguistically-motivated pretraining task was strongly preferred by humans for producing the most natural hints.

**ABSTRACT**  
Emotion recognition in text, the task of identifying emotions such as joy or anger, is a challenging problem in NLP with many applications. One of the challenges is the shortage of available datasets that have been annotated with emotions. Certain existing datasets are small, follow different emotion taxonomies and display imbalance in their emotion distribution. In this work, we studied the impact of data augmentation techniques precisely when applied to small imbalanced datasets, for which current state-of-the-art models (such as RoBERTa) under-perform. Specifically, we utilized four data augmentation methods (Easy Data Augmentation EDA, static and contextual Embedding-based, and ProtAugment) on three datasets that come from different sources and vary in size, emotion categories and distributions. Our experimental results show that using the augmented data when training the classifier model leads to significant improvements. Finally, we conducted two case studies: a) directly using the popular chat-GPT API to paraphrase text using different prompts, and b) using external data to augment the training set. Results show the promising potential of these methods.

**ABSTRACT**  
Prototype learning, a popular machine learning method designed for inherently interpretable decisions, leverages similarities to learned prototypes for classifying new data. While it is mainly applied in computer vision, in this work, we build upon prior research and further explore the extension of prototypical networks to natural language processing. We introduce a learned weighted similarity measure that enhances the similarity computation by focusing on informative dimensions of pre-trained sentence embeddings. Additionally, we propose a post-hoc explainability mechanism that extracts prediction-relevant words from both the prototype and input sentences. Finally, we empirically demonstrate that our proposed method not only improves predictive performance on the AG News and RT Polarity datasets over a previous prototype-based approach, but also improves the faithfulness of explanations compared to rationale-based recurrent convolutions.

**ABSTRACT**  
Domain adaptation, the process of training a model in one domain and applying it to another, has been extensively explored in machine learning. While training a domain-specific foundation model (FM) from scratch is an option, recent methods have focused on adapting pre-trained FMs for domain-specific tasks. However, our experiments reveal that either approach does not consistently achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in the target domain. In this work, we study extractive question answering within closed domains and introduce the concept of targeted pre-training. This involves determining and generating relevant data to further pre-train our models, as opposed to the conventional philosophy of utilizing domain-specific FMs trained on a wide range of data. Our proposed framework uses Galactica to generate synthetic, ``targeted'' corpora that align with specific writing styles and topics, such as research papers and radiology reports. This process can be viewed as a form of knowledge distillation. We apply our method to two biomedical extractive question answering datasets, COVID-QA and RadQA, achieving a new benchmark on the former and demonstrating overall improvements on the latter.

With the rise of generative pre-trained transformer models such as GPT-3, GPT-NeoX, or OPT, distinguishing human-generated texts from machine-generated ones has become important. We refined five separate language models to generate synthetic tweets, uncovering that shallow learning classification algorithms, like Naive Bayes, achieve detection accuracy between 0.6 and 0.8.   Shallow learning classifiers differ from human-based detection, especially when using higher temperature values during text generation, resulting in a lower detection rate. Humans prioritize linguistic acceptability, which tends to be higher at lower temperature values. In contrast, transformer-based classifiers have an accuracy of 0.9 and above. We found that using a reinforcement learning approach to refine our generative models can successfully evade BERT-based classifiers with a detection accuracy of 0.15 or less.

**ABSTRACT**  
Social structures and real-world incidents often influence contemporary literary fiction. Existing research in literary fiction analysis explains these real-world phenomena through the manual critical analysis of stories. Conventional Natural Language Processing (NLP) methodologies, including sentiment analysis, narrative summarization, and topic modeling, have demonstrated substantial efficacy in analyzing and identifying similarities within fictional works. However, the intricate dynamics of character interactions within fiction necessitate a more nuanced approach that incorporates visualization techniques. Character interaction graphs (or networks) emerge as a highly suitable means for visualization and information retrieval from the realm of fiction. Therefore, we leverage character interaction graphs with NLP-derived features to explore a diverse spectrum of societal inquiries about contemporary culture's impact on the landscape of literary fiction. Our study involves constructing character interaction graphs from fiction, extracting relevant graph features, and exploiting these features to resolve various real-life queries. Experimental evaluation of influential Bengali fiction over half a century demonstrates that character interaction graphs can be highly effective in specific assessments and information retrieval from literary fiction.

**ABSTRACT**  
Modern multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems like Whisper have made it possible to transcribe audio in multiple languages with a single model. However, current state-of-the-art ASR models are typically evaluated on individual languages or in a multi-task setting, overlooking the challenge of continually learning new languages. There is insufficient research on how to add new languages without losing valuable information from previous data. Furthermore, existing continual learning benchmarks focus mostly on vision and language tasks, leaving continual learning for multilingual ASR largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose CL-MASR, a benchmark designed for studying multilingual ASR in a continual learning setting. CL-MASR provides a diverse set of continual learning methods implemented on top of large-scale pretrained ASR models, along with common metrics to assess the effectiveness of learning new languages while addressing the issue of catastrophic forgetting. To the best of our knowledge, CL-MASR is the first continual learning benchmark for the multilingual ASR task. The code is available at https://github.com/speechbrain/benchmarks.

**ABSTRACT**  
A major challenge in the practical use of Machine Translation (MT) is that users lack guidance to make informed decisions about when to rely on outputs. Progress in quality estimation research provides techniques to automatically assess MT quality, but these techniques have primarily been evaluated in vitro by comparison against human judgments outside of a specific context of use. This paper evaluates quality estimation feedback in vivo with a human study simulating decision-making in high-stakes medical settings. Using Emergency Department discharge instructions, we study how interventions based on quality estimation versus backtranslation assist physicians in deciding whether to show MT outputs to a patient. We find that quality estimation improves appropriate reliance on MT, but backtranslation helps physicians detect more clinically harmful errors that QE alone often misses.

**ABSTRACT**  
The growing capabilities of transformer models pave the way for solving increasingly complex NLP tasks. A key to supporting application-specific requirements is the ability to fine-tune. However, compiling a fine-tuning dataset tailored to complex tasks is tedious and results in large datasets, limiting the ability to control transformer output. We present an approach in which complex tasks are divided into simpler subtasks. Multiple transformer models are fine-tuned to one subtask each, and lined up to accomplish the complex task. This simplifies the compilation of fine-tuning datasets and increases overall controllability. Using the example of reducing gender bias as a complex task, we demonstrate our approach and show that it performs better than using a single model.

**ABSTRACT**  
We propose LLM-FP4 for quantizing both weights and activations in large language models (LLMs) down to 4-bit floating-point values, in a post-training manner. Existing post-training quantization (PTQ) solutions are primarily integer-based and struggle with bit widths below 8 bits. Compared to integer quantization, floating-point (FP) quantization is more flexible and can better handle long-tail or bell-shaped distributions, and it has emerged as a default choice in many hardware platforms. One characteristic of FP quantization is that its performance largely depends on the choice of exponent bits and clipping range. In this regard, we construct a strong FP-PTQ baseline by searching for the optimal quantization parameters. Furthermore, we observe a high inter-channel variance and low intra-channel variance pattern in activation distributions, which adds activation quantization difficulty. We recognize this pattern to be consistent across a spectrum of transformer models designed for diverse tasks, such as LLMs, BERT, and Vision Transformer models. To tackle this, we propose per-channel activation quantization and show that these additional scaling factors can be reparameterized as exponential biases of weights, incurring a negligible cost. Our method, for the first time, can quantize both weights and activations in the LLaMA-13B to only 4-bit and achieves an average score of 63.1 on the common sense zero-shot reasoning tasks, which is only 5.8 lower than the full-precision model, significantly outperforming the previous state-of-the-art by 12.7 points.

**ABSTRACT**  
How can we better extract entities and relations from text? Using multimodal extraction with images and text obtains more signals for entities and relations, and aligns them through graphs or hierarchical fusion, aiding in extraction. Despite attempts at various fusions, previous works have overlooked many unlabeled image-caption pairs, such as NewsCLIPing. This paper proposes innovative pre-training objectives for entity-object and relation-image alignment, extracting objects from images and aligning them with entity and relation prompts for soft pseudo-labels. These labels are used as self-supervised signals for pre-training, enhancing the ability to extract entities and relations. Experiments on three datasets show an average 3.41% F1 improvement over prior SOTA. Additionally, our method is orthogonal to previous multimodal fusions, and using it on prior SOTA fusions further improves 5.47% F1.

**ABSTRACT**  
This study explores the capabilities of prompt-driven Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and GPT-4 in adhering to human guidelines for dialogue summarization. Experiments employed DialogSum (English social conversations) and DECODA (French call center interactions), testing various prompts: including prompts from existing literature and those from human summarization guidelines, as well as a two-step prompt approach. Our findings indicate that GPT models often produce lengthy summaries and deviate from human summarization guidelines. However, using human guidelines as an intermediate step shows promise, outperforming direct word-length constraint prompts in some cases. The results reveal that GPT models exhibit unique stylistic tendencies in their summaries. While BERTScores did not dramatically decrease for GPT outputs suggesting semantic similarity to human references and specialised pre-trained models, ROUGE scores reveal grammatical and lexical disparities between GPT-generated and human-written summaries. These findings shed light on the capabilities and limitations of GPT models in following human instructions for dialogue summarization.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recently, code language models have achieved notable advancements in addressing a diverse array of essential code comprehension and generation tasks. Yet, the field lacks a comprehensive deep dive and understanding of the code embeddings of multilingual code models. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study on multilingual code embeddings, focusing on the cross-lingual capabilities of these embeddings across different programming languages. Through probing experiments, we demonstrate that code embeddings comprise two distinct components: one deeply tied to the nuances and syntax of a specific language, and the other remaining agnostic to these details, primarily focusing on semantics. Further, we show that when we isolate and eliminate this language-specific component, we witness significant improvements in downstream code retrieval tasks, leading to an absolute increase of up to +17 in the Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR).

**ABSTRACT**  
To achieve state-of-the-art performance, one still needs to train NER models on large-scale, high-quality annotated data, an asset that is both costly and time-intensive to accumulate. In contrast, real-world applications often resort to massive low-quality labeled data through non-expert annotators via crowdsourcing and external knowledge bases via distant supervision as a cost-effective alternative. However, these annotation methods result in noisy labels, which in turn lead to a notable decline in performance. Hence, we propose to denoise the noisy NER data with guidance from a small set of clean instances. Along with the main NER model we train a discriminator model and use its outputs to recalibrate the sample weights. The discriminator is capable of detecting both span and category errors with different discriminative prompts. Results on public crowdsourcing and distant supervision datasets show that the proposed method can consistently improve performance with a small guidance set.

**ABSTRACT**  
Although large language models (LLMs) are widely deployed, the data used to train them is rarely disclosed. Given the incredible scale of this data, up to trillions of tokens, it is all but certain that it includes potentially problematic text such as copyrighted materials, personally identifiable information, and test data for widely reported reference benchmarks. However, we currently have no way to know which data of these types is included or in what proportions. In this paper, we study the pretraining data detection problem: given a piece of text and black-box access to an LLM without knowing the pretraining data, can we determine if the model was trained on the provided text? To facilitate this study, we introduce a dynamic benchmark WIKIMIA that uses data created before and after model training to support gold truth detection. We also introduce a new detection method Min-K% Prob based on a simple hypothesis: an unseen example is likely to contain a few outlier words with low probabilities under the LLM, while a seen example is less likely to have words with such low probabilities. Min-K% Prob can be applied without any knowledge about the pretraining corpus or any additional training, departing from previous detection methods that require training a reference model on data that is similar to the pretraining data. Moreover, our experiments demonstrate that Min-K% Prob achieves a 7.4% improvement on WIKIMIA over these previous methods. We apply Min-K% Prob to two real-world scenarios, copyrighted book detection, and contaminated downstream example detection, and find it a consistently effective solution.

**ABSTRACT**  
The race to train language models on vast, diverse, and inconsistently documented datasets has raised pressing concerns about the legal and ethical risks for practitioners. To remedy these practices threatening data transparency and understanding, we convene a multi-disciplinary effort between legal and machine learning experts to systematically audit and trace 1800+ text datasets. We develop tools and standards to trace the lineage of these datasets, from their source, creators, series of license conditions, properties, and subsequent use. Our landscape analysis highlights the sharp divides in composition and focus of commercially open vs closed datasets, with closed datasets monopolizing important categories: lower resource languages, more creative tasks, richer topic variety, newer and more synthetic training data. This points to a deepening divide in the types of data that are made available under different license conditions, and heightened implications for jurisdictional legal interpretations of copyright and fair use. We also observe frequent miscategorization of licenses on widely used dataset hosting sites, with license omission of 72%+ and error rates of 50%+. This points to a crisis in misattribution and informed use of the most popular datasets driving many recent breakthroughs. As a contribution to ongoing improvements in dataset transparency and responsible use, we release our entire audit, with an interactive UI, the Data Provenance Explorer, which allows practitioners to trace and filter on data provenance for the most popular open source finetuning data collections: www.dataprovenance.org.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recent advances have led to the availability of many pre-trained language models (PLMs); however, a question that remains is how much data is truly needed to fine-tune PLMs for downstream tasks? In this work, we introduce DEFT, a data-efficient fine-tuning framework that leverages unsupervised core-set selection to minimize the amount of data needed to fine-tune PLMs for downstream tasks. We demonstrate the efficacy of our DEFT framework in the context of text-editing LMs, and compare to the state-of-the art text-editing model, CoEDIT. Our quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that DEFT models are just as accurate as CoEDIT while being finetuned on ~70% less data.

**ABSTRACT**  
While large language models demonstrate remarkable capabilities, they often present challenges in terms of safety, alignment with human values, and stability during training. Here, we focus on two prevalent methods used to align these models, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). SFT is simple and robust, powering a host of open-source models, while RLHF is a more sophisticated method used in top-tier models like ChatGPT but also suffers from instability and susceptibility to reward hacking. We propose a novel approach, Supervised Iterative Learning from Human Feedback (SuperHF), which seeks to leverage the strengths of both methods. Our hypothesis is two-fold: that the reward model used in RLHF is critical for efficient data use and model generalization and that the use of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) in RLHF may not be necessary and could contribute to instability issues. SuperHF replaces PPO with a simple supervised loss and a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence prior. It creates its own training data by repeatedly sampling a batch of model outputs and filtering them through the reward model in an online learning regime. We then break down the reward optimization problem into three components: robustly optimizing the training rewards themselves, preventing reward hacking-exploitation of the reward model that degrades model performance-as measured by a novel METEOR similarity metric, and maintaining good performance on downstream evaluations. Our experimental results show SuperHF exceeds PPO-based RLHF on the training objective, easily and favorably trades off high reward with low reward hacking, improves downstream calibration, and performs the same on our GPT-4 based qualitative evaluation scheme all the while being significantly simpler to implement, highlighting SuperHF's potential as a competitive language model alignment technique.

**ABSTRACT**  
Identifying intents from dialogue utterances forms an integral component of task-oriented dialogue systems. Intent-related tasks are typically formulated either as a classification task, where the utterances are classified into predefined categories or as a clustering task when new and previously unknown intent categories need to be discovered from these utterances. Further, the intent classification may be modeled in a multiclass (MC) or multilabel (ML) setup. While typically these tasks are modeled as separate tasks, we propose IntenDD, a unified approach leveraging a shared utterance encoding backbone. IntenDD uses an entirely unsupervised contrastive learning strategy for representation learning, where pseudo-labels for the unlabeled utterances are generated based on their lexical features. Additionally, we introduce a two-step post-processing setup for the classification tasks using modified adsorption. Here, first, the residuals in the training data are propagated followed by smoothing the labels both modeled in a transductive setting. Through extensive evaluations on various benchmark datasets, we find that our approach consistently outperforms competitive baselines across all three tasks. On average, IntenDD reports percentage improvements of 2.32%, 1.26%, and 1.52% in their respective metrics for few-shot MC, few-shot ML, and the intent discovery tasks respectively.

**ABSTRACT**  
Theory of Mind (ToM) is the ability to reason about one's own and others' mental states. ToM plays a critical role in the development of intelligence, language understanding, and cognitive processes. While previous work has primarily focused on first and second-order ToM, we explore higher-order ToM, which involves recursive reasoning on others' beliefs. We introduce HI-TOM, a Higher Order Theory of Mind benchmark. Our experimental evaluation using various Large Language Models (LLMs) indicates a decline in performance on higher-order ToM tasks, demonstrating the limitations of current LLMs. We conduct a thorough analysis of different failure cases of LLMs, and share our thoughts on the implications of our findings on the future of NLP.

**ABSTRACT**  
Disfluency correction (DC) is the process of removing disfluent elements like fillers, repetitions and corrections from spoken utterances to create readable and interpretable text. DC is a vital post-processing step applied to Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) outputs, before subsequent processing by downstream language understanding tasks. Existing DC research has primarily focused on English due to the unavailability of large-scale open-source datasets. Towards the goal of multilingual disfluency correction, we present a high-quality human-annotated DC corpus covering four important Indo-European languages: English, Hindi, German and French. We provide extensive analysis of results of state-of-the-art DC models across all four languages obtaining F1 scores of 97.55 (English), 94.29 (Hindi), 95.89 (German) and 92.97 (French). To demonstrate the benefits of DC on downstream tasks, we show that DC leads to 5.65 points increase in BLEU scores on average when used in conjunction with a state-of-the-art Machine Translation (MT) system. We release code to run our experiments along with our annotated dataset here.

**ABSTRACT**  
Authorship Analysis, also known as stylometry, has been an essential aspect of Natural Language Processing (NLP) for a long time. Likewise, the recent advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has made authorship analysis increasingly crucial for distinguishing between human-written and AI-generated texts. However, these authorship analysis tasks have primarily been focused on written texts, not considering spoken texts. Thus, we introduce the largest benchmark for spoken texts - HANSEN (Human ANd ai Spoken tExt beNchmark). HANSEN encompasses meticulous curation of existing speech datasets accompanied by transcripts, alongside the creation of novel AI-generated spoken text datasets. Together, it comprises 17 human datasets, and AI-generated spoken texts created using 3 prominent LLMs: ChatGPT, PaLM2, and Vicuna13B. To evaluate and demonstrate the utility of HANSEN, we perform Authorship Attribution (AA) & Author Verification (AV) on human-spoken datasets and conducted Human vs. AI spoken text detection using state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. While SOTA methods, such as, character ngram or Transformer-based model, exhibit similar AA & AV performance in human-spoken datasets compared to written ones, there is much room for improvement in AI-generated spoken text detection. The HANSEN benchmark is available at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/HANSEN-REPO/HANSEN.

**ABSTRACT**  
Conversational Recommendation System (CRS) is a rapidly growing research area that has gained significant attention alongside advancements in language modelling techniques. However, the current state of conversational recommendation faces numerous challenges due to its relative novelty and limited existing contributions. In this study, we delve into benchmark datasets for developing CRS models and address potential biases arising from the feedback loop inherent in multi-turn interactions, including selection bias and multiple popularity bias variants. Drawing inspiration from the success of generative data via using language models and data augmentation techniques, we present two novel strategies, 'Once-Aug' and 'PopNudge', to enhance model performance while mitigating biases. Through extensive experiments on ReDial and TG-ReDial benchmark datasets, we show a consistent improvement of CRS techniques with our data augmentation approaches and offer additional insights on addressing multiple newly formulated biases.

**ABSTRACT**  
Spatial reasoning over text is challenging as the models not only need to extract the direct spatial information from the text but also reason over those and infer implicit spatial relations. Recent studies highlight the struggles even large language models encounter when it comes to performing spatial reasoning over text. In this paper, we explore the potential benefits of disentangling the processes of information extraction and reasoning in models to address this challenge. To explore this, we design various models that disentangle extraction and reasoning(either symbolic or neural) and compare them with state-of-the-art(SOTA) baselines with no explicit design for these parts. Our experimental results consistently demonstrate the efficacy of disentangling, showcasing its ability to enhance models' generalizability within realistic data domains.

**ABSTRACT**  
Large language models (LLMs) have become an integral component in solving a wide range of NLP tasks. In this work, we explore a novel use case of using LLMs to build performance predictors (PP): models that, given a specific deep neural network architecture, predict its performance on a downstream task. We design PP prompts for LLMs consisting of: (i) role: description of the role assigned to the LLM, (ii) instructions: set of instructions to be followed by the LLM to carry out performance prediction, (iii) hyperparameters: a definition of each architecture-specific hyperparameter and (iv) demonstrations: sample architectures along with their efficiency metrics and 'training from scratch' performance. For machine translation (MT) tasks, we discover that GPT-4 with our PP prompts (LLM-PP) can predict the performance of architecture with a mean absolute error matching the SOTA and a marginal degradation in rank correlation coefficient compared to SOTA performance predictors. Further, we show that the predictions from LLM-PP can be distilled to a small regression model (LLM-Distill-PP). LLM-Distill-PP models surprisingly retain the performance of LLM-PP largely and can be a cost-effective alternative for heavy use cases of performance estimation. Specifically, for neural architecture search (NAS), we propose a Hybrid-Search algorithm for NAS (HS-NAS), which uses LLM-Distill-PP for the initial part of search, resorting to the baseline predictor for rest of the search. We show that HS-NAS performs very similar to SOTA NAS across benchmarks, reduces search hours by 50% roughly, and in some cases, improves latency, GFLOPs, and model size.

**ABSTRACT**  
The large language based-model chatbot ChatGPT gained a lot of popularity since its launch and has been used in a wide range of situations. This research centers around a particular situation, when the ChatGPT is used to produce news that will be consumed by the population, causing the facilitation in the production of fake news, spread of misinformation and lack of trust in news sources. Aware of these problems, this research aims to build an artificial intelligence model capable of performing authorship attribution on news articles, identifying the ones written by the ChatGPT. To achieve this goal, a dataset containing equal amounts of human and ChatGPT written news was assembled and different natural processing language techniques were used to extract features from it that were used to train, validate and test three models built with different techniques. The best performance was produced by the Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network model, achiving 91.57\% accuracy when tested against the data from the testing set.

**ABSTRACT**  
Language models have seen significant growth in the size of their corpus, leading to notable performance improvements. Yet, there has been limited progress in developing models that handle smaller, more human-like datasets. As part of the BabyLM shared task, this study explores the impact of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) on language models pretrained from scratch with a limited training corpus. Comparing two GPT-2 variants, the larger model performs better in storytelling tasks after RLHF fine-tuning. These findings suggest that RLHF techniques may be more advantageous for larger models due to their higher learning and adaptation capacity, though more experiments are needed to confirm this finding. These insights highlight the potential benefits of RLHF fine-tuning for language models within limited data, enhancing their ability to maintain narrative focus and coherence while adhering better to initial instructions in storytelling tasks.

**ABSTRACT**  
Emotion recognition in conversations (ERC) is a rapidly evolving task within the natural language processing community, which aims to detect the emotions expressed by speakers during a conversation. Recently, a growing number of ERC methods have focused on leveraging supervised contrastive learning (SCL) to enhance the robustness and generalizability of learned features. However, current SCL-based approaches in ERC are impeded by the constraint of large batch sizes and the lack of compatibility with most existing ERC models. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient and model-agnostic SCL framework named Supervised Sample-Label Contrastive Learning with Soft-HGR Maximal Correlation (SSLCL), which eliminates the need for a large batch size and can be seamlessly integrated with existing ERC models without introducing any model-specific assumptions. Specifically, we introduce a novel perspective on utilizing label representations by projecting discrete labels into dense embeddings through a shallow multilayer perceptron, and formulate the training objective to maximize the similarity between sample features and their corresponding ground-truth label embeddings, while minimizing the similarity between sample features and label embeddings of disparate classes. Moreover, we innovatively adopt the Soft-HGR maximal correlation as a measure of similarity between sample features and label embeddings, leading to significant performance improvements over conventional similarity measures. Additionally, multimodal cues of utterances are effectively leveraged by SSLCL as data augmentations to boost model performances. Extensive experiments on two ERC benchmark datasets, IEMOCAP and MELD, demonstrate the compatibility and superiority of our proposed SSLCL framework compared to existing state-of-the-art SCL methods.

**ABSTRACT**  
Pre-trained language models have been widely used in dependency parsing task and have achieved significant improvements in parser performance. However, it remains an understudied question whether pre-trained language models can spontaneously exhibit the ability of dependency parsing without introducing additional parser structure in the zero-shot scenario. In this paper, we propose to explore the dependency parsing ability of large language models such as ChatGPT and conduct linguistic analysis. The experimental results demonstrate that ChatGPT is a potential zero-shot dependency parser, and the linguistic analysis also shows some unique preferences in parsing outputs.

**ABSTRACT**  
We present ArTST, a pre-trained Arabic text and speech transformer for supporting open-source speech technologies for the Arabic language. The model architecture follows the unified-modal framework, SpeechT5, that was recently released for English, and is focused on Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), with plans to extend the model for dialectal and code-switched Arabic in future editions. We pre-trained the model from scratch on MSA speech and text data, and fine-tuned it for the following tasks: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Text-To-Speech synthesis (TTS), and spoken dialect identification. In our experiments comparing ArTST with SpeechT5, as well as with previously reported results in these tasks, ArTST performs on a par with or exceeding the current state-of-the-art in all three tasks. Moreover, we find that our pre-training is conducive for generalization, which is particularly evident in the low-resource TTS task. The pre-trained model as well as the fine-tuned ASR and TTS models are released for research use.

**ABSTRACT**  
In a spoken dialogue system, an NLU model is preceded by a speech recognition system that can deteriorate the performance of natural language understanding. This paper proposes a method for investigating the impact of speech recognition errors on the performance of natural language understanding models. The proposed method combines the back transcription procedure with a fine-grained technique for categorizing the errors that affect the performance of NLU models. The method relies on the usage of synthesized speech for NLU evaluation. We show that the use of synthesized speech in place of audio recording does not change the outcomes of the presented technique in a significant way.

**ABSTRACT**  
In order to build reliable and trustworthy NLP applications, models need to be both fair across different demographics and explainable. Usually these two objectives, fairness and explainability, are optimized and/or examined independently of each other. Instead, we argue that forthcoming, trustworthy NLP systems should consider both. In this work, we perform a first study to understand how they influence each other: do fair(er) models rely on more plausible rationales? and vice versa. To this end, we conduct experiments on two English multi-class text classification datasets, BIOS and ECtHR, that provide information on gender and nationality, respectively, as well as human-annotated rationales. We fine-tune pre-trained language models with several methods for (i) bias mitigation, which aims to improve fairness; (ii) rationale extraction, which aims to produce plausible explanations. We find that bias mitigation algorithms do not always lead to fairer models. Moreover, we discover that empirical fairness and explainability are orthogonal.

**ABSTRACT**  
Personality plays a pivotal role in shaping human expression patterns, and empowering and manipulating large language models (LLMs) with personality traits holds significant promise in enhancing the user experience of LLMs. However, prior approaches either rely on fine-tuning LLMs on a corpus enriched with personalized expressions or necessitate the manual crafting of prompts to induce LLMs to produce personalized responses. The former approaches demand substantial time and resources for collecting sufficient training examples while the latter might fail in enabling the precise manipulation of the personality traits at a fine-grained level (e.g., achieving high agreeableness while reducing openness). In this study, we introduce a novel approach for tailoring personality traits within LLMs, allowing for the incorporation of any combination of the Big Five factors (i.e., openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism) in a pluggable manner. This is achieved by employing a set of Unsupervisedly-Built Personalized Lexicons (UBPL) that are utilized to adjust the probability of the next token predicted by the original LLMs during the decoding phase. This adjustment encourages the models to generate words present in the personalized lexicons while preserving the naturalness of the generated texts. Extensive experimentation demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in finely manipulating LLMs' personality traits. Furthermore, our method can be seamlessly integrated into other LLMs without necessitating updates to their parameters.

**ABSTRACT**  
In recent years, we witness the explosion of false and unconfirmed information (i.e., rumors) that went viral on social media and shocked the public. Rumors can trigger versatile, mostly controversial stance expressions among social media users. Rumor verification and stance detection are different yet relevant tasks. Fake news debunking primarily focuses on determining the truthfulness of news articles, which oversimplifies the issue as fake news often combines elements of both truth and falsehood. Thus, it becomes crucial to identify specific instances of misinformation within the articles. In this research, we investigate a novel task in the field of fake news debunking, which involves detecting sentence-level misinformation. One of the major challenges in this task is the absence of a training dataset with sentence-level annotations regarding veracity. Inspired by the Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) approach, we propose a model called Weakly Supervised Detection of Misinforming Sentences (WSDMS). This model only requires bag-level labels for training but is capable of inferring both sentence-level misinformation and article-level veracity, aided by relevant social media conversations that are attentively contextualized with news sentences. We evaluate WSDMS on three real-world benchmarks and demonstrate that it outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines in debunking fake news at both the sentence and article levels.

**ABSTRACT**  
Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) are trained on vast unlabeled data, rich in world knowledge. This fact has sparked the interest of the community in quantifying the amount of factual knowledge present in PLMs, as this explains their performance on downstream tasks, and potentially justifies their use as knowledge bases. In this work, we survey methods and datasets that are used to probe PLMs for factual knowledge. Our contributions are: (1) We propose a categorization scheme for factual probing methods that is based on how their inputs, outputs and the probed PLMs are adapted; (2) We provide an overview of the datasets used for factual probing; (3) We synthesize insights about knowledge retention and prompt optimization in PLMs, analyze obstacles to adopting PLMs as knowledge bases and outline directions for future work.

**ABSTRACT**  
We present 1-Pager the first system that answers a question and retrieves evidence using a single Transformer-based model and decoding process. 1-Pager incrementally partitions the retrieval corpus using constrained decoding to select a document and answer string, and we show that this is competitive with comparable retrieve-and-read alternatives according to both retrieval and answer accuracy metrics. 1-Pager also outperforms the equivalent closed-book question answering model, by grounding predictions in an evidence corpus. While 1-Pager is not yet on-par with more expensive systems that read many more documents before generating an answer, we argue that it provides an important step toward attributed generation by folding retrieval into the sequence-to-sequence paradigm that is currently dominant in NLP. We also show that the search paths used to partition the corpus are easy to read and understand, paving a way forward for interpretable neural retrieval.

**ABSTRACT**  
With the help of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance on various reasoning tasks. However, most of them have been evaluated under noise-free context and the dilemma for LLMs to produce inaccurate results under the noisy context has not been fully investigated. Existing studies utilize trigger sentences to encourage LLMs to concentrate on the relevant information but the trigger has limited effect on final answer prediction. Inspired by interactive CoT method, where intermediate reasoning steps are promoted by multiple rounds of interaction between users and LLMs, we propose a novel prompting method, namely R$^3$ prompting, for CoT reasoning under noisy context. Specifically, R$^3$ prompting interacts with LLMs to perform key sentence extraction, variable declaration and answer prediction, which corresponds to a thought process of reviewing, rephrasing and resolving. The responses generated at the last interaction will perform as hints to guide toward the responses of the next interaction. Our experiments show that R$^3$ prompting significantly outperforms existing CoT prompting methods on five reasoning tasks under noisy context. With GPT-3.5-turbo, we observe 3.7% accuracy improvement on average on the reasoning tasks under noisy context compared to the most competitive prompting baseline. More analyses and ablation studies show the robustness and generalization of R$^3$ prompting method in solving reasoning tasks in LLMs under noisy context.

In this paper, we evaluate different abilities of GPT-4V including visual understanding, language understanding, visual puzzle solving, and understanding of other modalities such as depth, thermal, video, and audio. To estimate GPT-4V's performance, we manually construct 656 test instances and carefully evaluate the results of GPT-4V. The highlights of our findings are as follows: (1) GPT-4V exhibits impressive performance on English visual-centric benchmarks but fails to recognize simple Chinese texts in the images; (2) GPT-4V shows inconsistent refusal behavior when answering questions related to sensitive traits such as gender, race, and age; (3) GPT-4V obtains worse results than GPT-4 (API) on language understanding tasks including general language understanding benchmarks and visual commonsense knowledge evaluation benchmarks; (4) Few-shot prompting can improve GPT-4V's performance on both visual understanding and language understanding; (5) GPT-4V struggles to find the nuances between two similar images and solve the easy math picture puzzles; (6) GPT-4V shows non-trivial performance on the tasks of similar modalities to image, such as video and thermal. Our experimental results reveal the ability and limitations of GPT-4V and we hope our paper can provide some insights into the application and research of GPT-4V.

**ABSTRACT**  
We present the Charles University system for the MRL~2023 Shared Task on Multi-lingual Multi-task Information Retrieval. The goal of the shared task was to develop systems for named entity recognition and question answering in several under-represented languages. Our solutions to both subtasks rely on the translate-test approach. We first translate the unlabeled examples into English using a multilingual machine translation model. Then, we run inference on the translated data using a strong task-specific model. Finally, we project the labeled data back into the original language. To keep the inferred tags on the correct positions in the original language, we propose a method based on scoring the candidate positions using a label-sensitive translation model. In both settings, we experiment with finetuning the classification models on the translated data. However, due to a domain mismatch between the development data and the shared task validation and test sets, the finetuned models could not outperform our baselines.

**ABSTRACT**  
A crucial challenge for generative large language models (LLMs) is diversity: when a user's prompt is under-specified, models may follow implicit assumptions while generating a response, which may result in homogenization of the responses, as well as certain demographic groups being under-represented or even erased from the generated responses. In this paper, we formalize diversity of representation in generative LLMs. We present evaluation datasets and propose metrics to measure diversity in generated responses along people and culture axes. We find that LLMs understand the notion of diversity, and that they can reason and critique their own responses for that goal. This finding motivated a new prompting technique called collective-critique and self-voting (CCSV) to self-improve people diversity of LLMs by tapping into its diversity reasoning capabilities, without relying on handcrafted examples or prompt tuning. Extensive empirical experiments with both human and automated evaluations show that our proposed approach is effective at improving people and culture diversity, and outperforms all baseline methods by a large margin.

**ABSTRACT**  
The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized natural language processing tasks. However, existing instruction-tuning datasets suffer from occupational bias: the majority of data relates to only a few occupations, which hampers the instruction-tuned LLMs to generate helpful responses to professional queries from practitioners in specific fields. To mitigate this issue and promote occupation-inclusive LLMs, we create an instruction-tuning dataset named \emph{OccuQuest}, which contains 110,000+ prompt-completion pairs and 30,000+ dialogues covering over 1,000 occupations in 26 occupational categories. We systematically request ChatGPT, organizing queries hierarchically based on Occupation, Responsibility, Topic, and Question, to ensure a comprehensive coverage of occupational specialty inquiries. By comparing with three commonly used datasets (Dolly, ShareGPT, and WizardLM), we observe that OccuQuest exhibits a more balanced distribution across occupations. Furthermore, we assemble three test sets for comprehensive evaluation, an occu-test set covering 25 occupational categories, an estate set focusing on real estate, and an occu-quora set containing real-world questions from Quora. We then fine-tune LLaMA on OccuQuest to obtain OccuLLaMA, which significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLaMA variants (Vicuna, Tulu, and WizardLM) on professional questions in GPT-4 and human evaluations. Notably, on the occu-quora set, OccuLLaMA reaches a high win rate of 86.4\% against WizardLM.

**ABSTRACT**  
Representational spaces learned via language modeling are fundamental to Natural Language Processing (NLP), however there has been limited understanding regarding how and when during training various types of linguistic information emerge and interact. Leveraging a novel information theoretic probing suite, which enables direct comparisons of not just task performance, but their representational subspaces, we analyze nine tasks covering syntax, semantics and reasoning, across 2M pre-training steps and five seeds. We identify critical learning phases across tasks and time, during which subspaces emerge, share information, and later disentangle to specialize. Across these phases, syntactic knowledge is acquired rapidly after 0.5% of full training. Continued performance improvements primarily stem from the acquisition of open-domain knowledge, while semantics and reasoning tasks benefit from later boosts to long-range contextualization and higher specialization. Measuring cross-task similarity further reveals that linguistically related tasks share information throughout training, and do so more during the critical phase of learning than before or after.

**ABSTRACT**  
Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) are pioneering advances in many natural language processing tasks, however, their exceptional capabilities are restricted within the preset context window of Transformer. Position Embedding (PE) scaling methods, while effective in extending the context window to a specific length, demonstrate either notable limitations in their extrapolation abilities or sacrificing partial performance within the context window. Length extrapolation methods, although theoretically capable of extending the context window beyond the training sequence length, often underperform in practical long-context applications. To address these challenges, we propose Continuous Length EXtrapolation (CLEX) for LLMs. We generalise the PE scaling approaches to model the continuous dynamics by ordinary differential equations over the length scaling factor, thereby overcoming the constraints of current PE scaling methods designed for specific lengths. Moreover, by extending the dynamics to desired context lengths beyond the training sequence length, CLEX facilitates the length extrapolation with impressive performance in practical tasks. We demonstrate that CLEX can be seamlessly incorporated into LLMs equipped with Rotary Position Embedding, such as LLaMA and GPT-NeoX, with negligible impact on training and inference latency. Experimental results reveal that CLEX can effectively extend the context window to over 4x or almost 8x training length, with no deterioration in performance. Furthermore, when evaluated on the practical LongBench benchmark, our model trained on a 4k length exhibits competitive performance against state-of-the-art open-source models trained on context lengths up to 32k.

**ABSTRACT**  
Question generation (QG) from a given context can enhance comprehension, engagement, assessment, and overall efficacy in learning or conversational environments. Despite recent advancements in QG, the challenge of enhancing or measuring the diversity of generated questions often remains unaddressed. In this paper, we introduce a multi-question generation model (mQG), which is capable of generating multiple, diverse, and answerable questions by focusing on context and questions. To validate the answerability of the generated questions, we employ a SQuAD2.0 fine-tuned question answering model, classifying the questions as answerable or not. We train and evaluate mQG on the FairytaleQA dataset, a well-structured QA dataset based on storybooks, with narrative questions. We further apply a zero-shot adaptation on the TellMeWhy and SQuAD1.1 datasets. mQG shows promising results across various evaluation metrics, among strong baselines.

**ABSTRACT**  
Highly effective, task-specific prompts are often heavily engineered by experts to integrate detailed instructions and domain insights based on a deep understanding of both instincts of large language models (LLMs) and the intricacies of the target task. However, automating the generation of such expert-level prompts remains elusive. Existing prompt optimization methods tend to overlook the depth of domain knowledge and struggle to efficiently explore the vast space of expert-level prompts. Addressing this, we present PromptAgent, an optimization method that autonomously crafts prompts equivalent in quality to those handcrafted by experts. At its core, PromptAgent views prompt optimization as a strategic planning problem and employs a principled planning algorithm, rooted in Monte Carlo tree search, to strategically navigate the expert-level prompt space. Inspired by human-like trial-and-error exploration, PromptAgent induces precise expert-level insights and in-depth instructions by reflecting on model errors and generating constructive error feedback. Such a novel framework allows the agent to iteratively examine intermediate prompts (states), refine them based on error feedbacks (actions), simulate future rewards, and search for high-reward paths leading to expert prompts. We apply PromptAgent to 12 tasks spanning three practical domains: BIG-Bench Hard (BBH), as well as domain-specific and general NLP tasks, showing it significantly outperforms strong Chain-of-Thought and recent prompt optimization baselines. Extensive analyses emphasize its capability to craft expert-level, detailed, and domain-insightful prompts with great efficiency and generalizability.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recent years have seen remarkable advances in the field of Simultaneous Machine Translation (SiMT) due to the introduction of innovative policies that dictate whether to READ or WRITE at each step of the translation process. However, a common assumption in many existing studies is that operations are carried out at the subword level, even though the standard unit for input and output in most practical scenarios is typically at the word level. This paper demonstrates that policies devised and validated at the subword level are surpassed by those operating at the word level, which process multiple subwords to form a complete word in a single step. Additionally, we suggest a method to boost SiMT models using language models (LMs), wherein the proposed word-level policy plays a vital role in addressing the subword disparity between LMs and SiMT models. Code is available at https://github.com/xl8-ai/WordSiMT.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper investigates the problem-solving capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by evaluating their performance on stumpers, unique single-step intuition problems that pose challenges for human solvers but are easily verifiable. We compare the performance of four state-of-the-art LLMs (Davinci-2, Davinci-3, GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4) to human participants. Our findings reveal that the new-generation LLMs excel in solving stumpers and surpass human performance. However, humans exhibit superior skills in verifying solutions to the same problems. This research enhances our understanding of LLMs' cognitive abilities and provides insights for enhancing their problem-solving potential across various domains.

**ABSTRACT**  
We tackle the problem of zero-shot cross-lingual transfer in NLP tasks via the use of language adapters (LAs). Most of the earlier works have explored training with adapter of a single source (often English), and testing either using the target LA or LA of another related language. Training target LA requires unlabeled data, which may not be readily available for low resource unseen languages: those that are neither seen by the underlying multilingual language model (e.g., mBERT), nor do we have any (labeled or unlabeled) data for them. We posit that for more effective cross-lingual transfer, instead of just one source LA, we need to leverage LAs of multiple (linguistically or geographically related) source languages, both at train and test-time - which we investigate via our novel neural architecture, ZGUL. Extensive experimentation across four language groups, covering 15 unseen target languages, demonstrates improvements of up to 3.2 average F1 points over standard fine-tuning and other strong baselines on POS tagging and NER tasks. We also extend ZGUL to settings where either (1) some unlabeled data or (2) few-shot training examples are available for the target language. We find that ZGUL continues to outperform baselines in these settings too.

**ABSTRACT**  
It has been known to be difficult to generate adequate sports updates from a sequence of vast amounts of diverse live tweets, although the live sports viewing experience with tweets is gaining the popularity. In this paper, we focus on soccer matches and work on building a system to generate live updates for soccer matches from tweets so that users can instantly grasp a match's progress and enjoy the excitement of the match from raw tweets. Our proposed system is based on a large pre-trained language model and incorporates a mechanism to control the number of updates and a mechanism to reduce the redundancy of duplicate and similar updates.

**ABSTRACT**  
E-commerce product catalogs contain billions of items. Most products have lengthy titles, as sellers pack them with product attributes to improve retrieval, and highlight key product aspects. This results in a gap between such unnatural products titles, and how customers refer to them. It also limits how e-commerce stores can use these seller-provided titles for recommendation, QA, or review summarization.   Inspired by recent work on instruction-tuned LLMs, we present InstructPTS, a controllable approach for the task of Product Title Summarization (PTS). Trained using a novel instruction fine-tuning strategy, our approach is able to summarize product titles according to various criteria (e.g. number of words in a summary, inclusion of specific phrases, etc.). Extensive evaluation on a real-world e-commerce catalog shows that compared to simple fine-tuning of LLMs, our proposed approach can generate more accurate product name summaries, with an improvement of over 14 and 8 BLEU and ROUGE points, respectively.

**ABSTRACT**  
Document image classification is different from plain-text document classification and consists of classifying a document by understanding the content and structure of documents such as forms, emails, and other such documents. We show that the only existing dataset for this task (Lewis et al., 2006) has several limitations and we introduce two newly curated multilingual datasets WIKI-DOC and MULTIEURLEX-DOC that overcome these limitations. We further undertake a comprehensive study of popular visually-rich document understanding or Document AI models in previously untested setting in document image classification such as 1) multi-label classification, and 2) zero-shot cross-lingual transfer setup. Experimental results show limitations of multilingual Document AI models on cross-lingual transfer across typologically distant languages. Our datasets and findings open the door for future research into improving Document AI models.

**ABSTRACT**  
Advancements in natural language generation (NLG) and large language models (LLMs) have led to proficient text generation in various tasks. However, integrating intricate constraints into neural text generation, due to LLMs' opacity, remains challenging. This study investigates constrained text generation for LLMs, where predefined constraints are applied during LLM's generation process. Our research examines multiple LLMs, including ChatGPT and GPT-4, categorizing constraints into lexical, structural, and relation-based types. We also present various benchmarks to facilitate fair evaluation. The study addresses some key research questions, including the extent of LLMs' compliance with constraints. Results illuminate LLMs' capacity and deficiency to incorporate constraints and provide insights for future developments in constrained text generation. Codes and datasets will be released upon acceptance.

**ABSTRACT**  
Coherence is a linguistic term that refers to the relations between small textual units (sentences, propositions), which make the text logically consistent and meaningful to the reader. With the advances of generative foundational models in NLP, there is a pressing need to automatically assess the human-perceived coherence of automatically generated texts. Up until now, little work has been done on explicitly assessing the coherence of generated texts and analyzing the factors contributing to (in)coherence. Previous work on the topic used other tasks, e.g., sentence reordering, as proxies of coherence, rather than approaching coherence detection heads on. In this paper, we introduce {\sc CoheSentia}, a novel benchmark of human-perceived coherence of automatically generated texts. Our annotation protocol reflects two perspectives; one is global, assigning a single coherence score, and the other is incremental, scoring sentence by sentence. The incremental method produces an (in)coherence score for each text fragment and also pinpoints reasons for incoherence at that point. Our benchmark contains 500 automatically-generated and human-annotated paragraphs, each annotated in both methods, by multiple raters. Our analysis shows that the inter-annotator agreement in the incremental mode is higher than in the holistic alternative, and our experiments show that standard LMs fine-tuned for coherence detection show varied performance on the different factors contributing to (in)coherence. All in all, these models yield unsatisfactory performance, emphasizing the need for developing more reliable methods for coherence assessment.

**ABSTRACT**  
Dialogue assessment plays a critical role in the development of open-domain dialogue systems. Existing work are uncapable of providing an end-to-end and human-epistemic assessment dataset, while they only provide sub-metrics like coherence or the dialogues are conversed between annotators far from real user settings. In this paper, we release a large-scale dialogue quality assessment dataset (DiQAD), for automatically assessing open-domain dialogue quality. Specifically, we (1) establish the assessment criteria based on the dimensions conforming to human judgements on dialogue qualities, and (2) annotate large-scale dialogues that conversed between real users based on these annotation criteria, which contains around 100,000 dialogues. We conduct several experiments and report the performances of the baselines as the benchmark on DiQAD. The dataset is openly accessible at https://github.com/yukunZhao/Dataset_Dialogue_quality_evaluation.

**ABSTRACT**  
Understanding and representing webpages is crucial to online social networks where users may share and engage with URLs. Common language model (LM) encoders such as BERT can be used to understand and represent the textual content of webpages. However, these representations may not model thematic information of web domains and URLs or accurately capture their appeal to social media users. In this work, we introduce a new pre-training objective that can be used to adapt LMs to understand URLs and webpages. Our proposed framework consists of two steps: (1) scalable graph embeddings to learn shallow representations of URLs based on user engagement on social media and (2) a contrastive objective that aligns LM representations with the aforementioned graph-based representation. We apply our framework to the multilingual version of BERT to obtain the model URL-BERT. We experimentally demonstrate that our continued pre-training approach improves webpage understanding on a variety of tasks and Twitter internal and external benchmarks.

**ABSTRACT**  
Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as influential instruments within the realm of natural language processing; nevertheless, their capacity to handle multi-party conversations (MPCs) -- a scenario marked by the presence of multiple interlocutors involved in intricate information exchanges -- remains uncharted. In this paper, we delve into the potential of generative LLMs such as ChatGPT and GPT-4 within the context of MPCs. An empirical analysis is conducted to assess the zero-shot learning capabilities of ChatGPT and GPT-4 by subjecting them to evaluation across three MPC datasets that encompass five representative tasks. The findings reveal that ChatGPT's performance on a number of evaluated MPC tasks leaves much to be desired, whilst GPT-4's results portend a promising future. Additionally, we endeavor to bolster performance through the incorporation of MPC structures, encompassing both speaker and addressee architecture. This study provides an exhaustive evaluation and analysis of applying generative LLMs to MPCs, casting a light upon the conception and creation of increasingly effective and robust MPC agents. Concurrently, this work underscores the challenges implicit in the utilization of LLMs for MPCs, such as deciphering graphical information flows and generating stylistically consistent responses.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper introduces the Cross-lingual Fact Extraction and VERification (XFEVER) dataset designed for benchmarking the fact verification models across different languages. We constructed it by translating the claim and evidence texts of the Fact Extraction and VERification (FEVER) dataset into six languages. The training and development sets were translated using machine translation, whereas the test set includes texts translated by professional translators and machine-translated texts. Using the XFEVER dataset, two cross-lingual fact verification scenarios, zero-shot learning and translate-train learning, are defined, and baseline models for each scenario are also proposed in this paper. Experimental results show that the multilingual language model can be used to build fact verification models in different languages efficiently. However, the performance varies by language and is somewhat inferior to the English case. We also found that we can effectively mitigate model miscalibration by considering the prediction similarity between the English and target languages. The XFEVER dataset, code, and model checkpoints are available at https://github.com/nii-yamagishilab/xfever.

**ABSTRACT**  
Language models trained on large-scale corpus often generate content that is harmful, toxic, or contrary to human preferences, making their alignment with human values a critical concern. Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) with algorithms like PPO is a prevalent approach for alignment but is often complex, unstable, and resource-intensive. Recently, ranking-based alignment methods have emerged, offering stability and effectiveness by replacing the RL framework with supervised fine-tuning, but they are costly due to the need for annotated data. Considering that existing large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT are already relatively well-aligned and cost-friendly, researchers have begun to align the language model with human preference from AI feedback. The common practices, which unidirectionally distill the instruction-following responses from LLMs, are constrained by their bottleneck. Thus we introduce CycleAlign to distill alignment capabilities from parameter-invisible LLMs (black-box) to a parameter-visible model (white-box) in an iterative manner. With in-context learning (ICL) as the core of the cycle, the black-box models are able to rank the model-generated responses guided by human-craft instruction and demonstrations about their preferences. During iterative interaction, the white-box models also have a judgment about responses generated by them. Consequently, the agreement ranking could be viewed as a pseudo label to dynamically update the in-context demonstrations and improve the preference ranking ability of black-box models. Through multiple interactions, the CycleAlign framework could align the white-box model with the black-box model effectively in a low-resource way. Empirical results illustrate that the model fine-tuned by CycleAlign remarkably exceeds existing methods, and achieves the state-of-the-art performance in alignment with human value.

**ABSTRACT**  
Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) are the state-of-the-art for natural language tasks. Recent work has attempted to decode, by reverse engineering the role of linear layers, the internal mechanisms by which LLMs arrive at their final predictions for text completion tasks. Yet little is known about the specific role of attention heads in producing the final token prediction. We propose Attention Lens, a tool that enables researchers to translate the outputs of attention heads into vocabulary tokens via learned attention-head-specific transformations called lenses. Preliminary findings from our trained lenses indicate that attention heads play highly specialized roles in language models. The code for Attention Lens is available at github.com/msakarvadia/AttentionLens.

**ABSTRACT**  
Neutrality is difficult to achieve and, in politics, subjective. Traditional media typically adopt an editorial line that can be used by their potential readers as an indicator of the media bias. Several platforms currently rate news outlets according to their political bias. The editorial line and the ratings help readers in gathering a balanced view of news. But in the advent of instruction-following language models, tasks such as writing a newspaper article can be delegated to computers. Without imposing a biased persona, where would an AI-based news outlet lie within the bias ratings? In this work, we use the ratings of authentic news outlets to create a multilingual corpus of news with coarse stance annotations (Left and Right) along with automatically extracted topic annotations. We show that classifiers trained on this data are able to identify the editorial line of most unseen newspapers in English, German, Spanish and Catalan. We then apply the classifiers to 101 newspaper-like articles written by ChatGPT and Bard in the 4 languages at different time periods. We observe that, similarly to traditional newspapers, ChatGPT editorial line evolves with time and, being a data-driven system, the stance of the generated articles differs among languages.

**ABSTRACT**  
We analyze the masked language modeling pretraining objective function from the perspective of the distributional hypothesis. We investigate whether better sample efficiency and the better generalization capability of models pretrained with masked language modeling can be attributed to the semantic similarity encoded in the pretraining data's distributional property. Via a synthetic dataset, our analysis suggests that distributional property indeed leads to the better sample efficiency of pretrained masked language models, but does not fully explain the generalization capability. We also conduct analyses over two real-world datasets and demonstrate that the distributional property does not explain the generalization ability of pretrained natural language models either. Our results illustrate our limited understanding of model pretraining and provide future research directions.

**ABSTRACT**  
Visual question answering (VQA) has traditionally been treated as a single-step task where each question receives the same amount of effort, unlike natural human question-answering strategies. We explore a question decomposition strategy for VQA to overcome this limitation. We probe the ability of recently developed large vision-language models to use human-written decompositions and produce their own decompositions of visual questions, finding they are capable of learning both tasks from demonstrations alone. However, we show that naive application of model-written decompositions can hurt performance. We introduce a model-driven selective decomposition approach for second-guessing predictions and correcting errors, and validate its effectiveness on eight VQA tasks across three domains, showing consistent improvements in accuracy, including improvements of >20% on medical VQA datasets and boosting the zero-shot performance of BLIP-2 above chance on a VQA reformulation of the challenging Winoground task.

**ABSTRACT**  
Deep learning-based solutions for semantic segmentation suffer from significant performance degradation when tested on data with different characteristics than what was used during the training. Adapting the models using annotated data from the new domain is not always practical. Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) approaches are crucial in deploying these models in the actual operating conditions. Recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) UDA methods employ a teacher-student self-training approach, where a teacher model is used to generate pseudo-labels for the new data which in turn guide the training process of the student model. Though this approach has seen a lot of success, it suffers from the issue of noisy pseudo-labels being propagated in the training process. To address this issue, we propose an auxiliary pseudo-label refinement network (PRN) for online refining of the pseudo labels and also localizing the pixels whose predicted labels are likely to be noisy. Being able to improve the quality of pseudo labels and select highly reliable ones, PRN helps self-training of segmentation models to be robust against pseudo label noise propagation during different stages of adaptation. We evaluate our approach on benchmark datasets with three different domain shifts, and our approach consistently performs significantly better than the previous state-of-the-art methods.

**ABSTRACT**  
Due to the high price and heavy energy consumption of GPUs, deploying deep models on IoT devices such as microcontrollers makes significant contributions for ecological AI. Conventional methods successfully enable convolutional neural network inference of high resolution images on microcontrollers, while the framework for vision transformers that achieve the state-of-the-art performance in many vision applications still remains unexplored. In this paper, we propose a hardware-algorithm co-optimizations method called MCUFormer to deploy vision transformers on microcontrollers with extremely limited memory, where we jointly design transformer architecture and construct the inference operator library to fit the memory resource constraint. More specifically, we generalize the one-shot network architecture search (NAS) to discover the optimal architecture with highest task performance given the memory budget from the microcontrollers, where we enlarge the existing search space of vision transformers by considering the low-rank decomposition dimensions and patch resolution for memory reduction. For the construction of the inference operator library of vision transformers, we schedule the memory buffer during inference through operator integration, patch embedding decomposition, and token overwriting, allowing the memory buffer to be fully utilized to adapt to the forward pass of the vision transformer. Experimental results demonstrate that our MCUFormer achieves 73.62\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet for image classification with 320KB memory on STM32F746 microcontroller.

**ABSTRACT**  
The use of pretrained deep neural networks represents an attractive way to achieve strong results with few data available. When specialized in dense problems such as object detection, learning local rather than global information in images has proven to be more efficient. However, for unsupervised pretraining, the popular contrastive learning requires a large batch size and, therefore, a lot of resources. To address this problem, we are interested in transformer-based object detectors that have recently gained traction in the community with good performance and with the particularity of generating many diverse object proposals.   In this work, we present Proposal Selection Contrast (ProSeCo), a novel unsupervised overall pretraining approach that leverages this property. ProSeCo uses the large number of object proposals generated by the detector for contrastive learning, which allows the use of a smaller batch size, combined with object-level features to learn local information in the images. To improve the effectiveness of the contrastive loss, we introduce the object location information in the selection of positive examples to take into account multiple overlapping object proposals. When reusing pretrained backbone, we advocate for consistency in learning local information between the backbone and the detection head.   We show that our method outperforms state of the art in unsupervised pretraining for object detection on standard and novel benchmarks in learning with fewer data.

**ABSTRACT**  
We assemble a dataset of Creative-Commons-licensed (CC) images, which we use to train a set of open diffusion models that are qualitatively competitive with Stable Diffusion 2 (SD2). This task presents two challenges: (1) high-resolution CC images lack the captions necessary to train text-to-image generative models; (2) CC images are relatively scarce. In turn, to address these challenges, we use an intuitive transfer learning technique to produce a set of high-quality synthetic captions paired with curated CC images. We then develop a data- and compute-efficient training recipe that requires as little as 3% of the LAION-2B data needed to train existing SD2 models, but obtains comparable quality. These results indicate that we have a sufficient number of CC images (~70 million) for training high-quality models. Our training recipe also implements a variety of optimizations that achieve ~3X training speed-ups, enabling rapid model iteration. We leverage this recipe to train several high-quality text-to-image models, which we dub the CommonCanvas family. Our largest model achieves comparable performance to SD2 on a human evaluation, despite being trained on our CC dataset that is significantly smaller than LAION and using synthetic captions for training. We release our models, data, and code at https://github.com/mosaicml/diffusion/blob/main/assets/common-canvas.md

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capabilities of the recently released GPT-4V(ision), a Large Multimodal Model (LMM). We assess the model's performance across a range of OCR tasks, including scene text recognition, handwritten text recognition, handwritten mathematical expression recognition, table structure recognition, and information extraction from visually-rich document. The evaluation reveals that GPT-4V performs well in recognizing and understanding Latin contents, but struggles with multilingual scenarios and complex tasks. Based on these observations, we delve deeper into the necessity of specialized OCR models and deliberate on the strategies to fully harness the pretrained general LMMs like GPT-4V for OCR downstream tasks. The study offers a critical reference for future research in OCR with LMMs. Evaluation pipeline and results are available at https://github.com/SCUT-DLVCLab/GPT-4V_OCR.

**ABSTRACT**  
Biometric verification systems are deployed in various security-based access-control applications that require user-friendly and reliable person verification. Among the different biometric characteristics, fingervein biometrics have been extensively studied owing to their reliable verification performance. Furthermore, fingervein patterns reside inside the skin and are not visible outside; therefore, they possess inherent resistance to presentation attacks and degradation due to external factors. In this paper, we introduce a novel fingervein verification technique using a convolutional multihead attention network called VeinAtnNet. The proposed VeinAtnNet is designed to achieve light weight with a smaller number of learnable parameters while extracting discriminant information from both normal and enhanced fingervein images. The proposed VeinAtnNet was trained on the newly constructed fingervein dataset with 300 unique fingervein patterns that were captured in multiple sessions to obtain 92 samples per unique fingervein. Extensive experiments were performed on the newly collected dataset FV-300 and the publicly available FV-USM and FV-PolyU fingervein dataset. The performance of the proposed method was compared with five state-of-the-art fingervein verification systems, indicating the efficacy of the proposed VeinAtnNet.

**ABSTRACT**  
Deep-learning models have been successful in biomedical image segmentation. To generalize for real-world deployment, test-time augmentation (TTA) methods are often used to transform the test image into different versions that are hopefully closer to the training domain. Unfortunately, due to the vast diversity of instance scale and image styles, many augmented test images produce undesirable results, thus lowering the overall performance. This work proposes a new TTA framework, S$^3$-TTA, which selects the suitable image scale and style for each test image based on a transformation consistency metric. In addition, S$^3$-TTA constructs an end-to-end augmentation-segmentation joint-training pipeline to ensure a task-oriented augmentation. On public benchmarks for cell and lung segmentation, S$^3$-TTA demonstrates improvements over the prior art by 3.4% and 1.3%, respectively, by simply augmenting the input data in testing phase.

**ABSTRACT**  
Although the mapping between sound and meaning in human language is assumed to be largely arbitrary, research in cognitive science has shown that there are non-trivial correlations between particular sounds and meanings across languages and demographic groups, a phenomenon known as sound symbolism. Among the many dimensions of meaning, sound symbolism is particularly salient and well-demonstrated with regards to cross-modal associations between language and the visual domain. In this work, we address the question of whether sound symbolism is reflected in vision-and-language models such as CLIP and Stable Diffusion. Using zero-shot knowledge probing to investigate the inherent knowledge of these models, we find strong evidence that they do show this pattern, paralleling the well-known kiki-bouba effect in psycholinguistics. Our work provides a novel method for demonstrating sound symbolism and understanding its nature using computational tools. Our code will be made publicly available.

**ABSTRACT**  
Many researchers believe that ConvNets perform well on small or moderately sized datasets, but are not competitive with Vision Transformers when given access to datasets on the web-scale. We challenge this belief by evaluating a performant ConvNet architecture pre-trained on JFT-4B, a large labelled dataset of images often used for training foundation models. We consider pre-training compute budgets between 0.4k and 110k TPU-v4 core compute hours, and train a series of networks of increasing depth and width from the NFNet model family. We observe a log-log scaling law between held out loss and compute budget. After fine-tuning on ImageNet, NFNets match the reported performance of Vision Transformers with comparable compute budgets. Our strongest fine-tuned model achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 90.4%.

**ABSTRACT**  
In the context of Audio Visual Question Answering (AVQA) tasks, the audio visual modalities could be learnt on three levels: 1) Spatial, 2) Temporal, and 3) Semantic. Existing AVQA methods suffer from two major shortcomings; the audio-visual (AV) information passing through the network isn't aligned on Spatial and Temporal levels; and, inter-modal (audio and visual) Semantic information is often not balanced within a context; this results in poor performance. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end Contextual Multi-modal Alignment (CAD) network that addresses the challenges in AVQA methods by i) introducing a parameter-free stochastic Contextual block that ensures robust audio and visual alignment on the Spatial level; ii) proposing a pre-training technique for dynamic audio and visual alignment on Temporal level in a self-supervised setting, and iii) introducing a cross-attention mechanism to balance audio and visual information on Semantic level. The proposed novel CAD network improves the overall performance over the state-of-the-art methods on average by 9.4% on the MUSIC-AVQA dataset. We also demonstrate that our proposed contributions to AVQA can be added to the existing methods to improve their performance without additional complexity requirements.

**ABSTRACT**  
In recent years, digital humans have been widely applied in augmented/virtual reality (A/VR), where viewers are allowed to freely observe and interact with the volumetric content. However, the digital humans may be degraded with various distortions during the procedure of generation and transmission. Moreover, little effort has been put into the perceptual quality assessment of digital humans. Therefore, it is urgent to carry out objective quality assessment methods to tackle the challenge of digital human quality assessment (DHQA). In this paper, we develop a novel no-reference (NR) method based on Transformer to deal with DHQA in a multi-task manner. Specifically, the front 2D projections of the digital humans are rendered as inputs and the vision transformer (ViT) is employed for the feature extraction. Then we design a multi-task module to jointly classify the distortion types and predict the perceptual quality levels of digital humans. The experimental results show that the proposed method well correlates with the subjective ratings and outperforms the state-of-the-art quality assessment methods.

**ABSTRACT**  
Accurate measurement of the offset from roof-to-footprint in very-high-resolution remote sensing imagery is crucial for urban information extraction tasks. With the help of deep learning, existing methods typically rely on two-stage CNN models to extract regions of interest on building feature maps. At the first stage, a Region Proposal Network (RPN) is applied to extract thousands of ROIs (Region of Interests) which will post-imported into a Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNN) to extract wanted information. However, because of inflexible RPN, these methods often lack effective user interaction, encounter difficulties in instance correspondence, and struggle to keep up with the advancements in general artificial intelligence. This paper introduces an interactive Transformer model combined with a prompt encoder to precisely extract building segmentation as well as the offset vectors from roofs to footprints. In our model, a powerful module, namely ROAM, was tailored for common problems in predicting roof-to-footprint offsets. We tested our model's feasibility on the publicly available BONAI dataset, achieving a significant reduction in Prompt-Instance-Level offset errors ranging from 14.6% to 16.3%. Additionally, we developed a Distance-NMS algorithm tailored for large-scale building offsets, significantly enhancing the accuracy of predicted building offset angles and lengths in a straightforward and efficient manner. To further validate the model's robustness, we created a new test set using 0.5m remote sensing imagery from Huizhou, China, for inference testing. Our code, training methods, and the updated dataset will be accessable at https://github.com/likaiucas.

**ABSTRACT**  
Deriving reliable region-word alignment from image-text pairs is critical to learn object-level vision-language representations for open-vocabulary object detection. Existing methods typically rely on pre-trained or self-trained vision-language models for alignment, which are prone to limitations in localization accuracy or generalization capabilities. In this paper, we propose CoDet, a novel approach that overcomes the reliance on pre-aligned vision-language space by reformulating region-word alignment as a co-occurring object discovery problem. Intuitively, by grouping images that mention a shared concept in their captions, objects corresponding to the shared concept shall exhibit high co-occurrence among the group. CoDet then leverages visual similarities to discover the co-occurring objects and align them with the shared concept. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CoDet has superior performances and compelling scalability in open-vocabulary detection, e.g., by scaling up the visual backbone, CoDet achieves 37.0 $\text{AP}^m_{novel}$ and 44.7 $\text{AP}^m_{all}$ on OV-LVIS, surpassing the previous SoTA by 4.2 $\text{AP}^m_{novel}$ and 9.8 $\text{AP}^m_{all}$.

**ABSTRACT**  
Text-to-image diffusion models achieved a remarkable leap in capabilities over the last few years, enabling high-quality and diverse synthesis of images from a textual prompt. However, even the most advanced models often struggle to precisely follow all of the directions in their prompts. The vast majority of these models are trained on datasets consisting of (image, caption) pairs where the images often come from the web, and the captions are their HTML alternate text. A notable example is the LAION dataset, used by Stable Diffusion and other models. In this work we observe that these captions are often of low quality, and argue that this significantly affects the model's capability to understand nuanced semantics in the textual prompts. We show that by relabeling the corpus with a specialized automatic captioning model and training a text-to-image model on the recaptioned dataset, the model benefits substantially across the board. First, in overall image quality: e.g. FID 14.84 vs. the baseline of 17.87, and 64.3% improvement in faithful image generation according to human evaluation. Second, in semantic alignment, e.g. semantic object accuracy 84.34 vs. 78.90, counting alignment errors 1.32 vs. 1.44 and positional alignment 62.42 vs. 57.60. We analyze various ways to relabel the corpus and provide evidence that this technique, which we call RECAP, both reduces the train-inference discrepancy and provides the model with more information per example, increasing sample efficiency and allowing the model to better understand the relations between captions and images.

**ABSTRACT**  
Facial Expression Recognition (FER) is a crucial task in affective computing, but its conventional focus on the seven basic emotions limits its applicability to the complex and expanding emotional spectrum. To address the issue of new and unseen emotions present in dynamic in-the-wild FER, we propose a novel vision-language model that utilises sample-level text descriptions (i.e. captions of the context, expressions or emotional cues) as natural language supervision, aiming to enhance the learning of rich latent representations, for zero-shot classification. To test this, we evaluate using zero-shot classification of the model trained on sample-level descriptions on four popular dynamic FER datasets. Our findings show that this approach yields significant improvements when compared to baseline methods. Specifically, for zero-shot video FER, we outperform CLIP by over 10\% in terms of Weighted Average Recall and 5\% in terms of Unweighted Average Recall on several datasets. Furthermore, we evaluate the representations obtained from the network trained using sample-level descriptions on the downstream task of mental health symptom estimation, achieving performance comparable or superior to state-of-the-art methods and strong agreement with human experts. Namely, we achieve a Pearson's Correlation Coefficient of up to 0.85 on schizophrenia symptom severity estimation, which is comparable to human experts' agreement.

**ABSTRACT**  
Panoramic Narrative Grounding (PNG) is an emerging visual grounding task that aims to segment visual objects in images based on dense narrative captions. The current state-of-the-art methods first refine the representation of phrase by aggregating the most similar $k$ image pixels, and then match the refined text representations with the pixels of the image feature map to generate segmentation results. However, simply aggregating sampled image features ignores the contextual information, which can lead to phrase-to-pixel mis-match. In this paper, we propose a novel learning framework called Deformable Attention Refined Matching Network (DRMN), whose main idea is to bring deformable attention in the iterative process of feature learning to incorporate essential context information of different scales of pixels. DRMN iteratively re-encodes pixels with the deformable attention network after updating the feature representation of the top-$k$ most similar pixels. As such, DRMN can lead to accurate yet discriminative pixel representations, purify the top-$k$ most similar pixels, and consequently alleviate the phrase-to-pixel mis-match substantially.Experimental results show that our novel design significantly improves the matching results between text phrases and image pixels. Concretely, DRMN achieves new state-of-the-art performance on the PNG benchmark with an average recall improvement 3.5%. The codes are available in: https://github.com/JaMesLiMers/DRMN.

**ABSTRACT**  
We propose $\mathbb{VD}$-$\mathbb{GR}$ - a novel visual dialog model that combines pre-trained language models (LMs) with graph neural networks (GNNs). Prior works mainly focused on one class of models at the expense of the other, thus missing out on the opportunity of combining their respective benefits. At the core of $\mathbb{VD}$-$\mathbb{GR}$ is a novel integration mechanism that alternates between spatial-temporal multi-modal GNNs and BERT layers, and that covers three distinct contributions: First, we use multi-modal GNNs to process the features of each modality (image, question, and dialog history) and exploit their local structures before performing BERT global attention. Second, we propose hub-nodes that link to all other nodes within one modality graph, allowing the model to propagate information from one GNN (modality) to the other in a cascaded manner. Third, we augment the BERT hidden states with fine-grained multi-modal GNN features before passing them to the next $\mathbb{VD}$-$\mathbb{GR}$ layer. Evaluations on VisDial v1.0, VisDial v0.9, VisDialConv, and VisPro show that $\mathbb{VD}$-$\mathbb{GR}$ achieves new state-of-the-art results across all four datasets.

**ABSTRACT**  
We present Learning to Explain (LTX), a model-agnostic framework designed for providing post-hoc explanations for vision models. The LTX framework introduces an "explainer" model that generates explanation maps, highlighting the crucial regions that justify the predictions made by the model being explained. To train the explainer, we employ a two-stage process consisting of initial pretraining followed by per-instance finetuning. During both stages of training, we utilize a unique configuration where we compare the explained model's prediction for a masked input with its original prediction for the unmasked input. This approach enables the use of a novel counterfactual objective, which aims to anticipate the model's output using masked versions of the input image. Importantly, the LTX framework is not restricted to a specific model architecture and can provide explanations for both Transformer-based and convolutional models. Through our evaluations, we demonstrate that LTX significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art in explainability across various metrics.

**ABSTRACT**  
Anti-spoofing detection has become a necessity for face recognition systems due to the security threat posed by spoofing attacks. Despite great success in traditional attacks, most deep-learning-based methods perform poorly in 3D masks, which can highly simulate real faces in appearance and structure, suffering generalizability insufficiency while focusing only on the spatial domain with single frame input. This has been mitigated by the recent introduction of a biomedical technology called rPPG (remote photoplethysmography). However, rPPG-based methods are sensitive to noisy interference and require at least one second (> 25 frames) of observation time, which induces high computational overhead. To address these challenges, we propose a novel 3D mask detection framework, called FASTEN (Flow-Attention-based Spatio-Temporal aggrEgation Network). We tailor the network for focusing more on fine-grained details in large movements, which can eliminate redundant spatio-temporal feature interference and quickly capture splicing traces of 3D masks in fewer frames. Our proposed network contains three key modules: 1) a facial optical flow network to obtain non-RGB inter-frame flow information; 2) flow attention to assign different significance to each frame; 3) spatio-temporal aggregation to aggregate high-level spatial features and temporal transition features. Through extensive experiments, FASTEN only requires five frames of input and outperforms eight competitors for both intra-dataset and cross-dataset evaluations in terms of multiple detection metrics. Moreover, FASTEN has been deployed in real-world mobile devices for practical 3D mask detection.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper introduces a deep learning model tailored for document information analysis, emphasizing document classification, entity relation extraction, and document visual question answering. The proposed model leverages transformer-based models to encode all the information present in a document image, including textual, visual, and layout information. The model is pre-trained and subsequently fine-tuned for various document image analysis tasks. The proposed model incorporates three additional tasks during the pre-training phase, including reading order identification of different layout segments in a document image, layout segments categorization as per PubLayNet, and generation of the text sequence within a given layout segment (text block). The model also incorporates a collective pre-training scheme where losses of all the tasks under consideration, including pre-training and fine-tuning tasks with all datasets, are considered. Additional encoder and decoder blocks are added to the RoBERTa network to generate results for all tasks. The proposed model achieved impressive results across all tasks, with an accuracy of 95.87% on the RVL-CDIP dataset for document classification, F1 scores of 0.9306, 0.9804, 0.9794, and 0.8742 on the FUNSD, CORD, SROIE, and Kleister-NDA datasets respectively for entity relation extraction, and an ANLS score of 0.8468 on the DocVQA dataset for visual question answering. The results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed model in understanding and interpreting complex document layouts and content, making it a promising tool for document analysis tasks.

**ABSTRACT**  
We introduce a novel architecture design that enhances expressiveness by incorporating multiple head classifiers (\ie, classification heads) instead of relying on channel expansion or additional building blocks. Our approach employs attention-based aggregation, utilizing pairwise feature similarity to enhance multiple lightweight heads with minimal resource overhead. We compute the Gramian matrices to reinforce class tokens in an attention layer for each head. This enables the heads to learn more discriminative representations, enhancing their aggregation capabilities. Furthermore, we propose a learning algorithm that encourages heads to complement each other by reducing correlation for aggregation. Our models eventually surpass state-of-the-art CNNs and ViTs regarding the accuracy-throughput trade-off on ImageNet-1K and deliver remarkable performance across various downstream tasks, such as COCO object instance segmentation, ADE20k semantic segmentation, and fine-grained visual classification datasets. The effectiveness of our framework is substantiated by practical experimental results and further underpinned by generalization error bound. We release the code publicly at: https://github.com/Lab-LVM/imagenet-models.

**ABSTRACT**  
Auditory and visual signals usually present together and correlate with each other, not only in natural environments but also in clinical settings. However, the audio-visual modelling in the latter case can be more challenging, due to the different sources of audio/video signals and the noise (both signal-level and semantic-level) in auditory signals -- usually speech. In this paper, we consider audio-visual modelling in a clinical setting, providing a solution to learn medical representations that benefit various clinical tasks, without human expert annotation. A simple yet effective multi-modal self-supervised learning framework is proposed for this purpose. The proposed approach is able to localise anatomical regions of interest during ultrasound imaging, with only speech audio as a reference. Experimental evaluations on a large-scale clinical multi-modal ultrasound video dataset show that the proposed self-supervised method learns good transferable anatomical representations that boost the performance of automated downstream clinical tasks, even outperforming fully-supervised solutions.

**ABSTRACT**  
Semi-supervised learning provides an expressive framework for exploiting unlabeled data when labels are insufficient. Previous semi-supervised learning methods typically match model predictions of different data-augmented views in a single-level interaction manner, which highly relies on the quality of pseudo-labels and results in semi-supervised learning not robust. In this paper, we propose a novel SSL method called DualMatch, in which the class prediction jointly invokes feature embedding in a dual-level interaction manner. DualMatch requires consistent regularizations for data augmentation, specifically, 1) ensuring that different augmented views are regulated with consistent class predictions, and 2) ensuring that different data of one class are regulated with similar feature embeddings. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of DualMatch. In the standard SSL setting, the proposal achieves 9% error reduction compared with SOTA methods, even in a more challenging class-imbalanced setting, the proposal can still achieve 6% error reduction.

**ABSTRACT**  
A long-standing goal of AI systems is to perform complex multimodal reasoning like humans. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have made remarkable strides in such multi-step reasoning on the language modality solely by leveraging the chain of thought (CoT) to mimic human thinking. However, the transfer of these advancements to multimodal contexts introduces heightened challenges, including but not limited to the impractical need for labor-intensive annotation and the limitations in terms of flexibility, generalizability, and explainability. To evoke CoT reasoning in multimodality, this work first conducts an in-depth analysis of these challenges posed by multimodality and presents two key insights: "keeping critical thinking" and "letting everyone do their jobs" in multimodal CoT reasoning. Furthermore, this study proposes a novel DDCoT prompting that maintains a critical attitude through negative-space prompting and incorporates multimodality into reasoning by first dividing the reasoning responsibility of LLMs into reasoning and recognition and then integrating the visual recognition capability of visual models into the joint reasoning process. The rationales generated by DDCoT not only improve the reasoning abilities of both large and small language models in zero-shot prompting and fine-tuning learning, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods but also exhibit impressive generalizability and explainability.

**ABSTRACT**  
Anomaly detection methods have demonstrated remarkable success across various applications. However, assessing their performance, particularly at the pixel-level, presents a complex challenge due to the severe imbalance that is most commonly present between normal and abnormal samples. Commonly adopted evaluation metrics designed for pixel-level detection may not effectively capture the nuanced performance variations arising from this class imbalance. In this paper, we dissect the intricacies of this challenge, underscored by visual evidence and statistical analysis, leading to delve into the need for evaluation metrics that account for the imbalance. We offer insights into more accurate metrics, using eleven leading contemporary anomaly detection methods on twenty-one anomaly detection problems. Overall, from this extensive experimental evaluation, we can conclude that Precision-Recall-based metrics can better capture relative method performance, making them more suitable for the task.

**ABSTRACT**  
Video Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) aims to localize a target object in videos based on the queried natural language. Recent improvements in video REC have been made using Transformer-based methods with learnable queries. However, we contend that this naive query design is not ideal given the open-world nature of video REC brought by text supervision. With numerous potential semantic categories, relying on only a few slow-updated queries is insufficient to characterize them. Our solution to this problem is to create dynamic queries that are conditioned on both the input video and language to model the diverse objects referred to. Specifically, we place a fixed number of learnable bounding boxes throughout the frame and use corresponding region features to provide prior information. Also, we noticed that current query features overlook the importance of cross-modal alignment. To address this, we align specific phrases in the sentence with semantically relevant visual areas, annotating them in existing video datasets (VID-Sentence and VidSTG). By incorporating these two designs, our proposed model (called ConFormer) outperforms other models on widely benchmarked datasets. For example, in the testing split of VID-Sentence dataset, ConFormer achieves 8.75% absolute improvement on Accu.@0.6 compared to the previous state-of-the-art model.

**ABSTRACT**  
4D radar is recognized for its resilience and cost-effectiveness under adverse weather conditions, thus playing a pivotal role in autonomous driving. While cameras and LiDAR are typically the primary sensors used in perception modules for autonomous vehicles, radar serves as a valuable supplementary sensor. Unlike LiDAR and cameras, radar remains unimpaired by harsh weather conditions, thereby offering a dependable alternative in challenging environments. Developing radar-based 3D object detection not only augments the competency of autonomous vehicles but also provides economic benefits. In response, we propose the Multi-View Feature Assisted Network (\textit{MVFAN}), an end-to-end, anchor-free, and single-stage framework for 4D-radar-based 3D object detection for autonomous vehicles. We tackle the issue of insufficient feature utilization by introducing a novel Position Map Generation module to enhance feature learning by reweighing foreground and background points, and their features, considering the irregular distribution of radar point clouds. Additionally, we propose a pioneering backbone, the Radar Feature Assisted backbone, explicitly crafted to fully exploit the valuable Doppler velocity and reflectivity data provided by the 4D radar sensor. Comprehensive experiments and ablation studies carried out on Astyx and VoD datasets attest to the efficacy of our framework. The incorporation of Doppler velocity and RCS reflectivity dramatically improves the detection performance for small moving objects such as pedestrians and cyclists. Consequently, our approach culminates in a highly optimized 4D-radar-based 3D object detection capability for autonomous driving systems, setting a new standard in the field.

**ABSTRACT**  
Denoising diffusion models show remarkable performances in generative tasks, and their potential applications in perception tasks are gaining interest. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework named DiffRef3D which adopts the diffusion process on 3D object detection with point clouds for the first time. Specifically, we formulate the proposal refinement stage of two-stage 3D object detectors as a conditional diffusion process. During training, DiffRef3D gradually adds noise to the residuals between proposals and target objects, then applies the noisy residuals to proposals to generate hypotheses. The refinement module utilizes these hypotheses to denoise the noisy residuals and generate accurate box predictions. In the inference phase, DiffRef3D generates initial hypotheses by sampling noise from a Gaussian distribution as residuals and refines the hypotheses through iterative steps. DiffRef3D is a versatile proposal refinement framework that consistently improves the performance of existing 3D object detection models. We demonstrate the significance of DiffRef3D through extensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark. Code will be available.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this paper, we introduce a novel generative model, Diffusion Layout Transformers without Autoencoder (Dolfin), which significantly improves the modeling capability with reduced complexity compared to existing methods. Dolfin employs a Transformer-based diffusion process to model layout generation. In addition to an efficient bi-directional (non-causal joint) sequence representation, we further propose an autoregressive diffusion model (Dolfin-AR) that is especially adept at capturing rich semantic correlations for the neighboring objects, such as alignment, size, and overlap. When evaluated against standard generative layout benchmarks, Dolfin notably improves performance across various metrics (fid, alignment, overlap, MaxIoU and DocSim scores), enhancing transparency and interoperability in the process. Moreover, Dolfin's applications extend beyond layout generation, making it suitable for modeling geometric structures, such as line segments. Our experiments present both qualitative and quantitative results to demonstrate the advantages of Dolfin.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper targets interactive object-level editing(e.g., deletion, recoloring, transformation, composition) in dynamic scenes. Recently, some methods aiming for flexible editing static scenes represented by neural radiance field (NeRF) have shown impressive synthesis quality, while similar capabilities in time-variant dynamic scenes remain limited. To solve this problem, we propose 4D-Editor, an interactive semantic-driven editing framework, allowing editing multiple objects in dynamic NeRF based on user strokes on a single frame. Our dynamic scene representation is built upon hybrid semantic feature fields so that the spatial-temporal consistency can be maintained after editing. In addition, we design recursive selection refinement that significantly boosts segmentation accuracy in a dynamic NeRF to aid the editing process. Moreover, we develop multi-view reprojection inpainting to fill holes caused by incomplete scene capture after editing. Extensive experiments and editing examples on real-world demonstrate that 4D-Editor achieves photo-realistic dynamic NeRF editing. Project page: https://patrickddj.github.io/4D-Editor

**ABSTRACT**  
Recent transformer-based approaches have demonstrated excellent performance in 3D human pose estimation. However, they have a holistic view and by encoding global relationships between all the joints, they do not capture the local dependencies precisely. In this paper, we present a novel Attention-GCNFormer (AGFormer) block that divides the number of channels by using two parallel transformer and GCNFormer streams. Our proposed GCNFormer module exploits the local relationship between adjacent joints, outputting a new representation that is complementary to the transformer output. By fusing these two representation in an adaptive way, AGFormer exhibits the ability to better learn the underlying 3D structure. By stacking multiple AGFormer blocks, we propose MotionAGFormer in four different variants, which can be chosen based on the speed-accuracy trade-off. We evaluate our model on two popular benchmark datasets: Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP. MotionAGFormer-B achieves state-of-the-art results, with P1 errors of 38.4mm and 16.2mm, respectively. Remarkably, it uses a quarter of the parameters and is three times more computationally efficient than the previous leading model on Human3.6M dataset.

**ABSTRACT**  
Estimating the 6D object pose is an essential task in many applications. Due to the lack of depth information, existing RGB-based methods are sensitive to occlusion and illumination changes. How to extract and utilize the geometry features in depth information is crucial to achieve accurate predictions. To this end, we propose TransPose, a novel 6D pose framework that exploits Transformer Encoder with geometry-aware module to develop better learning of point cloud feature representations. Specifically, we first uniformly sample point cloud and extract local geometry features with the designed local feature extractor base on graph convolution network. To improve robustness to occlusion, we adopt Transformer to perform the exchange of global information, making each local feature contains global information. Finally, we introduce geometry-aware module in Transformer Encoder, which to form an effective constrain for point cloud feature learning and makes the global information exchange more tightly coupled with point cloud tasks. Extensive experiments indicate the effectiveness of TransPose, our pose estimation pipeline achieves competitive results on three benchmark datasets.

**ABSTRACT**  
Object Re-Identification (ReID) is pivotal in computer vision, witnessing an escalating demand for adept multimodal representation learning. Current models, although promising, reveal scalability limitations with increasing modalities as they rely heavily on late fusion, which postpones the integration of specific modality insights. Addressing this, we introduce the \textbf{Gradual Fusion Transformer (GraFT)} for multimodal ReID. At its core, GraFT employs learnable fusion tokens that guide self-attention across encoders, adeptly capturing both modality-specific and object-specific features. Further bolstering its efficacy, we introduce a novel training paradigm combined with an augmented triplet loss, optimizing the ReID feature embedding space. We demonstrate these enhancements through extensive ablation studies and show that GraFT consistently surpasses established multimodal ReID benchmarks. Additionally, aiming for deployment versatility, we've integrated neural network pruning into GraFT, offering a balance between model size and performance.

**ABSTRACT**  
A good supervised embedding for a specific machine learning task is only sensitive to changes in the label of interest and is invariant to other confounding factors. We leverage the concept of repeatability from measurement theory to describe this property and propose to use the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) to evaluate the repeatability of embeddings. We then propose a novel regularizer, the ICC regularizer, as a complementary component for contrastive losses to guide deep neural networks to produce embeddings with higher repeatability. We use simulated data to explain why the ICC regularizer works better on minimizing the intra-class variance than the contrastive loss alone. We implement the ICC regularizer and apply it to three speech tasks: speaker verification, voice style conversion, and a clinical application for detecting dysphonic voice. The experimental results demonstrate that adding an ICC regularizer can improve the repeatability of learned embeddings compared to only using the contrastive loss; further, these embeddings lead to improved performance in these downstream tasks.

**ABSTRACT**  
We propose AccoMontage-3, a symbolic music automation system capable of generating multi-track, full-band accompaniment based on the input of a lead melody with chords (i.e., a lead sheet). The system contains three modular components, each modelling a vital aspect of full-band composition. The first component is a piano arranger that generates piano accompaniment for the lead sheet by transferring texture styles to the chords using latent chord-texture disentanglement and heuristic retrieval of texture donors. The second component orchestrates the piano accompaniment score into full-band arrangement according to the orchestration style encoded by individual track functions. The third component, which connects the previous two, is a prior model characterizing the global structure of orchestration style over the whole piece of music. From end to end, the system learns to generate full-band accompaniment in a self-supervised fashion, applying style transfer at two levels of polyphonic composition: texture and orchestration. Experiments show that our system outperforms the baselines significantly, and the modular design offers effective controls in a musically meaningful way.

**ABSTRACT**  
Active learning is a promising paradigm to reduce the labeling cost by strategically requesting labels to improve model performance. However, existing active learning methods often rely on expensive acquisition function to compute, extensive modeling retraining and multiple rounds of interaction with annotators. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach for active learning, which aims to select batches of unlabeled instances through a learned surrogate model for data acquisition. A key challenge in this approach is developing an acquisition function that generalizes well, as the history of data, which forms part of the utility function's input, grows over time. Our novel algorithmic contribution is a bilevel multi-task bilevel optimization framework that predicts the relative utility -- measured by the validation accuracy -- of different training sets, and ensures the learned acquisition function generalizes effectively. For cases where validation accuracy is expensive to evaluate, we introduce efficient interpolation-based surrogate models to estimate the utility function, reducing the evaluation cost. We demonstrate the performance of our approach through extensive experiments on standard active classification benchmarks. By employing our learned utility function, we show significant improvements over traditional techniques, paving the way for more efficient and effective utility maximization in active learning applications.

**ABSTRACT**  
We propose controlled decoding (CD), a novel off-policy reinforcement learning method to control the autoregressive generation from language models towards high reward outcomes. CD solves an off-policy reinforcement learning problem through a value function for the reward, which we call a prefix scorer. The prefix scorer is used at inference time to steer the generation towards higher reward outcomes. We show that the prefix scorer may be trained on (possibly) off-policy data to predict the expected reward when decoding is continued from a partially decoded response. We empirically demonstrate that CD is effective as a control mechanism on Reddit conversations corpus. We also show that the modularity of the design of CD makes it possible to control for multiple rewards, effectively solving a multi-objective reinforcement learning problem with no additional complexity. Finally, we show that CD can be applied in a novel blockwise fashion at inference-time, again without the need for any training-time changes, essentially bridging the gap between the popular best-of-$K$ strategy and token-level reinforcement learning. This makes CD a promising approach for alignment of language models.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper combines two contributions. First, we introduce an extension of the Meta-World benchmark, which we call "Language-World," which allows a large language model to operate in a simulated robotic environment using semi-structured natural language queries and scripted skills described using natural language. By using the same set of tasks as Meta-World, Language-World results can be easily compared to Meta-World results, allowing for a point of comparison between recent methods using Large Language Models (LLMs) and those using Deep Reinforcement Learning. Second, we introduce a method we call Plan Conditioned Behavioral Cloning (PCBC), that allows finetuning the behavior of high-level plans using end-to-end demonstrations. Using Language-World, we show that PCBC is able to achieve strong performance in a variety of few-shot regimes, often achieving task generalization with as little as a single demonstration. We have made Language-World available as open-source software at https://github.com/krzentner/language-world/.

**ABSTRACT**  
Synthetic data serves as an alternative in training machine learning models, particularly when real-world data is limited or inaccessible. However, ensuring that synthetic data mirrors the complex nuances of real-world data is a challenging task. This paper addresses this issue by exploring the potential of integrating data-centric AI techniques which profile the data to guide the synthetic data generation process. Moreover, we shed light on the often ignored consequences of neglecting these data profiles during synthetic data generation -- despite seemingly high statistical fidelity. Subsequently, we propose a novel framework to evaluate the integration of data profiles to guide the creation of more representative synthetic data. In an empirical study, we evaluate the performance of five state-of-the-art models for tabular data generation on eleven distinct tabular datasets. The findings offer critical insights into the successes and limitations of current synthetic data generation techniques. Finally, we provide practical recommendations for integrating data-centric insights into the synthetic data generation process, with a specific focus on classification performance, model selection, and feature selection. This study aims to reevaluate conventional approaches to synthetic data generation and promote the application of data-centric AI techniques in improving the quality and effectiveness of synthetic data.

**ABSTRACT**  
The global need for effective disease diagnosis remains substantial, given the complexities of various disease mechanisms and diverse patient symptoms. To tackle these challenges, researchers, physicians, and patients are turning to machine learning (ML), an artificial intelligence (AI) discipline, to develop solutions. By leveraging sophisticated ML and AI methods, healthcare stakeholders gain enhanced diagnostic and treatment capabilities. However, there is a scarcity of research focused on ML algorithms for enhancing the accuracy and computational efficiency. This research investigates the capacity of machine learning algorithms to improve the transmission of heart rate data in time series healthcare metrics, concentrating particularly on optimizing accuracy and efficiency. By exploring various ML algorithms used in healthcare applications, the review presents the latest trends and approaches in ML-based disease diagnosis (MLBDD). The factors under consideration include the algorithm utilized, the types of diseases targeted, the data types employed, the applications, and the evaluation metrics. This review aims to shed light on the prospects of ML in healthcare, particularly in disease diagnosis. By analyzing the current literature, the study provides insights into state-of-the-art methodologies and their performance metrics.

**ABSTRACT**  
Positioned between pre-training and user deployment, aligning large language models (LLMs) through reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a prevailing strategy for training instruction following-models such as ChatGPT. In this work, we initiate the study of privacy-preserving alignment of LLMs through Differential Privacy (DP) in conjunction with RL. Following the influential work of Ziegler et al. (2020), we study two dominant paradigms: (i) alignment via RL without human in the loop (e.g., positive review generation) and (ii) alignment via RL from human feedback (RLHF) (e.g., summarization in a human-preferred way). We give a new DP framework to achieve alignment via RL, and prove its correctness. Our experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach, offering competitive utility while ensuring strong privacy protections.

**ABSTRACT**  
Transformer-based large language models have remarkable potential to accelerate design optimization for applications such as drug development and materials discovery. Self-supervised pretraining of transformer models requires large-scale datasets, which are often sparsely populated in topical areas such as polymer science. State-of-the-art approaches for polymers conduct data augmentation to generate additional samples but unavoidably incurs extra computational costs. In contrast, large-scale open-source datasets are available for small molecules and provide a potential solution to data scarcity through transfer learning. In this work, we show that using transformers pretrained on small molecules and fine-tuned on polymer properties achieve comparable accuracy to those trained on augmented polymer datasets for a series of benchmark prediction tasks.

**ABSTRACT**  
Real-world natural language processing systems need to be robust to human adversaries. Collecting examples of human adversaries for training is an effective but expensive solution. On the other hand, training on synthetic attacks with small perturbations - such as word-substitution - does not actually improve robustness to human adversaries. In this paper, we propose an adversarial training framework that uses limited human adversarial examples to generate more useful adversarial examples at scale. We demonstrate the advantages of this system on the ANLI and hate speech detection benchmark datasets - both collected via an iterative, adversarial human-and-model-in-the-loop procedure. Compared to training only on observed human attacks, also training on our synthetic adversarial examples improves model robustness to future rounds. In ANLI, we see accuracy gains on the current set of attacks (44.1%$\,\to\,$50.1%) and on two future unseen rounds of human generated attacks (32.5%$\,\to\,$43.4%, and 29.4%$\,\to\,$40.2%). In hate speech detection, we see AUC gains on current attacks (0.76 $\to$ 0.84) and a future round (0.77 $\to$ 0.79). Attacks from methods that do not learn the distribution of existing human adversaries, meanwhile, degrade robustness.

**ABSTRACT**  
We aim to produce a smaller language model that is aligned to user intent. Previous research has shown that applying distilled supervised fine-tuning (dSFT) on larger models significantly improves task accuracy; however, these models are unaligned, i.e. they do not respond well to natural prompts. To distill this property, we experiment with the use of preference data from AI Feedback (AIF). Starting from a dataset of outputs ranked by a teacher model, we apply distilled direct preference optimization (dDPO) to learn a chat model with significantly improved intent alignment. The approach requires only a few hours of training without any additional sampling during fine-tuning. The final result, Zephyr-7B, sets the state-of-the-art on chat benchmarks for 7B parameter models, and requires no human annotation. In particular, results on MT-Bench show that Zephyr-7B surpasses Llama2-Chat-70B, the best open-access RLHF-based model. Code, models, data, and tutorials for the system are available at https://github.com/huggingface/alignment-handbook.

**ABSTRACT**  
Benefiting from high-quality datasets and standardized evaluation metrics, machine learning (ML) has achieved sustained progress and widespread applications. However, while applying machine learning to relational databases (RDBs), the absence of a well-established benchmark remains a significant obstacle to the development of ML. To address this issue, we introduce ML Benchmark For Relational Databases (RDBench), a standardized benchmark that aims to promote reproducible ML research on RDBs that include multiple tables. RDBench offers diverse RDB datasets of varying scales, domains, and relational structures, organized into 4 levels. Notably, to simplify the adoption of RDBench for diverse ML domains, for any given database, RDBench exposes three types of interfaces including tabular data, homogeneous graphs, and heterogeneous graphs, sharing the same underlying task definition. For the first time, RDBench enables meaningful comparisons between ML methods from diverse domains, ranging from XGBoost to Graph Neural Networks, under RDB prediction tasks. We design multiple classification and regression tasks for each RDB dataset and report averaged results over the same dataset, further enhancing the robustness of the experimental findings. RDBench is implemented with DBGym, a user-friendly platform for ML research and application on databases, enabling benchmarking new ML methods with RDBench at ease.

**ABSTRACT**  
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures offer a general solution to the high inference costs of large language models (LLMs) via sparse routing, bringing faster and more accurate models, at the cost of massive parameter counts. For example, the SwitchTransformer-c2048 model has 1.6 trillion parameters, requiring 3.2TB of accelerator memory to run efficiently, which makes practical deployment challenging and expensive. In this paper, we present a solution to this memory problem, in form of a new compression and execution framework called QMoE. Specifically, QMoE consists of a scalable algorithm which accurately compresses trillion-parameter MoEs to less than 1 bit per parameter, in a custom format co-designed with bespoke GPU decoding kernels to facilitate efficient end-to-end compressed inference, with minor runtime overheads relative to uncompressed execution. Concretely, QMoE can compress the 1.6 trillion parameter SwitchTransformer-c2048 model to less than 160GB (20x compression, 0.8 bits per parameter) at only minor accuracy loss, in less than a day on a single GPU. This enables, for the first time, the execution of a trillion-parameter model on affordable commodity hardware, like a single server with 4x NVIDIA A6000 or 8x NVIDIA 3090 GPUs, at less than 5% runtime overhead relative to ideal uncompressed inference. The source code and compressed models are available at github.com/IST-DASLab/qmoe.

**ABSTRACT**  
We introduce the 'Stochastic Latent Transformer', a probabilistic deep learning approach for efficient reduced-order modelling of stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs). Despite recent advances in deep learning for fluid mechanics, limited research has explored modelling stochastically driven flows - which play a crucial role in understanding a broad spectrum of phenomena, from jets on giant planets to ocean circulation and the variability of midlatitude weather. The model architecture consists of a stochastically-forced transformer, paired with a translation-equivariant autoencoder, that we demonstrate is capable of reproducing system dynamics across various integration periods. We demonstrate its effectiveness applied to a well-researched zonal jet system, with the neural network achieving a five-order-of-magnitude speedup compared to numerical integration. This facilitates the cost-effective generation of large ensembles, enabling the exploration of statistical questions concerning probabilities of spontaneous transition events.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recently, there has been an increasing interest in automated prompt optimization based on reinforcement learning (RL). This approach offers important advantages, such as generating interpretable prompts and being compatible with black-box foundation models. However, the substantial prompt space size poses challenges for RL-based methods, often leading to suboptimal policy convergence. This paper introduces MultiPrompter, a new framework that views prompt optimization as a cooperative game between prompters which take turns composing a prompt together. Our cooperative prompt optimization effectively reduces the problem size and helps prompters learn optimal prompts. We test our method on the text-to-image task and show its ability to generate higher-quality images than baselines.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recent advancements in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) establish the basis to address challenging tasks. However, with the integration of AI, new risks arise. Therefore, to benefit from its advantages, it is essential to adequately handle the risks associated with AI. Existing risk management processes in related fields, such as software systems, need to sufficiently consider the specifics of AI. A key challenge is to systematically and transparently identify and address AI risks' root causes - also called AI hazards. This paper introduces the AI Hazard Management (AIHM) framework, which provides a structured process to systematically identify, assess, and treat AI hazards. The proposed process is conducted in parallel with the development to ensure that any AI hazard is captured at the earliest possible stage of the AI system's life cycle. In addition, to ensure the AI system's auditability, the proposed framework systematically documents evidence that the potential impact of identified AI hazards could be reduced to a tolerable level. The framework builds upon an AI hazard list from a comprehensive state-of-the-art analysis. Also, we provide a taxonomy that supports the optimal treatment of the identified AI hazards. Additionally, we illustrate how the AIHM framework can increase the overall quality of a power grid AI use case by systematically reducing the impact of identified hazards to an acceptable level.

**ABSTRACT**  
Image-based Reinforcement Learning is a practical yet challenging task. A major hurdle lies in extracting control-centric representations while disregarding irrelevant information. While approaches that follow the bisimulation principle exhibit the potential in learning state representations to address this issue, they still grapple with the limited expressive capacity of latent dynamics and the inadaptability to sparse reward environments. To address these limitations, we introduce ReBis, which aims to capture control-centric information by integrating reward-free control information alongside reward-specific knowledge. ReBis utilizes a transformer architecture to implicitly model the dynamics and incorporates block-wise masking to eliminate spatiotemporal redundancy. Moreover, ReBis combines bisimulation-based loss with asymmetric reconstruction loss to prevent feature collapse in environments with sparse rewards. Empirical studies on two large benchmarks, including Atari games and DeepMind Control Suit, demonstrate that ReBis has superior performance compared to existing methods, proving its effectiveness.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this study, we leverage a deep learning-based method for the automatic diagnosis of schizophrenia using EEG brain recordings. This approach utilizes generative data augmentation, a powerful technique that enhances the accuracy of the diagnosis. To enable the utilization of time-frequency features, spectrograms were extracted from the raw signals. After exploring several neural network architectural setups, a proper convolutional neural network (CNN) was used for the initial diagnosis. Subsequently, using Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP) and Variational Autoencoder (VAE), two different synthetic datasets were generated in order to augment the initial dataset and address the over-fitting issue. The augmented dataset using VAE achieved a 3.0\% improvement in accuracy reaching up to 99.0\% and yielded a lower loss value as well as a faster convergence. Finally, we addressed the lack of trust in black-box models using the Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) algorithm to determine the most important superpixels (frequencies) in the diagnosis process.

**ABSTRACT**  
Within the domain of e-commerce retail, an important objective is the reduction of parcel loss during the last-mile delivery phase. The ever-increasing availability of data, including product, customer, and order information, has made it possible for the application of machine learning in parcel loss prediction. However, a significant challenge arises from the inherent imbalance in the data, i.e., only a very low percentage of parcels are lost. In this paper, we propose two machine learning approaches, namely, Data Balance with Supervised Learning (DBSL) and Deep Hybrid Ensemble Learning (DHEL), to accurately predict parcel loss. The practical implication of such predictions is their value in aiding e-commerce retailers in optimizing insurance-related decision-making policies. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed machine learning models using one year data from Belgian shipments. The findings show that the DHEL model, which combines a feed-forward autoencoder with a random forest, achieves the highest classification performance. Furthermore, we use the techniques from Explainable AI (XAI) to illustrate how prediction models can be used in enhancing business processes and augmenting the overall value proposition for e-commerce retailers in the last mile delivery.

**ABSTRACT**  
Uncertainty estimation aims to evaluate the confidence of a trained deep neural network. However, existing uncertainty estimation approaches rely on low-dimensional distributional assumptions and thus suffer from the high dimensionality of latent features. Existing approaches tend to focus on uncertainty on discrete classification probabilities, which leads to poor generalizability to uncertainty estimation for other tasks. Moreover, most of the literature requires seeing the out-of-distribution (OOD) data in the training for better estimation of uncertainty, which limits the uncertainty estimation performance in practice because the OOD data are typically unseen. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new framework using data-adaptive high-dimensional hypothesis testing for uncertainty estimation, which leverages the statistical properties of the feature representations. Our method directly operates on latent representations and thus does not require retraining the feature encoder under a modified objective. The test statistic relaxes the feature distribution assumptions to high dimensionality, and it is more discriminative to uncertainties in the latent representations. We demonstrate that encoding features with Bayesian neural networks can enhance testing performance and lead to more accurate uncertainty estimation. We further introduce a family-wise testing procedure to determine the optimal threshold of OOD detection, which minimizes the false discovery rate (FDR). Extensive experiments validate the satisfactory performance of our framework on uncertainty estimation and task-specific prediction over a variety of competitors. The experiments on the OOD detection task also show satisfactory performance of our method when the OOD data are unseen in the training.

**ABSTRACT**  
Distributional reinforcement learning algorithms have attempted to utilize estimated uncertainty for exploration, such as optimism in the face of uncertainty. However, using the estimated variance for optimistic exploration may cause biased data collection and hinder convergence or performance. In this paper, we present a novel distributional reinforcement learning algorithm that selects actions by randomizing risk criterion to avoid one-sided tendency on risk. We provide a perturbed distributional Bellman optimality operator by distorting the risk measure and prove the convergence and optimality of the proposed method with the weaker contraction property. Our theoretical results support that the proposed method does not fall into biased exploration and is guaranteed to converge to an optimal return. Finally, we empirically show that our method outperforms other existing distribution-based algorithms in various environments including Atari 55 games.

**ABSTRACT**  
Graph-level anomaly detection (GLAD) aims to identify graphs that exhibit notable dissimilarity compared to the majority in a collection. However, current works primarily focus on evaluating graph-level abnormality while failing to provide meaningful explanations for the predictions, which largely limits their reliability and application scope. In this paper, we investigate a new challenging problem, explainable GLAD, where the learning objective is to predict the abnormality of each graph sample with corresponding explanations, i.e., the vital subgraph that leads to the predictions. To address this challenging problem, we propose a Self-Interpretable Graph aNomaly dETection model (SIGNET for short) that detects anomalous graphs as well as generates informative explanations simultaneously. Specifically, we first introduce the multi-view subgraph information bottleneck (MSIB) framework, serving as the design basis of our self-interpretable GLAD approach. This way SIGNET is able to not only measure the abnormality of each graph based on cross-view mutual information but also provide informative graph rationales by extracting bottleneck subgraphs from the input graph and its dual hypergraph in a self-supervised way. Extensive experiments on 16 datasets demonstrate the anomaly detection capability and self-interpretability of SIGNET.

**ABSTRACT**  
As algorithmic decision-making systems become more prevalent in society, ensuring the fairness of these systems is becoming increasingly important. Whilst there has been substantial research in building fair algorithmic decision-making systems, the majority of these methods require access to the training data, including personal characteristics, and are not transparent regarding which individuals are classified unfairly. In this paper, we propose a novel model-agnostic argumentation-based method to determine why an individual is classified differently in comparison to similar individuals. Our method uses a quantitative argumentation framework to represent attribute-value pairs of an individual and of those similar to them, and uses a well-known semantics to identify the attribute-value pairs in the individual contributing most to their different classification. We evaluate our method on two datasets commonly used in the fairness literature and illustrate its effectiveness in the identification of bias.

**ABSTRACT**  
Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful approach for tackling complex problems. The recent introduction of multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) has further expanded the scope of RL by enabling agents to make trade-offs among multiple objectives. This advancement not only has broadened the range of problems that can be tackled but also created numerous opportunities for exploration and advancement. Yet, the effectiveness of RL agents heavily relies on appropriately setting their hyperparameters. In practice, this task often proves to be challenging, leading to unsuccessful deployments of these techniques in various instances. Hence, prior research has explored hyperparameter optimization in RL to address this concern.   This paper presents an initial investigation into the challenge of hyperparameter optimization specifically for MORL. We formalize the problem, highlight its distinctive challenges, and propose a systematic methodology to address it. The proposed methodology is applied to a well-known environment using a state-of-the-art MORL algorithm, and preliminary results are reported. Our findings indicate that the proposed methodology can effectively provide hyperparameter configurations that significantly enhance the performance of MORL agents. Furthermore, this study identifies various future research opportunities to further advance the field of hyperparameter optimization for MORL.

**ABSTRACT**  
Event detection in time series data is crucial in various domains, including finance, healthcare, cybersecurity, and science. Accurately identifying events in time series data is vital for making informed decisions, detecting anomalies, and predicting future trends. Despite extensive research exploring diverse methods for event detection in time series, with deep learning approaches being among the most advanced, there is still room for improvement and innovation in this field. In this paper, we present a new deep learning supervised method for detecting events in multivariate time series data. Our method combines four distinct novelties compared to existing deep-learning supervised methods. Firstly, it is based on regression instead of binary classification. Secondly, it does not require labeled datasets where each point is labeled; instead, it only requires reference events defined as time points or intervals of time. Thirdly, it is designed to be robust by using a stacked ensemble learning meta-model that combines deep learning models, ranging from classic feed-forward neural networks (FFNs) to state-of-the-art architectures like transformers. This ensemble approach can mitigate individual model weaknesses and biases, resulting in more robust predictions. Finally, to facilitate practical implementation, we have developed a Python package to accompany our proposed method. The package, called eventdetector-ts, can be installed through the Python Package Index (PyPI). In this paper, we present our method and provide a comprehensive guide on the usage of the package. We showcase its versatility and effectiveness through different real-world use cases from natural language processing (NLP) to financial security domains.

**ABSTRACT**  
The process of developing control functions for embedded systems is resource-, time-, and data-intensive, often resulting in sub-optimal cost and solutions approaches. Reinforcement Learning (RL) has great potential for autonomously training agents to perform complex control tasks with minimal human intervention. Due to costly data generation and safety constraints, however, its application is mostly limited to purely simulated domains. To use RL effectively in embedded system function development, the generated agents must be able to handle real-world applications. In this context, this work focuses on accelerating the training process of RL agents by combining Transfer Learning (TL) and X-in-the-Loop (XiL) simulation. For the use case of transient exhaust gas re-circulation control for an internal combustion engine, use of a computationally cheap Model-in-the-Loop (MiL) simulation is made to select a suitable algorithm, fine-tune hyperparameters, and finally train candidate agents for the transfer. These pre-trained RL agents are then fine-tuned in a Hardware-in-the-Loop (HiL) system via TL. The transfer revealed the need for adjusting the reward parameters when advancing to real hardware. Further, the comparison between a purely HiL-trained and a transferred agent showed a reduction of training time by a factor of 5.9. The results emphasize the necessity to train RL agents with real hardware, and demonstrate that the maturity of the transferred policies affects both training time and performance, highlighting the strong synergies between TL and XiL simulation.

**ABSTRACT**  
Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) has been an effective way to leverage abundant unlabeled data with extremely scarce labeled data. However, most SSL methods are commonly based on instance-wise consistency between different data transformations. Therefore, the label guidance on labeled data is hard to be propagated to unlabeled data. Consequently, the learning process on labeled data is much faster than on unlabeled data which is likely to fall into a local minima that does not favor unlabeled data, leading to sub-optimal generalization performance. In this paper, we propose FlatMatch which minimizes a cross-sharpness measure to ensure consistent learning performance between the two datasets. Specifically, we increase the empirical risk on labeled data to obtain a worst-case model which is a failure case that needs to be enhanced. Then, by leveraging the richness of unlabeled data, we penalize the prediction difference (i.e., cross-sharpness) between the worst-case model and the original model so that the learning direction is beneficial to generalization on unlabeled data. Therefore, we can calibrate the learning process without being limited to insufficient label information. As a result, the mismatched learning performance can be mitigated, further enabling the effective exploitation of unlabeled data and improving SSL performance. Through comprehensive validation, we show FlatMatch achieves state-of-the-art results in many SSL settings.

**ABSTRACT**  
Traditionally, graph neural networks have been trained using a single observed graph. However, the observed graph represents only one possible realization. In many applications, the graph may encounter uncertainties, such as having erroneous or missing edges, as well as edge weights that provide little informative value. To address these challenges and capture additional information previously absent in the observed graph, we introduce latent variables to parameterize and generate multiple graphs. We obtain the maximum likelihood estimate of the network parameters in an Expectation-Maximization (EM) framework based on the multiple graphs. Specifically, we iteratively determine the distribution of the graphs using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, incorporating the principles of PAC-Bayesian theory. Numerical experiments demonstrate improvements in performance against baseline models on node classification for heterogeneous graphs and graph regression on chemistry datasets.

**ABSTRACT**  
The pre-training architectures of large language models encompass various types, including autoencoding models, autoregressive models, and encoder-decoder models. We posit that any modality can potentially benefit from a large language model, as long as it undergoes vector quantization to become discrete tokens. Inspired by GLM, we propose a General Point Model (GPM) which seamlessly integrates autoencoding and autoregressive tasks in point cloud transformer. This model is versatile, allowing fine-tuning for downstream point cloud representation tasks, as well as unconditional and conditional generation tasks. GPM enhances masked prediction in autoencoding through various forms of mask padding tasks, leading to improved performance in point cloud understanding. Additionally, GPM demonstrates highly competitive results in unconditional point cloud generation tasks, even exhibiting the potential for conditional generation tasks by modifying the input's conditional information. Compared to models like Point-BERT, MaskPoint and PointMAE, our GPM achieves superior performance in point cloud understanding tasks. Furthermore, the integration of autoregressive and autoencoding within the same transformer underscores its versatility across different downstream tasks.

**ABSTRACT**  
Anomaly detection on dynamic graphs refers to detecting entities whose behaviors obviously deviate from the norms observed within graphs and their temporal information. This field has drawn increasing attention due to its application in finance, network security, social networks, and more. However, existing methods face two challenges: dynamic structure constructing challenge - difficulties in capturing graph structure with complex time information and negative sampling challenge - unable to construct excellent negative samples for unsupervised learning. To address these challenges, we propose Unsupervised Generative Anomaly Detection on Dynamic Graphs (GADY). To tackle the first challenge, we propose a continuous dynamic graph model to capture the fine-grained information, which breaks the limit of existing discrete methods. Specifically, we employ a message-passing framework combined with positional features to get edge embeddings, which are decoded to identify anomalies. For the second challenge, we pioneer the use of Generative Adversarial Networks to generate negative interactions. Moreover, we design a loss function to alter the training goal of the generator while ensuring the diversity and quality of generated samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed GADY significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method on three real-world datasets. Supplementary experiments further validate the effectiveness of our model design and the necessity of each module.

**ABSTRACT**  
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) resurge as a trending research subject owing to their impressive ability to capture representations from graph-structured data. However, the black-box nature of GNNs presents a significant challenge in terms of comprehending and trusting these models, thereby limiting their practical applications in mission-critical scenarios. Although there has been substantial progress in the field of explaining GNNs in recent years, the majority of these studies are centered on static graphs, leaving the explanation of dynamic GNNs largely unexplored. Dynamic GNNs, with their ever-evolving graph structures, pose a unique challenge and require additional efforts to effectively capture temporal dependencies and structural relationships. To address this challenge, we present DyExplainer, a novel approach to explaining dynamic GNNs on the fly. DyExplainer trains a dynamic GNN backbone to extract representations of the graph at each snapshot, while simultaneously exploring structural relationships and temporal dependencies through a sparse attention technique. To preserve the desired properties of the explanation, such as structural consistency and temporal continuity, we augment our approach with contrastive learning techniques to provide priori-guided regularization. To model longer-term temporal dependencies, we develop a buffer-based live-updating scheme for training. The results of our extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate the superiority of DyExplainer, not only providing faithful explainability of the model predictions but also significantly improving the model prediction accuracy, as evidenced in the link prediction task.

**ABSTRACT**  
Actor Critic methods have found immense applications on a wide range of Reinforcement Learning tasks especially when the state-action space is large. In this paper, we consider actor critic and natural actor critic algorithms with function approximation for constrained Markov decision processes (C-MDP) involving inequality constraints and carry out a non-asymptotic analysis for both of these algorithms in a non-i.i.d (Markovian) setting. We consider the long-run average cost criterion where both the objective and the constraint functions are suitable policy-dependent long-run averages of certain prescribed cost functions. We handle the inequality constraints using the Lagrange multiplier method. We prove that these algorithms are guaranteed to find a first-order stationary point (i.e., $\Vert \nabla L(\theta,\gamma)\Vert_2^2 \leq \epsilon$) of the performance (Lagrange) function $L(\theta,\gamma)$, with a sample complexity of $\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(\epsilon^{-2.5})$ in the case of both Constrained Actor Critic (C-AC) and Constrained Natural Actor Critic (C-NAC) algorithms.We also show the results of experiments on a few different grid world settings and observe good empirical performance using both of these algorithms. In particular, for large grid sizes, Constrained Natural Actor Critic shows slightly better results than Constrained Actor Critic while the latter is slightly better for a small grid size.

**ABSTRACT**  
The recent progress of AI can be largely attributed to large language models (LLMs). However, their escalating memory requirements introduce challenges for machine learning (ML) researchers and engineers. Addressing this requires developers to partition a large model to distribute it across multiple GPUs or TPUs. This necessitates considerable coding and intricate configuration efforts with existing model parallel tools, such as Megatron-LM, DeepSpeed, and Alpa. These tools require users' expertise in machine learning systems (MLSys), creating a bottleneck in LLM development, particularly for developers without MLSys background. In this work, we present Redco, a lightweight and user-friendly tool crafted to automate distributed training and inference for LLMs, as well as to simplify ML pipeline development. The design of Redco emphasizes two key aspects. Firstly, to automate model parallism, our study identifies two straightforward rules to generate tensor parallel strategies for any given LLM. Integrating these rules into Redco facilitates effortless distributed LLM training and inference, eliminating the need of additional coding or complex configurations. We demonstrate the effectiveness by applying Redco on a set of LLM architectures, such as GPT-J, LLaMA, T5, and OPT, up to the size of 66B. Secondly, we propose a mechanism that allows for the customization of diverse ML pipelines through the definition of merely three functions, eliminating redundant and formulaic code like multi-host related processing. This mechanism proves adaptable across a spectrum of ML algorithms, from foundational language modeling to complex algorithms like meta-learning and reinforcement learning. Consequently, Redco implementations exhibit much fewer code lines compared to their official counterparts.

**ABSTRACT**  
Transformer Hawkes process models have shown to be successful in modeling event sequence data. However, most of the existing training methods rely on maximizing the likelihood of event sequences, which involves calculating some intractable integral. Moreover, the existing methods fail to provide uncertainty quantification for model predictions, e.g., confidence intervals for the predicted event's arrival time. To address these issues, we propose SMURF-THP, a score-based method for learning Transformer Hawkes process and quantifying prediction uncertainty. Specifically, SMURF-THP learns the score function of events' arrival time based on a score-matching objective that avoids the intractable computation. With such a learned score function, we can sample arrival time of events from the predictive distribution. This naturally allows for the quantification of uncertainty by computing confidence intervals over the generated samples. We conduct extensive experiments in both event type prediction and uncertainty quantification of arrival time. In all the experiments, SMURF-THP outperforms existing likelihood-based methods in confidence calibration while exhibiting comparable prediction accuracy.

**ABSTRACT**  
Despite its practical importance across a wide range of modalities, recent advances in self-supervised learning (SSL) have been primarily focused on a few well-curated domains, e.g., vision and language, often relying on their domain-specific knowledge. For example, Masked Auto-Encoder (MAE) has become one of the popular architectures in these domains, but less has explored its potential in other modalities. In this paper, we develop MAE as a unified, modality-agnostic SSL framework. In turn, we argue meta-learning as a key to interpreting MAE as a modality-agnostic learner, and propose enhancements to MAE from the motivation to jointly improve its SSL across diverse modalities, coined MetaMAE as a result. Our key idea is to view the mask reconstruction of MAE as a meta-learning task: masked tokens are predicted by adapting the Transformer meta-learner through the amortization of unmasked tokens. Based on this novel interpretation, we propose to integrate two advanced meta-learning techniques. First, we adapt the amortized latent of the Transformer encoder using gradient-based meta-learning to enhance the reconstruction. Then, we maximize the alignment between amortized and adapted latents through task contrastive learning which guides the Transformer encoder to better encode the task-specific knowledge. Our experiment demonstrates the superiority of MetaMAE in the modality-agnostic SSL benchmark (called DABS), significantly outperforming prior baselines. Code is available at https://github.com/alinlab/MetaMAE.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper delves into the intricacies of code summarization using advanced transformer-based language models. Through empirical studies, we evaluate the efficacy of code summarization by altering function and variable names to explore whether models truly understand code semantics or merely rely on textual cues. We have also introduced adversaries like dead code and commented code across three programming languages (Python, Javascript, and Java) to further scrutinize the model's understanding. Ultimately, our research aims to offer valuable insights into the inner workings of transformer-based LMs, enhancing their ability to understand code and contributing to more efficient software development practices and maintenance workflows.

**ABSTRACT**  
Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is widely used to optimize the performance of multi-UAV networks. However, the training of DRL relies on the frequent interactions between the UAVs and the environment, which consumes lots of energy due to the flying and communication of UAVs in practical experiments. Inspired by the growing digital twin (DT) technology, which can simulate the performance of algorithms in the digital space constructed by coping features of the physical space, the DT is introduced to reduce the costs of practical training, e.g., energy and hardware purchases. Different from previous DT-assisted works with an assumption of perfect reflecting real physics by virtual digital, we consider an imperfect DT model with deviations for assisting the training of multi-UAV networks. Remarkably, to trade off the training cost, DT construction cost, and the impact of deviations of DT on training, the natural and virtually generated UAV mixing deployment method is proposed. Two cascade neural networks (NN) are used to optimize the joint number of virtually generated UAVs, the DT construction cost, and the performance of multi-UAV networks. These two NNs are trained by unsupervised and reinforcement learning, both low-cost label-free training methods. Simulation results show the training cost can significantly decrease while guaranteeing the training performance. This implies that an efficient decision can be made with imperfect DTs in multi-UAV networks.

**ABSTRACT**  
Graph data widely exists in real life, with large amounts of data and complex structures. It is necessary to map graph data to low-dimensional embedding. Graph classification, a critical graph task, mainly relies on identifying the important substructures within the graph. At present, some graph classification methods do not combine the multi-granularity characteristics of graph data. This lack of granularity distinction in modeling leads to a conflation of key information and false correlations within the model. So, achieving the desired goal of a credible and interpretable model becomes challenging. This paper proposes a causal disentangled multi-granularity graph representation learning method (CDM-GNN) to solve this challenge. The CDM-GNN model disentangles the important substructures and bias parts within the graph from a multi-granularity perspective. The disentanglement of the CDM-GNN model reveals important and bias parts, forming the foundation for its classification task, specifically, model interpretations. The CDM-GNN model exhibits strong classification performance and generates explanatory outcomes aligning with human cognitive patterns. In order to verify the effectiveness of the model, this paper compares the three real-world datasets MUTAG, PTC, and IMDM-M. Six state-of-the-art models, namely GCN, GAT, Top-k, ASAPool, SUGAR, and SAT are employed for comparison purposes. Additionally, a qualitative analysis of the interpretation results is conducted.

**ABSTRACT**  
Accurately forecasting solar power generation is crucial in the global progression towards sustainable energy systems. In this study, we conduct a meticulous comparison between Quantum Long Short-Term Memory (QLSTM) and classical Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models for solar power production forecasting. Our controlled experiments reveal promising advantages of QLSTMs, including accelerated training convergence and substantially reduced test loss within the initial epoch compared to classical LSTMs. These empirical findings demonstrate QLSTM's potential to swiftly assimilate complex time series relationships, enabled by quantum phenomena like superposition. However, realizing QLSTM's full capabilities necessitates further research into model validation across diverse conditions, systematic hyperparameter optimization, hardware noise resilience, and applications to correlated renewable forecasting problems. With continued progress, quantum machine learning can offer a paradigm shift in renewable energy time series prediction. This pioneering work provides initial evidence substantiating quantum advantages over classical LSTM, while acknowledging present limitations. Through rigorous benchmarking grounded in real-world data, our study elucidates a promising trajectory for quantum learning in renewable forecasting. Additional research and development can further actualize this potential to achieve unprecedented accuracy and reliability in predicting solar power generation worldwide.

**ABSTRACT**  
Providing personalized assistance at scale is a long-standing challenge for computing educators, but a new generation of tools powered by large language models (LLMs) offers immense promise. Such tools can, in theory, provide on-demand help in large class settings and be configured with appropriate guardrails to prevent misuse and mitigate common concerns around learner over-reliance. However, the deployment of LLM-powered tools in authentic classroom settings is still rare, and very little is currently known about how students will use them in practice and what type of help they will seek. To address this, we examine students' use of an innovative LLM-powered tool that provides on-demand programming assistance without revealing solutions directly. We deployed the tool for 12 weeks in an introductory computer and data science course ($n = 52$), collecting more than 2,500 queries submitted by students throughout the term. We manually categorized all student queries based on the type of assistance sought, and we automatically analyzed several additional query characteristics. We found that most queries requested immediate help with programming assignments, whereas fewer requests asked for help on related concepts or for deepening conceptual understanding. Furthermore, students often provided minimal information to the tool, suggesting this is an area in which targeted instruction would be beneficial. We also found that students who achieved more success in the course tended to have used the tool more frequently overall. Lessons from this research can be leveraged by programming educators and institutions who plan to augment their teaching with emerging LLM-powered tools.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this paper we bring to light the infrastructuring work carried out by people in Lebanon to establish and maintain everyday security in response to multiple simultaneously failing infrastructures. We do so through interviews with 13 participants from 12 digital and human rights organisations and two weeks of ethnographically informed fieldwork in Beirut, Lebanon, in July 2022. Through our analysis we develop the notion of security patchworking that makes visible the infrastructuring work necessitated to secure basic needs such as electricity provision, identity authentication and financial resources. Such practices are rooted in differing mechanisms of protection that often result in new forms of insecurity. We discuss the implications for CSCW and HCI researchers and point to security patchworking as a lens to be used when designing technologies to support infrastructuring, while advocating for collaborative work across CSCW and security research.

**ABSTRACT**  
With policing coming under greater scrutiny in recent years, researchers have begun to more thoroughly study the effects of contact between police and minority communities. Despite data archives of hundreds of thousands of recorded Broadcast Police Communications (BPC) being openly available to the public, a closer look at a large-scale analysis of the language of policing has remained largely unexplored. While this research is critical in understanding a "pre-reflective" notion of policing, the large quantity of data presents numerous challenges in its organization and analysis.   In this paper, we describe preliminary work towards enabling Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) in an analysis of the Chicago Police Department's (CPD) BPC by demonstrating the pipelined creation of a datastore to enable a multimodal analysis of composed raw audio files.

**ABSTRACT**  
As the peak of the solar cycle approaches in 2025 and the ability of a single geomagnetic storm to significantly alter the orbit of Resident Space Objects (RSOs), techniques for atmospheric density forecasting are vital for space situational awareness. While linear data-driven methods, such as dynamic mode decomposition with control (DMDc), have been used previously for forecasting atmospheric density, deep learning-based forecasting has the ability to capture nonlinearities in data. By learning multiple layer weights from historical atmospheric density data, long-term dependencies in the dataset are captured in the mapping between the current atmospheric density state and control input to the atmospheric density state at the next timestep. This work improves upon previous linear propagation methods for atmospheric density forecasting, by developing a nonlinear transformer-based architecture for atmospheric density forecasting. Empirical NRLMSISE-00 and JB2008, as well as physics-based TIEGCM atmospheric density models are compared for forecasting with DMDc and with the transformer-based propagator.

**ABSTRACT**  
Despite their groundbreaking performance for many generative modeling tasks, diffusion models have fallen short on discrete data domains such as natural language. Crucially, standard diffusion models rely on the well-established theory of score matching, but efforts to generalize this to discrete structures have not yielded the same empirical gains. In this work, we bridge this gap by proposing score entropy, a novel discrete score matching loss that is more stable than existing methods, forms an ELBO for maximum likelihood training, and can be efficiently optimized with a denoising variant. We scale our Score Entropy Discrete Diffusion models (SEDD) to the experimental setting of GPT-2, achieving highly competitive likelihoods while also introducing distinct algorithmic advantages. In particular, when comparing similarly sized SEDD and GPT-2 models, SEDD attains comparable perplexities (normally within $+10\%$ of and sometimes outperforming the baseline). Furthermore, SEDD models learn a more faithful sequence distribution (around $4\times$ better compared to GPT-2 models with ancestral sampling as measured by large models), can trade off compute for generation quality (needing only $16\times$ fewer network evaluations to match GPT-2), and enables arbitrary infilling beyond the standard left to right prompting.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recognizing the explosive increase in the use of DNN-based applications, several industrial companies developed a custom ASIC (e.g., Google TPU, IBM RaPiD, Intel NNP-I/NNP-T) and constructed a hyperscale cloud infrastructure with it. The ASIC performs operations of the inference or training process of DNN models which are requested by users. Since the DNN models have different data formats and types of operations, the ASIC needs to support diverse data formats and generality for the operations. However, the conventional ASICs do not fulfill these requirements. To overcome the limitations of it, we propose a flexible DNN accelerator called All-rounder. The accelerator is designed with an area-efficient multiplier supporting multiple precisions of integer and floating point datatypes. In addition, it constitutes a flexibly fusible and fissionable MAC array to support various types of DNN operations efficiently. We implemented the register transfer level (RTL) design using Verilog and synthesized it in 28nm CMOS technology. To examine practical effectiveness of our proposed designs, we designed two multiply units and three state-of-the-art DNN accelerators. We compare our multiplier with the multiply units and perform architectural evaluation on performance and energy efficiency with eight real-world DNN models. Furthermore, we compare benefits of the All-rounder accelerator to a high-end GPU card, i.e., NVIDIA GeForce RTX30390. The proposed All-rounder accelerator universally has speedup and high energy efficiency in various DNN benchmarks than the baselines.

**ABSTRACT**  
Robots performing human-scale manipulation tasks require an extensive amount of knowledge about their surroundings in order to perform their actions competently and human-like. In this work, we investigate the use of virtual reality technology as an implementation for robot environment modeling, and present a technique for translating scene graphs into knowledge bases. To this end, we take advantage of the Universal Scene Description (USD) format which is an emerging standard for the authoring, visualization and simulation of complex environments. We investigate the conversion of USD-based environment models into Knowledge Graph (KG) representations that facilitate semantic querying and integration with additional knowledge sources.

**ABSTRACT**  
Multi-agent reinforcement learning based methods are significant for online planning of feasible and safe paths for agents in dynamic and uncertain scenarios. Although some methods like fully centralized and fully decentralized methods achieve a certain measure of success, they also encounter problems such as dimension explosion and poor convergence, respectively. In this paper, we propose a novel centralized training with decentralized execution method based on multi-agent reinforcement learning to solve the dynamic obstacle avoidance problem online. In this approach, each agent communicates only with the central planner or only with its neighbors, respectively, to plan feasible and safe paths online. We improve our methods based on the idea of model predictive control to increase the training efficiency and sample utilization of agents. The experimental results in both simulation, indoor, and outdoor environments validate the effectiveness of our method.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recognition of the current state is indispensable for the operation of a robot. There are various states to be recognized, such as whether an elevator door is open or closed, whether an object has been grasped correctly, and whether the TV is turned on or off. Until now, these states have been recognized by programmatically describing the state of a point cloud or raw image, by annotating and learning images, by using special sensors, etc. In contrast to these methods, we apply Visual Question Answering (VQA) from a Pre-Trained Vision-Language Model (PTVLM) trained on a large-scale dataset, to such binary state recognition. This idea allows us to intuitively describe state recognition in language without any re-training, thereby improving the recognition ability of robots in a simple and general way. We summarize various techniques in questioning methods and image processing, and clarify their properties through experiments.

**ABSTRACT**  
What should a data integration framework for knowledge engineers look like? Recent research on Knowledge Graph construction proposes the design of a fa\c{c}ade, a notion borrowed from object-oriented software engineering. This idea is applied to SPARQL Anything, a system that allows querying heterogeneous resources as-if they were in RDF, in plain SPARQL 1.1, by overloading the SERVICE clause. SPARQL Anything supports a wide variety of file formats, from popular ones (CSV, JSON, XML, Spreadsheets) to others that are not supported by alternative solutions (Markdown, YAML, DOCx, Bibtex). Features include querying Web APIs with high flexibility, parametrised queries, and chaining multiple transformations into complex pipelines. In this paper, we describe the design rationale and software architecture of the SPARQL Anything system. We provide references to an extensive set of reusable, real-world scenarios from various application domains. We report on the value-to-users of the founding assumptions of its design, compared to alternative solutions through a community survey and a field report from the industry.

Automating code documentation through explanatory text can prove highly beneficial in code understanding. Large Language Models (LLMs) have made remarkable strides in Natural Language Processing, especially within software engineering tasks such as code generation and code summarization. This study specifically delves into the task of generating natural-language summaries for code snippets, using various LLMs. The findings indicate that Code LLMs outperform their generic counterparts, and zero-shot methods yield superior results when dealing with datasets with dissimilar distributions between training and testing sets.

**ABSTRACT**  
Despite its already widespread popularity, it continues to gain adoption. More and more developers and architects continue to adopt and apply the FaaS (Function as a Service) model in cloud solutions. The most extensively used FaaS service is AWS Lambda, provided by Amazon Web Services. Moreover, despite the new trends in programming languages, Java still maintains a significant share of usage. The main problem that arises when using these two technologies together is widely known: significant latencies and the dreaded cold start. However, it is possible to greatly mitigate this problem without dedicating too much effort. In this article, various techniques, strategies and approaches will be studied with the aim of reducing the cold start and significantly improving the performance of Lambda functions with Java. Starting from a system that involves AWS lambda, java, DynamoDB and Api Gateway. Each approach will be tested independently, analyzing its impact through load tests. Subsequently, they will be tested in combination in an effort to achieve the greatest possible performance improvement.

**ABSTRACT**  
API misuses often lead to software bugs, crashes, and vulnerabilities. While several API misuse detectors have been proposed, there are no automatic repair tools specifically designed for this purpose. In a recent study, test-suite-based automatic program repair (APR) tools were found to be ineffective in repairing API misuses. Still, since the study focused on non-learning-aided APR tools, it remains unknown whether learning-aided APR tools are capable of fixing API misuses. In recent years, pre-trained language models (PLMs) have succeeded greatly in many natural language processing tasks. There is a rising interest in applying PLMs to APR. However, there has not been any study that investigates the effectiveness of PLMs in repairing API misuse.   To fill this gap, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study on 11 learning-aided APR tools, which include 9 of the state-of-the-art general-purpose PLMs and two APR tools. We evaluate these models with an API-misuse repair dataset, consisting of two variants. Our results show that PLMs perform better than the studied APR tools in repairing API misuses. Among the 9 pre-trained models tested, CodeT5 is the best performer in the exact match. We also offer insights and potential exploration directions for future research.

**ABSTRACT**  
Large language model (LLM) applications in cloud root cause analysis (RCA) have been actively explored recently. However, current methods are still reliant on manual workflow settings and do not unleash LLMs' decision-making and environment interaction capabilities. We present RCAgent, a tool-augmented LLM autonomous agent framework for practical and privacy-aware industrial RCA usage. Running on an internally deployed model rather than GPT families, RCAgent is capable of free-form data collection and comprehensive analysis with tools. Our framework combines a variety of enhancements, including a unique Self-Consistency for action trajectories, and a suite of methods for context management, stabilization, and importing domain knowledge. Our experiments show RCAgent's evident and consistent superiority over ReAct across all aspects of RCA -- predicting root causes, solutions, evidence, and responsibilities -- and tasks covered or uncovered by current rules, as validated by both automated metrics and human evaluations. Furthermore, RCAgent has already been integrated into the diagnosis and issue discovery workflow of the Real-time Compute Platform for Apache Flink of Alibaba Cloud.

**ABSTRACT**  
Large language models (LLMs) have brought significant advancements to code generation, benefiting both novice and experienced developers. However, their training using unsanitized data from open-source repositories, like GitHub, introduces the risk of inadvertently propagating security vulnerabilities. To effectively mitigate this concern, this paper presents a comprehensive study focused on evaluating and enhancing code LLMs from a software security perspective. We introduce SecuCoGen\footnote{SecuCoGen has been uploaded as supplemental material and will be made publicly available after publication.}, a meticulously curated dataset targeting 21 critical vulnerability types. SecuCoGen comprises 180 samples and serves as the foundation for conducting experiments on three crucial code-related tasks: code generation, code repair and vulnerability classification, with a strong emphasis on security. Our experimental results reveal that existing models often overlook security concerns during code generation, leading to the generation of vulnerable code. To address this, we propose effective approaches to mitigate the security vulnerabilities and enhance the overall robustness of code generated by LLMs. Moreover, our study identifies weaknesses in existing models' ability to repair vulnerable code, even when provided with vulnerability information. Additionally, certain vulnerability types pose challenges for the models, hindering their performance in vulnerability classification. Based on these findings, we believe our study will have a positive impact on the software engineering community, inspiring the development of improved methods for training and utilizing LLMs, thereby leading to safer and more trustworthy model deployment.

**ABSTRACT**  
With the growing interest on Large Language Models (LLMs) for fault localization and program repair, ensuring the integrity and generalizability of the LLM-based methods becomes paramount. The code in existing widely-adopted benchmarks for these tasks was written before the the bloom of LLMs and may be included in the training data of existing popular LLMs, thereby suffering from the threat of data leakage, leading to misleadingly optimistic performance metrics. To address this issue, we introduce "ConDefects", a novel dataset of real faults meticulously curated to eliminate such overlap. ConDefects contains 1,254 Java faulty programs and 1,625 Python faulty programs. All these programs are sourced from the online competition platform AtCoder and were produced between October 2021 and September 2023. We pair each fault with fault locations and the corresponding repaired code versions, making it tailored for in fault localization and program repair related research. We also provide interfaces for selecting subsets based on different time windows and coding task difficulties. While inspired by LLM-based tasks, ConDefects can be adopted for benchmarking ALL types of fault localization and program repair methods. The dataset is publicly available, and a demo video can be found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22j15Hj5ONk.

**ABSTRACT**  
Trust is essential for our interactions with others but also with artificial intelligence (AI) based systems. To understand whether a user trusts an AI, researchers need reliable measurement tools. However, currently discussed markers mostly rely on expensive and invasive sensors, like electroencephalograms, which may cause discomfort. The analysis of gaze data has been suggested as a convenient tool for trust assessment. However, the relationship between trust and several aspects of the gaze behaviour is not yet fully understood. To provide more insights into this relationship, we propose a exploration study in virtual reality where participants have to perform a sorting task together with a simulated AI in a simulated robotic arm embedded in a gaming. We discuss the potential benefits of this approach and outline our study design in this submission.

To provide more insights into this relationship, we asked participants (n = 146) to rate whether several tweets were offensive while an AI suggested its assessment. Our results reveal which aspects of the mouse trajectory are affected by the users subjective trust and confidence ratings; yet they indicate that these measures might not explain sufficiently the variance to be used on their own. This work examines a potential low-cost trust assessment in AI systems.

**ABSTRACT**  
Reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely applied in recommendation systems due to its potential in optimizing the long-term engagement of users. From the perspective of RL, recommendation can be formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP), where recommendation system (agent) can interact with users (environment) and acquire feedback (reward signals).However, it is impractical to conduct online interactions with the concern on user experience and implementation complexity, and we can only train RL recommenders with offline datasets containing limited reward signals and state transitions. Therefore, the data sparsity issue of reward signals and state transitions is very severe, while it has long been overlooked by existing RL recommenders.Worse still, RL methods learn through the trial-and-error mode, but negative feedback cannot be obtained in implicit feedback recommendation tasks, which aggravates the overestimation problem of offline RL recommender. To address these challenges, we propose a novel RL recommender named model-enhanced contrastive reinforcement learning (MCRL). On the one hand, we learn a value function to estimate the long-term engagement of users, together with a conservative value learning mechanism to alleviate the overestimation problem.On the other hand, we construct some positive and negative state-action pairs to model the reward function and state transition function with contrastive learning to exploit the internal structure information of MDP. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing offline RL and self-supervised RL methods with different representative backbone networks on two real-world datasets.

**ABSTRACT**  
Path reasoning methods over knowledge graphs have gained popularity for their potential to improve transparency in recommender systems. However, the resulting models still rely on pre-trained knowledge graph embeddings, fail to fully exploit the interdependence between entities and relations in the KG for recommendation, and may generate inaccurate explanations. In this paper, we introduce PEARLM, a novel approach that efficiently captures user behaviour and product-side knowledge through language modelling. With our approach, knowledge graph embeddings are directly learned from paths over the KG by the language model, which also unifies entities and relations in the same optimisation space. Constraints on the sequence decoding additionally guarantee path faithfulness with respect to the KG. Experiments on two datasets show the effectiveness of our approach compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Source code and datasets: AVAILABLE AFTER GETTING ACCEPTED.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recommendation system (RS) plays significant roles in matching users information needs for Internet applications, and it usually utilizes the vanilla neural network as the backbone to handle embedding details. Recently, the large language model (LLM) has exhibited emergent abilities and achieved great breakthroughs both in the CV and NLP communities. Thus, it is logical to incorporate RS with LLM better, which has become an emerging research direction. Although some existing works have made their contributions to this issue, they mainly consider the single key situation (e.g. historical interactions), especially in sequential recommendation. The situation of multiple key-value data is simply neglected. This significant scenario is mainstream in real practical applications, where the information of users (e.g. age, occupation, etc) and items (e.g. title, category, etc) has more than one key. Therefore, we aim to implement sequential recommendations based on multiple key-value data by incorporating RS with LLM. In particular, we instruct tuning a prevalent open-source LLM (Llama 7B) in order to inject domain knowledge of RS into the pre-trained LLM. Since we adopt multiple key-value strategies, LLM is hard to learn well among these keys. Thus the general and innovative shuffle and mask strategies, as an innovative manner of data argument, are designed. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, extensive experiments are conducted on the popular and suitable dataset MovieLens which contains multiple keys-value.

**ABSTRACT**  
Incorporating fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) into the inference process of a convolutional neural network (CNN) draws enormous attention as a viable approach for achieving private inference (PI). FHE allows delegating the entire computation process to the server while ensuring the confidentiality of sensitive client-side data. However, practical FHE implementation of a CNN faces significant hurdles, primarily due to FHE's substantial computational and memory overhead. To address these challenges, we propose a set of optimizations, which includes GPU/ASIC acceleration, an efficient activation function, and an optimized packing scheme. We evaluate our method using the ResNet models on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets, achieving several orders of magnitude improvement compared to prior work and reducing the latency of the encrypted CNN inference to 1.4 seconds on an NVIDIA A100 GPU. We also show that the latency drops to a mere 0.03 seconds with a custom hardware design.

**ABSTRACT**  
Signed graph neural networks (SGNNs) has recently drawn more attention as many real-world networks are signed networks containing two types of edges: positive and negative. The existence of negative edges affects the SGNN robustness on two aspects. One is the semantic imbalance as the negative edges are usually hard to obtain though they can provide potentially useful information. The other is the structural unbalance, e.g. unbalanced triangles, an indication of incompatible relationship among nodes. In this paper, we propose a balancing augmentation method to address the above two aspects for SGNNs. Firstly, the utility of each negative edge is measured by calculating its occurrence in unbalanced structures. Secondly, the original signed graph is selectively augmented with the use of (1) an edge perturbation regulator to balance the number of positive and negative edges and to determine the ratio of perturbed edges to original edges and (2) an edge utility filter to remove the negative edges with low utility to make the graph structure more balanced. Finally, a SGNN is trained on the augmented graph which effectively explores the credible relationships. A detailed theoretical analysis is also conducted to prove the effectiveness of each module. Experiments on five real-world datasets in link prediction demonstrate that our method has the advantages of effectiveness and generalization and can significantly improve the performance of SGNN backbones.

**ABSTRACT**  
Learned image compression (LIC) has gained traction as an effective solution for image storage and transmission in recent years. However, existing LIC methods are redundant in latent representation due to limitations in capturing anisotropic frequency components and preserving directional details. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel frequency-aware transformer (FAT) block that for the first time achieves multiscale directional ananlysis for LIC. The FAT block comprises frequency-decomposition window attention (FDWA) modules to capture multiscale and directional frequency components of natural images. Additionally, we introduce frequency-modulation feed-forward network (FMFFN) to adaptively modulate different frequency components, improving rate-distortion performance. Furthermore, we present a transformer-based channel-wise autoregressive (T-CA) model that effectively exploits channel dependencies. Experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance compared to existing LIC methods, and evidently outperforms latest standardized codec VTM-12.1 by 14.5%, 15.1%, 13.0% in BD-rate on the Kodak, Tecnick, and CLIC datasets.

**ABSTRACT**  
The Mean-Field approximation is a tractable approach for studying large population dynamics. However, its assumption on homogeneity and universal connections among all agents limits its applicability in many real-world scenarios. Multi-Population Mean-Field Game (MP-MFG) models have been introduced in the literature to address these limitations. When the underlying Stochastic Block Model is known, we show that a Policy Mirror Ascent algorithm finds the MP-MFG Nash Equilibrium. In more realistic scenarios where the block model is unknown, we propose a re-sampling scheme from a graphon integrated with the finite N-player MP-MFG model. We develop a novel learning framework based on a Graphon Game with Re-Sampling (GGR-S) model, which captures the complex network structures of agents' connections. We analyze GGR-S dynamics and establish the convergence to dynamics of MP-MFG. Leveraging this result, we propose an efficient sample-based N-player Reinforcement Learning algorithm for GGR-S without population manipulation, and provide a rigorous convergence analysis with finite sample guarantee.

**ABSTRACT**  
Matrix computation units have been equipped in current architectures to accelerate AI and high performance computing applications. The matrix multiplication and vector outer product are two basic instruction types. The latter one is lighter since the inputs are vectors. Thus it provides more opportunities to develop flexible algorithms for problems other than dense linear algebra computing and more possibilities to optimize the implementation. Stencil computations represent a common class of nested loops in scientific and engineering applications. This paper proposes a novel stencil algorithm using vector outer products. Unlike previous work, the new algorithm arises from the stencil definition in the scatter mode and is initially expressed with formulas of vector outer products. The implementation incorporates a set of optimizations to improve the memory reference pattern, execution pipeline and data reuse by considering various algorithmic options and the data sharing between input vectors. Evaluation on a simulator shows that our design achieves a substantial speedup compared with vectorized stencil algorithm.
