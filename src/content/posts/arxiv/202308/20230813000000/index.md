**ABSTRACT**  
Recent studies show promising performance in open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) using pseudo labels (PLs) from pretrained vision and language models (VLMs). However, PLs generated by VLMs are extremely noisy due to the gap between the pretraining objective of VLMs and OVD, which blocks further advances on PLs. In this paper, we aim to reduce the noise in PLs and propose a method called online Self-training And a Split-and-fusion head for OVD (SAS-Det). First, the self-training finetunes VLMs to generate high quality PLs while prevents forgetting the knowledge learned in the pretraining. Second, a split-and-fusion (SAF) head is designed to remove the noise in localization of PLs, which is usually ignored in existing methods. It also fuses complementary knowledge learned from both precise ground truth and noisy pseudo labels to boost the performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate SAS-Det is both efficient and effective. Our pseudo labeling is 3 times faster than prior methods. SAS-Det outperforms prior state-of-the-art models of the same scale by a clear margin and achieves 37.4 AP$_{50}$ and 27.3 AP$_r$ on novel categories of the COCO and LVIS benchmarks, respectively.

**ABSTRACT**  
Instruction tuned Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have made significant advancements in generalizing across a diverse set of multimodal tasks, especially for Visual Question Answering (VQA). However, generating detailed responses that are visually grounded is still a challenging task for these models. We find that even the current state-of-the-art LVLMs (InstructBLIP) still contain a staggering 30 percent of hallucinatory text in the form of non-existent objects, unfaithful descriptions, and inaccurate relationships. To address this, we introduce M-HalDetect, a {M}ultimodal {Hal}lucination {Detect}ion Dataset that can be used to train and benchmark models for hallucination detection and prevention. M-HalDetect consists of 16k fine-grained labels on VQA examples, making it the first comprehensive multi-modal hallucination detection dataset for detailed image descriptions. Unlike previous work that only consider object hallucination, we additionally annotate both entity descriptions and relationships that are unfaithful. To demonstrate the potential of this dataset for preference alignment, we propose fine-grained Direct Preference Optimization, as well as train fine-grained multi-modal reward models and evaluate their effectiveness with best-of-n rejection sampling. We perform human evaluation on both DPO and rejection sampling, and find that they reduce hallucination rates by 41% and 55% respectively, a significant improvement over the baseline.

**ABSTRACT**  
Semantic understanding of roadways is a key enabling factor for safe autonomous driving. However, existing autonomous driving datasets provide well-structured urban roads while ignoring unstructured roadways containing distress, potholes, water puddles, and various kinds of road patches i.e., earthen, gravel etc. To this end, we introduce Road Region Segmentation dataset (R2S100K) -- a large-scale dataset and benchmark for training and evaluation of road segmentation in aforementioned challenging unstructured roadways. R2S100K comprises 100K images extracted from a large and diverse set of video sequences covering more than 1000 KM of roadways. Out of these 100K privacy respecting images, 14,000 images have fine pixel-labeling of road regions, with 86,000 unlabeled images that can be leveraged through semi-supervised learning methods. Alongside, we present an Efficient Data Sampling (EDS) based self-training framework to improve learning by leveraging unlabeled data. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves learning methods in generalizability and reduces the labeling cost for semantic segmentation tasks. Our benchmark will be publicly available to facilitate future research at https://r2s100k.github.io/.

**ABSTRACT**  
The field of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) aims to uncover the inner workings of complex deep neural models. While being crucial for safety-critical domains, XAI inherently lacks ground-truth explanations, making its automatic evaluation an unsolved problem. We address this challenge by proposing a novel synthetic vision dataset, named FunnyBirds, and accompanying automatic evaluation protocols. Our dataset allows performing semantically meaningful image interventions, e.g., removing individual object parts, which has three important implications. First, it enables analyzing explanations on a part level, which is closer to human comprehension than existing methods that evaluate on a pixel level. Second, by comparing the model output for inputs with removed parts, we can estimate ground-truth part importances that should be reflected in the explanations. Third, by mapping individual explanations into a common space of part importances, we can analyze a variety of different explanation types in a single common framework. Using our tools, we report results for 24 different combinations of neural models and XAI methods, demonstrating the strengths and weaknesses of the assessed methods in a fully automatic and systematic manner.

**ABSTRACT**  
Complex emotion recognition is a cognitive task that has so far eluded the same excellent performance of other tasks that are at or above the level of human cognition. Emotion recognition through facial expressions is particularly difficult due to the complexity of emotions expressed by the human face. For a machine to approach the same level of performance in this domain as a human, it may need to synthesise knowledge and understand new concepts in real-time as humans do. Humans are able to learn new concepts using only few examples, by distilling the important information from memories and discarding the rest. Similarly, continual learning methods learn new classes whilst retaining the knowledge of known classes, whilst few-shot learning methods are able to learn new classes using very few training examples. We propose a novel continual learning method inspired by human cognition and learning that can accurately recognise new compound expression classes using few training samples, by building on and retaining its knowledge of basic expression classes. Using GradCAM visualisations, we demonstrate the relationship between basic and compound facial expressions, which our method leverages through knowledge distillation and a novel Predictive Sorting Memory Replay. Our method achieves the current state-of-the-art in continual learning for complex facial expression recognition with 74.28% Overall Accuracy on new classes. We also demonstrate that using continual learning for complex facial expression recognition achieves far better performance than non-continual learning methods, improving on state-of-the-art non-continual learning methods by 13.95%. To the best of our knowledge, our work is also the first to apply few-shot learning to complex facial expression recognition, achieving the state-of-the-art with 100% accuracy using a single training sample for each expression class.

**ABSTRACT**  
Weakly supervised object localization (WSOL) is one of the most popular and challenging tasks in computer vision. This task is to localize the objects in the images given only the image-level supervision. Recently, dividing WSOL into two parts (class-agnostic object localization and object classification) has become the state-of-the-art pipeline for this task. However, existing solutions under this pipeline usually suffer from the following drawbacks: 1) they are not flexible since they can only localize one object for each image due to the adopted single-class regression (SCR) for localization; 2) the generated pseudo bounding boxes may be noisy, but the negative impact of such noise is not well addressed. To remedy these drawbacks, we first propose to replace SCR with a binary-class detector (BCD) for localizing multiple objects, where the detector is trained by discriminating the foreground and background. Then we design a weighted entropy (WE) loss using the unlabeled data to reduce the negative impact of noisy bounding boxes. Extensive experiments on the popular CUB-200-2011 and ImageNet-1K datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

**ABSTRACT**  
Latest methods for visual counterfactual explanations (VCE) harness the power of deep generative models to synthesize new examples of high-dimensional images of impressive quality. However, it is currently difficult to compare the performance of these VCE methods as the evaluation procedures largely vary and often boil down to visual inspection of individual examples and small scale user studies. In this work, we propose a framework for systematic, quantitative evaluation of the VCE methods and a minimal set of metrics to be used. We use this framework to explore the effects of certain crucial design choices in the latest diffusion-based generative models for VCEs of natural image classification (ImageNet). We conduct a battery of ablation-like experiments, generating thousands of VCEs for a suite of classifiers of various complexity, accuracy and robustness. Our findings suggest multiple directions for future advancements and improvements of VCE methods. By sharing our methodology and our approach to tackle the computational challenges of such a study on a limited hardware setup (including the complete code base), we offer a valuable guidance for researchers in the field fostering consistency and transparency in the assessment of counterfactual explanations.

**ABSTRACT**  
Structural re-parameterization is a general training scheme for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which achieves performance improvement without increasing inference cost. As Vision Transformers (ViTs) are gradually surpassing CNNs in various visual tasks, one may question: if a training scheme specifically for ViTs exists that can also achieve performance improvement without increasing inference cost? Recently, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has attracted increasing attention, as it can efficiently scale up the capacity of Transformers at a fixed cost through sparsely activated experts. Considering that MoE can also be viewed as a multi-branch structure, can we utilize MoE to implement a ViT training scheme similar to structural re-parameterization? In this paper, we affirmatively answer these questions, with a new general training strategy for ViTs. Specifically, we decouple the training and inference phases of ViTs. During training, we replace some Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs) of the ViT with specially designed, more efficient MoEs that assign tokens to experts by random uniform partition, and perform Experts Weights Averaging (EWA) on these MoEs at the end of each iteration. After training, we convert each MoE into an FFN by averaging the experts, transforming the model back into original ViT for inference. We further provide a theoretical analysis to show why and how it works. Comprehensive experiments across various 2D and 3D visual tasks, ViT architectures, and datasets validate the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed training scheme. Besides, our training scheme can also be applied to improve performance when fine-tuning ViTs. Lastly, but equally important, the proposed EWA technique can significantly improve the effectiveness of naive MoE in various 2D visual small datasets and 3D visual tasks.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper presents a computer-aided cytology diagnosis system designed for animals, focusing on image quality assessment (IQA) using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The system's building blocks are tailored to seamlessly integrate IQA, ensuring reliable performance in disease classification. We extensively investigate the CNN's ability to handle various image variations and scenarios, analyzing the impact on detecting low-quality input data. Additionally, the network's capacity to differentiate valid cellular samples from those with artifacts is evaluated. Our study employs a ResNet18 network architecture and explores the effects of input sizes and cropping strategies on model performance. The research sheds light on the significance of CNN-based IQA in computer-aided cytology diagnosis for animals, enhancing the accuracy of disease classification.

**ABSTRACT**  
Benefiting from prompt tuning, recent years have witnessed the promising performance of pre-trained vision-language models, e.g., CLIP, on versatile downstream tasks. In this paper, we focus on a particular setting of learning adaptive prompts on the fly for each test sample from an unseen new domain, which is known as test-time prompt tuning (TPT). Existing TPT methods typically rely on data augmentation and confidence selection. However, conventional data augmentation techniques, e.g., random resized crops, suffers from the lack of data diversity, while entropy-based confidence selection alone is not sufficient to guarantee prediction fidelity. To address these issues, we propose a novel TPT method, named DiffTPT, which leverages pre-trained diffusion models to generate diverse and informative new data. Specifically, we incorporate augmented data by both conventional method and pre-trained stable diffusion to exploit their respective merits, improving the models ability to adapt to unknown new test data. Moreover, to ensure the prediction fidelity of generated data, we introduce a cosine similarity-based filtration technique to select the generated data with higher similarity to the single test sample. Our experiments on test datasets with distribution shifts and unseen categories demonstrate that DiffTPT improves the zero-shot accuracy by an average of 5.13\% compared to the state-of-the-art TPT method. Our code and models will be publicly released.

**ABSTRACT**  
Text-to-image synthesis has achieved high-quality results with recent advances in diffusion models. However, text input alone has high spatial ambiguity and limited user controllability. Most existing methods allow spatial control through additional visual guidance (e.g, sketches and semantic masks) but require additional training with annotated images. In this paper, we propose a method for spatially controlling text-to-image generation without further training of diffusion models. Our method is based on the insight that the cross-attention maps reflect the positional relationship between words and pixels. Our aim is to control the attention maps according to given semantic masks and text prompts. To this end, we first explore a simple approach of directly swapping the cross-attention maps with constant maps computed from the semantic regions. Moreover, we propose masked-attention guidance, which can generate images more faithful to semantic masks than the first approach. Masked-attention guidance indirectly controls attention to each word and pixel according to the semantic regions by manipulating noise images fed to diffusion models. Experiments show that our method enables more accurate spatial control than baselines qualitatively and quantitatively.

**ABSTRACT**  
Efficient RGB-D semantic segmentation has received considerable attention in mobile robots, which plays a vital role in analyzing and recognizing environmental information. According to previous studies, depth information can provide corresponding geometric relationships for objects and scenes, but actual depth data usually exist as noise. To avoid unfavorable effects on segmentation accuracy and computation, it is necessary to design an efficient framework to leverage cross-modal correlations and complementary cues. In this paper, we propose an efficient lightweight encoder-decoder network that reduces the computational parameters and guarantees the robustness of the algorithm. Working with channel and spatial fusion attention modules, our network effectively captures multi-level RGB-D features. A globally guided local affinity context module is proposed to obtain sufficient high-level context information. The decoder utilizes a lightweight residual unit that combines short- and long-distance information with a few redundant computations. Experimental results on NYUv2, SUN RGB-D, and Cityscapes datasets show that our method achieves a better trade-off among segmentation accuracy, inference time, and parameters than the state-of-the-art methods.

**ABSTRACT**  
Deep neural networks are vulnerable to universal adversarial perturbation (UAP), an instance-agnostic perturbation capable of fooling the target model for most samples. Compared to instance-specific adversarial examples, UAP is more challenging as it needs to generalize across various samples and models. In this paper, we examine the serious dilemma of UAP generation methods from a generalization perspective -- the gradient vanishing problem using small-batch stochastic gradient optimization and the local optima problem using large-batch optimization. To address these problems, we propose a simple and effective method called Stochastic Gradient Aggregation (SGA), which alleviates the gradient vanishing and escapes from poor local optima at the same time. Specifically, SGA employs the small-batch training to perform multiple iterations of inner pre-search. Then, all the inner gradients are aggregated as a one-step gradient estimation to enhance the gradient stability and reduce quantization errors. Extensive experiments on the standard ImageNet dataset demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the generalization ability of UAP and outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at https://github.com/liuxuannan/Stochastic-Gradient-Aggregation.

**ABSTRACT**  
The video grounding (VG) task aims to locate the queried action or event in an untrimmed video based on rich linguistic descriptions. Existing proposal-free methods are trapped in complex interaction between video and query, overemphasizing cross-modal feature fusion and feature correlation for VG. In this paper, we propose a novel boundary regression paradigm that performs regression token learning in a transformer. Particularly, we present a simple but effective proposal-free framework, namely Video Grounding Transformer (ViGT), which predicts the temporal boundary using a learnable regression token rather than multi-modal or cross-modal features. In ViGT, the benefits of a learnable token are manifested as follows. (1) The token is unrelated to the video or the query and avoids data bias toward the original video and query. (2) The token simultaneously performs global context aggregation from video and query features. First, we employed a sharing feature encoder to project both video and query into a joint feature space before performing cross-modal co-attention (i.e., video-to-query attention and query-to-video attention) to highlight discriminative features in each modality. Furthermore, we concatenated a learnable regression token [REG] with the video and query features as the input of a vision-language transformer. Finally, we utilized the token [REG] to predict the target moment and visual features to constrain the foreground and background probabilities at each timestamp. The proposed ViGT performed well on three public datasets: ANet Captions, TACoS and YouCookII. Extensive ablation studies and qualitative analysis further validated the interpretability of ViGT.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recent progress in weakly supervised object detection is featured by a combination of multiple instance detection networks (MIDN) and ordinal online refinement. However, with only image-level annotation, MIDN inevitably assigns high scores to some unexpected region proposals when generating pseudo labels. These inaccurate high-scoring region proposals will mislead the training of subsequent refinement modules and thus hamper the detection performance. In this work, we explore how to ameliorate the quality of pseudo-labeling in MIDN. Formally, we devise Cyclic-Bootstrap Labeling (CBL), a novel weakly supervised object detection pipeline, which optimizes MIDN with rank information from a reliable teacher network. Specifically, we obtain this teacher network by introducing a weighted exponential moving average strategy to take advantage of various refinement modules. A novel class-specific ranking distillation algorithm is proposed to leverage the output of weighted ensembled teacher network for distilling MIDN with rank information. As a result, MIDN is guided to assign higher scores to accurate proposals among their neighboring ones, thus benefiting the subsequent pseudo labeling. Extensive experiments on the prevalent PASCAL VOC 2007 \& 2012 and COCO datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our CBL framework. Code will be available at https://github.com/Yinyf0804/WSOD-CBL/.

**ABSTRACT**  
Deploying 3D detectors in unfamiliar domains has been demonstrated to result in a drastic drop of up to 70-90% in detection rate due to variations in lidar, geographical region, or weather conditions from their original training dataset. This domain gap leads to missing detections for densely observed objects, misaligned confidence scores, and increased high-confidence false positives, rendering the detector highly unreliable. To address this, we introduce MS3D++, a self-training framework for multi-source unsupervised domain adaptation in 3D object detection. MS3D++ provides a straightforward approach to domain adaptation by generating high-quality pseudo-labels, enabling the adaptation of 3D detectors to a diverse range of lidar types, regardless of their density. Our approach effectively fuses predictions of an ensemble of multi-frame pre-trained detectors from different source domains to improve domain generalization. We subsequently refine the predictions temporally to ensure temporal consistency in box localization and object classification. Furthermore, we present an in-depth study into the performance and idiosyncrasies of various 3D detector components in a cross-domain context, providing valuable insights for improved cross-domain detector ensembling. Experimental results on Waymo, nuScenes and Lyft demonstrate that detectors trained with MS3D++ pseudo-labels achieve state-of-the-art performance, comparable to training with human-annotated labels in Bird's Eye View (BEV) evaluation for both low and high density lidar.

**ABSTRACT**  
Human-object interaction (HOI) detection is an important part of understanding human activities and visual scenes. The long-tailed distribution of labeled instances is a primary challenge in HOI detection, promoting research in few-shot and zero-shot learning. Inspired by the combinatorial nature of HOI triplets, some existing approaches adopt the idea of compositional learning, in which object and action features are learned individually and re-composed as new training samples. However, these methods follow the CNN-based two-stage paradigm with limited feature extraction ability, and often rely on auxiliary information for better performance. Without introducing any additional information, we creatively propose a transformer-based framework for compositional HOI learning. Human-object pair representations and interaction representations are re-composed across different HOI instances, which involves richer contextual information and promotes the generalization of knowledge. Experiments show our simple but effective method achieves state-of-the-art performance, especially on rare HOI classes.

**ABSTRACT**  
In recent years, sketch-based 3D shape retrieval has attracted growing attention. While many previous studies have focused on cross-modal matching between hand-drawn sketches and 3D shapes, the critical issue of how to handle low-quality and noisy samples in sketch data has been largely neglected. This paper presents an uncertainty-aware cross-modal transfer network (UACTN) that addresses this issue. UACTN decouples the representation learning of sketches and 3D shapes into two separate tasks: classification-based sketch uncertainty learning and 3D shape feature transfer. We first introduce an end-to-end classification-based approach that simultaneously learns sketch features and uncertainty, allowing uncertainty to prevent overfitting noisy sketches by assigning different levels of importance to clean and noisy sketches. Then, 3D shape features are mapped into the pre-learned sketch embedding space for feature alignment. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on two benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method compared to state-of-the-art methods.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper introduces a novel approach to detour management in Urban Air Traffic Management (UATM) using knowledge representation and reasoning. It aims to understand the complexities and requirements of UAM detours, enabling a method that quickly identifies safe and efficient routes in a carefully sampled environment. This method implemented in Answer Set Programming uses non-monotonic reasoning and a two-phase conversation between a human manager and the UATM system, considering factors like safety and potential impacts. The robustness and efficacy of the proposed method were validated through several queries from two simulation scenarios, contributing to the symbiosis of human knowledge and advanced AI techniques. The paper provides an introduction, citing relevant studies, problem formulation, solution, discussions, and concluding comments.

**ABSTRACT**  
Large Language Models (LLMs) have taken Knowledge Representation -- and the world -- by storm. This inflection point marks a shift from explicit knowledge representation to a renewed focus on the hybrid representation of both explicit knowledge and parametric knowledge. In this position paper, we will discuss some of the common debate points within the community on LLMs (parametric knowledge) and Knowledge Graphs (explicit knowledge) and speculate on opportunities and visions that the renewed focus brings, as well as related research topics and challenges.

**ABSTRACT**  
Identifying logical errors in complex, incomplete or even contradictory and overall heterogeneous data like students' experimentation protocols is challenging. Recognizing the limitations of current evaluation methods, we investigate the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) for automatically identifying student errors and streamlining teacher assessments. Our aim is to provide a foundation for productive, personalized feedback. Using a dataset of 65 student protocols, an Artificial Intelligence (AI) system based on the GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 series was developed and tested against human raters. Our results indicate varying levels of accuracy in error detection between the AI system and human raters. The AI system can accurately identify many fundamental student errors, for instance, the AI system identifies when a student is focusing the hypothesis not on the dependent variable but solely on an expected observation (acc. = 0.90), when a student modifies the trials in an ongoing investigation (acc. = 1), and whether a student is conducting valid test trials (acc. = 0.82) reliably. The identification of other, usually more complex errors, like whether a student conducts a valid control trial (acc. = .60), poses a greater challenge. This research explores not only the utility of AI in educational settings, but also contributes to the understanding of the capabilities of LLMs in error detection in inquiry-based learning like experimentation.

**ABSTRACT**  
In learning to defer, a predictor identifies risky decisions and defers them to a human expert. One key issue with this setup is that the expert may end up over-relying on the machine's decisions, due to anchoring bias. At the same time, whenever the machine chooses the deferral option the expert has to take decisions entirely unassisted. As a remedy, we propose learning to guide (LTG), an alternative framework in which -- rather than suggesting ready-made decisions -- the machine provides guidance useful to guide decision-making, and the human is entirely responsible for coming up with a decision. We also introduce SLOG, an LTG implementation that leverages (a small amount of) human supervision to convert a generic large language model into a module capable of generating textual guidance, and present preliminary but promising results on a medical diagnosis task.

**ABSTRACT**  
The advanced language processing abilities of large language models (LLMs) have stimulated debate over their capacity to replicate human-like cognitive processes. One differentiating factor between language processing in LLMs and humans is that language input is often grounded in more than one perceptual modality, whereas most LLMs process solely text-based information. Multimodal grounding allows humans to integrate - e.g. visual context with linguistic information and thereby place constraints on the space of upcoming words, reducing cognitive load and improving perception and comprehension. Recent multimodal LLMs (mLLMs) combine visual and linguistic embedding spaces with a transformer type attention mechanism for next-word prediction. To what extent does predictive language processing based on multimodal input align in mLLMs and humans? To answer this question, 200 human participants watched short audio-visual clips and estimated the predictability of an upcoming verb or noun. The same clips were processed by the mLLM CLIP, with predictability scores based on a comparison of image and text feature vectors. Eye-tracking was used to estimate what visual features participants attended to, and CLIP's visual attention weights were recorded. We find that human estimates of predictability align significantly with CLIP scores, but not for a unimodal LLM of comparable parameter size. Further, alignment vanished when CLIP's visual attention weights were perturbed, and when the same input was fed to a multimodal model without attention. Analysing attention patterns, we find a significant spatial overlap between CLIP's visual attention weights and human eye-tracking data. Results suggest that comparable processes of integrating multimodal information, guided by attention to relevant visual features, supports predictive language processing in mLLMs and humans.

**ABSTRACT**  
Large Language Models (LLMs) could enhance access to the legal system. However, empirical research on their effectiveness in conducting legal tasks is scant. We study securities cases involving cryptocurrencies as one of numerous contexts where AI could support the legal process, studying LLMs' legal reasoning and drafting capabilities. We examine whether a) an LLM can accurately determine which laws are potentially being violated from a fact pattern, and b) whether there is a difference in juror decision-making based on complaints written by a lawyer compared to an LLM. We feed fact patterns from real-life cases to GPT-3.5 and evaluate its ability to determine correct potential violations from the scenario and exclude spurious violations. Second, we had mock jurors assess complaints written by the LLM and lawyers. GPT-3.5's legal reasoning skills proved weak, though we expect improvement in future models, particularly given the violations it suggested tended to be correct (it merely missed additional, correct violations). GPT-3.5 performed better at legal drafting, and jurors' decisions were not statistically significantly associated with the author of the document upon which they based their decisions. Because LLMs cannot satisfactorily conduct legal reasoning tasks, they would be unable to replace lawyers at this stage. However, their drafting skills (though, perhaps, still inferior to lawyers), could provide access to justice for more individuals by reducing the cost of legal services. Our research is the first to systematically study LLMs' legal drafting and reasoning capabilities in litigation, as well as in securities law and cryptocurrency-related misconduct.

**ABSTRACT**  
Robust pedestrian trajectory forecasting is crucial to developing safe autonomous vehicles. Although previous works have studied adversarial robustness in the context of trajectory forecasting, some significant issues remain unaddressed. In this work, we try to tackle these crucial problems. Firstly, the previous definitions of robustness in trajectory prediction are ambiguous. We thus provide formal definitions for two kinds of robustness, namely label robustness and pure robustness. Secondly, as previous works fail to consider robustness about all points in a disturbance interval, we utilise a probably approximately correct (PAC) framework for robustness verification. Additionally, this framework can not only identify potential counterexamples, but also provides interpretable analyses of the original methods. Our approach is applied using a prototype tool named TrajPAC. With TrajPAC, we evaluate the robustness of four state-of-the-art trajectory prediction models -- Trajectron++, MemoNet, AgentFormer, and MID -- on trajectories from five scenes of the ETH/UCY dataset and scenes of the Stanford Drone Dataset. Using our framework, we also experimentally study various factors that could influence robustness performance.

**ABSTRACT**  
Multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) is a critical field in many large-scale robotic applications, often being the fundamental step in multi-agent systems. The increasing complexity of MAPF in complex and crowded environments, however, critically diminishes the effectiveness of existing solutions. In contrast to other studies that have either presented a general overview of the recent advancements in MAPF or extensively reviewed Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) within multi-agent system settings independently, our work presented in this review paper focuses on highlighting the integration of DRL-based approaches in MAPF. Moreover, we aim to bridge the current gap in evaluating MAPF solutions by addressing the lack of unified evaluation metrics and providing comprehensive clarification on these metrics. Finally, our paper discusses the potential of model-based DRL as a promising future direction and provides its required foundational understanding to address current challenges in MAPF. Our objective is to assist readers in gaining insight into the current research direction, providing unified metrics for comparing different MAPF algorithms and expanding their knowledge of model-based DRL to address the existing challenges in MAPF.

**ABSTRACT**  
User quality of experience in the context of Web browsing is being researched widely, with plenty of developments occurring alongside technological advances, not seldom driven by big industry players. With the huge reach and infrastructure of Google, the Chrome User Experience Report (CrUX) provides quantitative real-life measurement data of a vast magnitude. Analysis of this steadily expanding dataset aggregating different user experience metrics, yields tangible insights into actual trends and developments. Hence, this paper is the first to study the CrUX dataset from the viewpoint of relevant metrics by quantitative evaluation of users Web browsing experience across three device types and nine European countries. Analysis of data segmented by connection type in the device dimension shows desktops outperforming other device types for all metrics. Similar analysis in the country dimension, shows North European countries (Sweden, Finland) having maximum 4G connections (85.99%, 81.41% respectively) and steadily performing 25%-36% better at the 75th percentile across all metrics compared to the worst performing country. Such a high-level longitudinal analysis of real-life Web browsing experience provides an extensive base for future research.

**ABSTRACT**  
Analyzing network topologies and communication graphs plays a crucial role in contemporary network management. However, the absence of a cohesive approach leads to a challenging learning curve, heightened errors, and inefficiencies. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to facilitate a natural-language-based network management experience, utilizing large language models (LLMs) to generate task-specific code from natural language queries. This method tackles the challenges of explainability, scalability, and privacy by allowing network operators to inspect the generated code, eliminating the need to share network data with LLMs, and concentrating on application-specific requests combined with general program synthesis techniques. We design and evaluate a prototype system using benchmark applications, showcasing high accuracy, cost-effectiveness, and the potential for further enhancements using complementary program synthesis techniques.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recently, big artificial intelligence (AI) models represented by chatGPT have brought an incredible revolution. With the pre-trained big AI model (BAIM) in certain fields, numerous downstream tasks can be accomplished with only few-shot or even zero-shot learning and exhibit state-of-the-art performances. As widely envisioned, the big AI models are to rapidly penetrate into major intelligent services and applications, and are able to run at low unit cost and high flexibility. In 6G wireless networks, to fully enable intelligent communication, sensing and computing, apart from providing other intelligent wireless services and applications, it is of vital importance to design and deploy certain wireless BAIMs (wBAIMs). However, there still lacks investigation on architecture design and system evaluation for wBAIM. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive discussion as well as some in-depth prospects on the demand, design and deployment aspects of the wBAIM. We opine that wBAIM will be a recipe of the 6G wireless networks to build high-efficient, sustainable, versatile, and extensible wireless intelligence for numerous promising visions. Then, we present the core characteristics and principles to guide the design of wBAIMs, and discuss the key aspects of developing wBAIMs through identifying the differences between the existing BAIMs and the emerging wBAIMs. Finally, related research directions and potential solutions are outlined.

**ABSTRACT**  
While Large Language Models (LLMs) can solve many NLP tasks in zero-shot settings, applications involving embodied agents remain problematic. In particular, complex plans that require multi-step reasoning become difficult and too costly as the context window grows. Planning requires understanding the likely effects of one's actions and identifying whether the current environment satisfies the goal state. While symbolic planners find optimal solutions quickly, they require a complete and accurate representation of the planning problem, severely limiting their use in practical scenarios. In contrast, modern LLMs cope with noisy observations and high levels of uncertainty when reasoning about a task. Our work presents LLM Dynamic Planner (LLM-DP): a neuro-symbolic framework where an LLM works hand-in-hand with a traditional planner to solve an embodied task. Given action-descriptions, LLM-DP solves Alfworld faster and more efficiently than a naive LLM ReAct baseline.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this work, we address the problem of directing the text generations of a LLM towards a desired behavior, aligning the generated text with the preferences of the human operator. We propose using another language model as a critic, reward model in a zero-shot way thanks to the prompt of a Yes-No question that represents the user preferences, without requiring further labeled data. This zero-shot reward model provides the learning signal to further fine-tune the base LLM using reinforcement learning, as in RLAIF; yet our approach is also compatible in other contexts such as quality-diversity search. Extensive evidence of the capabilities of the proposed ZYN framework is provided through experiments in different domains related to text generation, including detoxification; optimizing sentiment of movie reviews, or any other attribute; steering the opinion about a particular topic the model may have; and personalizing prompt generators for text-to-image tasks.

**ABSTRACT**  
Social determinants of health (SDoH) have an important impact on patient outcomes but are incompletely collected from the electronic health records (EHR). This study researched the ability of large language models to extract SDoH from free text in EHRs, where they are most commonly documented, and explored the role of synthetic clinical text for improving the extraction of these scarcely documented, yet extremely valuable, clinical data. 800 patient notes were annotated for SDoH categories, and several transformer-based models were evaluated. The study also experimented with synthetic data generation and assessed for algorithmic bias. Our best-performing models were fine-tuned Flan-T5 XL (macro-F1 0.71) for any SDoH, and Flan-T5 XXL (macro-F1 0.70). The benefit of augmenting fine-tuning with synthetic data varied across model architecture and size, with smaller Flan-T5 models (base and large) showing the greatest improvements in performance (delta F1 +0.12 to +0.23). Model performance was similar on the in-hospital system dataset but worse on the MIMIC-III dataset. Our best-performing fine-tuned models outperformed zero- and few-shot performance of ChatGPT-family models for both tasks. These fine-tuned models were less likely than ChatGPT to change their prediction when race/ethnicity and gender descriptors were added to the text, suggesting less algorithmic bias (p<0.05). At the patient-level, our models identified 93.8% of patients with adverse SDoH, while ICD-10 codes captured 2.0%. Our method can effectively extracted SDoH information from clinic notes, performing better compare to GPT zero- and few-shot settings. These models could enhance real-world evidence on SDoH and aid in identifying patients needing social support.

**ABSTRACT**  
Reasoning ability is one of the most crucial capabilities of a foundation model, signifying its capacity to address complex reasoning tasks. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technique is widely regarded as one of the effective methods for enhancing the reasoning ability of foundation models and has garnered significant attention. However, the reasoning process of CoT is linear, step-by-step, similar to personal logical reasoning, suitable for solving general and slightly complicated problems. On the contrary, the thinking pattern of an expert owns two prominent characteristics that cannot be handled appropriately in CoT, i.e., high-order multi-hop reasoning and multimodal comparative judgement. Therefore, the core motivation of this paper is transcending CoT to construct a reasoning paradigm that can think like an expert. The hyperedge of a hypergraph could connect various vertices, making it naturally suitable for modelling high-order relationships. Inspired by this, this paper innovatively proposes a multimodal Hypergraph-of-Thought (HoT) reasoning paradigm, which enables the foundation models to possess the expert-level ability of high-order multi-hop reasoning and multimodal comparative judgement. Specifically, a textual hypergraph-of-thought is constructed utilizing triple as the primary thought to model higher-order relationships, and a hyperedge-of-thought is generated through multi-hop walking paths to achieve multi-hop inference. Furthermore, we devise a visual hypergraph-of-thought to interact with the textual hypergraph-of-thought via Cross-modal Co-Attention Graph Learning for multimodal comparative verification. Experimentations on the ScienceQA benchmark demonstrate the proposed HoT-based T5 outperforms CoT-based GPT3.5 and chatGPT, which is on par with CoT-based GPT4 with a lower model size.

**ABSTRACT**  
Free text comments (FTC) in patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) data are typically analysed using manual methods, such as content analysis, which is labour-intensive and time-consuming. Machine learning analysis methods are largely unsupervised, necessitating post-analysis interpretation. Weakly supervised text classification (WSTC) can be a valuable method of analysis to classify domain-specific text data in which there is limited labelled data. In this paper, we apply five WSTC techniques to FTC in PROMs data to identify health-related quality of life (HRQoL) themes reported by colorectal cancer patients. The WSTC methods label all the themes mentioned in the FTC. The results showed moderate performance on the PROMs data, mainly due to the precision of the models, and variation between themes. Evaluation of the classification performance illustrated the potential and limitations of keyword based WSTC to label PROMs FTC when labelled data is limited.

**ABSTRACT**  
Many hotels target guest acquisition efforts to specific markets in order to best anticipate individual preferences and needs of their guests. Likewise, such strategic positioning is a prerequisite for efficient marketing budget allocation. Official statistics report on the number of visitors from different countries, but no fine-grained information on the guest composition of individual businesses exists. There is, however, growing interest in such data from competitors, suppliers, researchers and the general public. We demonstrate how machine learning can be leveraged to extract references to guest nationalities from unstructured text reviews in order to dynamically assess and monitor the dynamics of guest composition of individual businesses. In particular, we show that a rather simple architecture of pre-trained embeddings and stacked LSTM layers provides a better performance-runtime tradeoff than more complex state-of-the-art language models.

Dialogue systems need to deal with the unpredictability of user intents to track dialogue state and the heterogeneity of slots to understand user preferences. In this paper we investigate the hypothesis that solving these challenges as one unified model will allow the transfer of parameter support data across the different tasks. The proposed principled model is based on a Transformer encoder, trained on multiple tasks, and leveraged by a rich input that conditions the model on the target inferences. Conditioning the Transformer encoder on multiple target inferences over the same corpus, i.e., intent and multiple slot types, allows learning richer language interactions than a single-task model would be able to. In fact, experimental results demonstrate that conditioning the model on an increasing number of dialogue inference tasks leads to improved results: on the MultiWOZ dataset, the joint intent and slot detection can be improved by 3.2\% by conditioning on intent, 10.8\% by conditioning on slot and 14.4\% by conditioning on both intent and slots. Moreover, on real conversations with Farfetch costumers, the proposed conditioned BERT can achieve high joint-goal and intent detection performance throughout a dialogue.

**ABSTRACT**  
Auditing financial documents is a very tedious and time-consuming process. As of today, it can already be simplified by employing AI-based solutions to recommend relevant text passages from a report for each legal requirement of rigorous accounting standards. However, these methods need to be fine-tuned regularly, and they require abundant annotated data, which is often lacking in industrial environments. Hence, we present ZeroShotALI, a novel recommender system that leverages a state-of-the-art large language model (LLM) in conjunction with a domain-specifically optimized transformer-based text-matching solution. We find that a two-step approach of first retrieving a number of best matching document sections per legal requirement with a custom BERT-based model and second filtering these selections using an LLM yields significant performance improvements over existing approaches.

**ABSTRACT**  
Generative language models (LMs) have become omnipresent across data science. For a wide variety of tasks, inputs can be phrased as natural language prompts for an LM, from whose output the solution can then be extracted. LM performance has consistently been increasing with model size - but so has the monetary cost of querying the ever larger models. Importantly, however, not all inputs are equally hard: some require larger LMs for obtaining a satisfactory solution, whereas for others smaller LMs suffice. Based on this fact, we design a framework for Cost-Effective Language Model Choice (CELMOC). Given a set of inputs and a set of candidate LMs, CELMOC judiciously assigns each input to an LM predicted to do well on the input according to a so-called meta-model, aiming to achieve high overall performance at low cost. The cost-performance trade-off can be flexibly tuned by the user. Options include, among others, maximizing total expected performance (or the number of processed inputs) while staying within a given cost budget, or minimizing total cost while processing all inputs. We evaluate CELMOC on 14 datasets covering five natural language tasks, using four candidate LMs of vastly different size and cost. With CELMOC, we match the performance of the largest available LM while achieving a cost reduction of 63%. Via our publicly available library, researchers as well as practitioners can thus save large amounts of money without sacrificing performance.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recent studies have shown that the multi-encoder models are agnostic to the choice of context, and the context encoder generates noise which helps improve the models in terms of BLEU score. In this paper, we further explore this idea by evaluating with context-aware pronoun translation test set by training multi-encoder models trained on three different context settings viz, previous two sentences, random two sentences, and a mix of both as context. Specifically, we evaluate the models on the ContraPro test set to study how different contexts affect pronoun translation accuracy. The results show that the model can perform well on the ContraPro test set even when the context is random. We also analyze the source representations to study whether the context encoder generates noise. Our analysis shows that the context encoder provides sufficient information to learn discourse-level information. Additionally, we observe that mixing the selected context (the previous two sentences in this case) and the random context is generally better than the other settings.

**ABSTRACT**  
With the emergence of increasingly powerful large language models, there is a burgeoning interest in leveraging these models for casual conversation and role-play applications. However, existing conversational and role-playing datasets often fail to capture the diverse and nuanced interactions typically exhibited by real-world role-play participants. To address this limitation and contribute to the rapidly growing field, we introduce a partially-synthetic dataset named PIPPA (Personal Interaction Pairs between People and AI). PIPPA is a result of a community-driven crowdsourcing effort involving a group of role-play enthusiasts. The dataset comprises over 1 million utterances that are distributed across 26,000 conversation sessions and provides a rich resource for researchers and AI developers to explore and refine conversational AI systems in the context of role-play scenarios.

**ABSTRACT**  
Contrary to the stunning feats observed in birds of prey, aerial manipulation and grasping with flying robots still lack versatility and agility. Conventional approaches using rigid manipulators require precise positioning and are subject to large reaction forces at grasp, which limit performance at high speeds. The few reported examples of aggressive aerial grasping rely on motion capture systems, or fail to generalize across environments and grasp targets. We describe the first example of a soft aerial manipulator equipped with a fully onboard perception pipeline, capable of robustly localizing and grasping visually and morphologically varied objects. The proposed system features a novel passively closing tendon-actuated soft gripper that enables fast closure at grasp, while compensating for position errors, complying to the target-object morphology, and dampening reaction forces. The system includes an onboard perception pipeline that combines a neural-network-based semantic keypoint detector with a state-of-the-art robust 3D object pose estimator, whose estimate is further refined using a fixed-lag smoother. The resulting pose estimate is passed to a minimum-snap trajectory planner, tracked by an adaptive controller that fully compensates for the added mass of the grasped object. Finally, a finite-element-based controller determines optimal gripper configurations for grasping. Rigorous experiments confirm that our approach enables dynamic, aggressive, and versatile grasping. We demonstrate fully onboard vision-based grasps of a variety of objects, in both indoor and outdoor environments, and up to speeds of 2.0 m/s -- the fastest vision-based grasp reported in the literature. Finally, we take a major step in expanding the utility of our platform beyond stationary targets, by demonstrating motion-capture-based grasps of targets moving up to 0.3 m/s, with relative speeds up to 1.5 m/s.

**ABSTRACT**  
The rapid accessibility of portable and affordable retinal imaging devices has made early differential diagnosis easier. For example, color funduscopy imaging is readily available in remote villages, which can help to identify diseases like age-related macular degeneration (AMD), glaucoma, or pathological myopia (PM). On the other hand, astronauts at the International Space Station utilize this camera for identifying spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS). However, due to the unavailability of experts in these locations, the data has to be transferred to an urban healthcare facility (AMD and glaucoma) or a terrestrial station (e.g, SANS) for more precise disease identification. Moreover, due to low bandwidth limits, the imaging data has to be compressed for transfer between these two places. Different super-resolution algorithms have been proposed throughout the years to address this. Furthermore, with the advent of deep learning, the field has advanced so much that x2 and x4 compressed images can be decompressed to their original form without losing spatial information. In this paper, we introduce a novel model called Swin-FSR that utilizes Swin Transformer with spatial and depth-wise attention for fundus image super-resolution. Our architecture achieves Peak signal-to-noise-ratio (PSNR) of 47.89, 49.00 and 45.32 on three public datasets, namely iChallenge-AMD, iChallenge-PM, and G1020. Additionally, we tested the model's effectiveness on a privately held dataset for SANS provided by NASA and achieved comparable results against previous architectures.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this paper, we explore potential uses of generative AI models, such as ChatGPT, for investment portfolio selection. Trusting investment advice from Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT) models is a challenge due to model "hallucinations", necessitating careful verification and validation of the output. Therefore, we take an alternative approach. We use ChatGPT to obtain a universe of stocks from S&P500 market index that are potentially attractive for investing. Subsequently, we compared various portfolio optimization strategies that utilized this AI-generated trading universe, evaluating those against quantitative portfolio optimization models as well as comparing to some of the popular investment funds. Our findings indicate that ChatGPT is effective in stock selection but may not perform as well in assigning optimal weights to stocks within the portfolio. But when stocks selection by ChatGPT is combined with established portfolio optimization models, we achieve even better results. By blending strengths of AI-generated stock selection with advanced quantitative optimization techniques, we observed the potential for more robust and favorable investment outcomes, suggesting a hybrid approach for more effective and reliable investment decision-making in the future.

**ABSTRACT**  
Resilience engineering studies the ability of a system to survive and recover from disruptive events, which finds applications in several domains. Most studies emphasize resilience metrics to quantify system performance, whereas recent studies propose statistical modeling approaches to project system recovery time after degradation. Moreover, past studies are either performed on data after recovering or limited to idealized trends. Therefore, this paper proposes three alternative neural network (NN) approaches including (i) Artificial Neural Networks, (ii) Recurrent Neural Networks, and (iii) Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) to model and predict system performance, including negative and positive factors driving resilience to quantify the impact of disruptive events and restorative activities. Goodness-of-fit measures are computed to evaluate the models and compared with a classical statistical model, including mean squared error and adjusted R squared. Our results indicate that NN models outperformed the traditional model on all goodness-of-fit measures. More specifically, LSTMs achieved an over 60\% higher adjusted R squared, and decreased predictive error by 34-fold compared to the traditional method. These results suggest that NN models to predict resilience are both feasible and accurate and may find practical use in many important domains.

**ABSTRACT**  
The concept of augmented reality (AR) assistants has captured the human imagination for decades, becoming a staple of modern science fiction. To pursue this goal, it is necessary to develop artificial intelligence (AI)-based methods that simultaneously perceive the 3D environment, reason about physical tasks, and model the performer, all in real-time. Within this framework, a wide variety of sensors are needed to generate data across different modalities, such as audio, video, depth, speech, and time-of-flight. The required sensors are typically part of the AR headset, providing performer sensing and interaction through visual, audio, and haptic feedback. AI assistants not only record the performer as they perform activities, but also require machine learning (ML) models to understand and assist the performer as they interact with the physical world. Therefore, developing such assistants is a challenging task. We propose ARGUS, a visual analytics system to support the development of intelligent AR assistants. Our system was designed as part of a multi year-long collaboration between visualization researchers and ML and AR experts. This co-design process has led to advances in the visualization of ML in AR. Our system allows for online visualization of object, action, and step detection as well as offline analysis of previously recorded AR sessions. It visualizes not only the multimodal sensor data streams but also the output of the ML models. This allows developers to gain insights into the performer activities as well as the ML models, helping them troubleshoot, improve, and fine tune the components of the AR assistant.

**ABSTRACT**  
Non-volatile memory (NVM) crossbars have been identified as a promising technology, for accelerating important machine learning operations, with matrix-vector multiplication being a key example. Binary neural networks (BNNs) are especially well-suited for use with NVM crossbars due to their use of a low-bitwidth representation for both activations and weights. However, the aggressive quantization of BNNs can result in suboptimal accuracy, and the analog effects of NVM crossbars can further degrade the accuracy during inference.   This paper presents a comprehensive study that benchmarks BNNs trained and validated on ImageNet and deployed on NeuroSim, a simulator for NVM-crossbar-based PIM architecture. Our study analyzes the impact of various parameters, such as input precision and ADC resolution, on both the accuracy of the inference and the hardware performance metrics. We have found that an ADC resolution of 8-bit with an input precision of 4-bit achieves near-optimal accuracy compared to the original BNNs. In addition, we have identified bottleneck components in the PIM architecture that affect area, latency, and energy consumption, and we demonstrate the impact that different BNN layers have on hardware performance.

**ABSTRACT**  
Conversational recommender systems (CRSs) aim to recommend high-quality items to users through a dialogue interface. It usually contains multiple sub-tasks, such as user preference elicitation, recommendation, explanation, and item information search. To develop effective CRSs, there are some challenges: 1) how to properly manage sub-tasks; 2) how to effectively solve different sub-tasks; and 3) how to correctly generate responses that interact with users. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited an unprecedented ability to reason and generate, presenting a new opportunity to develop more powerful CRSs. In this work, we propose a new LLM-based CRS, referred to as LLMCRS, to address the above challenges. For sub-task management, we leverage the reasoning ability of LLM to effectively manage sub-task. For sub-task solving, we collaborate LLM with expert models of different sub-tasks to achieve the enhanced performance. For response generation, we utilize the generation ability of LLM as a language interface to better interact with users. Specifically, LLMCRS divides the workflow into four stages: sub-task detection, model matching, sub-task execution, and response generation. LLMCRS also designs schema-based instruction, demonstration-based instruction, dynamic sub-task and model matching, and summary-based generation to instruct LLM to generate desired results in the workflow. Finally, to adapt LLM to conversational recommendations, we also propose to fine-tune LLM with reinforcement learning from CRSs performance feedback, referred to as RLPF. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that LLMCRS with RLPF outperforms the existing methods.

**ABSTRACT**  
The Forum for Information Retrieval (FIRE) started a shared task this year for classification of comments of different code segments. This is binary text classification task where the objective is to identify whether comments given for certain code segments are relevant or not. The BioNLP-IISERB group at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Bhopal (IISERB) participated in this task and submitted five runs for five different models. The paper presents the overview of the models and other significant findings on the training corpus. The methods involve different feature engineering schemes and text classification techniques. The performance of the classical bag of words model and transformer-based models were explored to identify significant features from the given training corpus. We have explored different classifiers viz., random forest, support vector machine and logistic regression using the bag of words model. Furthermore, the pre-trained transformer based models like BERT, RoBERT and ALBERT were also used by fine-tuning them on the given training corpus. The performance of different such models over the training corpus were reported and the best five models were implemented on the given test corpus. The empirical results show that the bag of words model outperforms the transformer based models, however, the performance of our runs are not reasonably well in both training and test corpus. This paper also addresses the limitations of the models and scope for further improvement.

**ABSTRACT**  
Integrated Circuits (ICs) are the target of diverse attacks during their lifetime. Fabrication-time attacks, such as the insertion of Hardware Trojans, can give an adversary access to privileged data and/or the means to corrupt the IC's internal computation. Post-fabrication attacks, where the end-user takes a malicious role, also attempt to obtain privileged information through means such as fault injection and probing. Taking these threats into account and at the same time, this paper proposes a methodology for Security-Aware Layout Synthesis (SALSy), such that ICs can be designed with security in mind in the same manner as power-performance-area (PPA) metrics are considered today, a concept known as security closure. Furthermore, the trade-offs between PPA and security are considered and a chip is fabricated in a 65nm CMOS commercial technology for validation purposes - a feature not seen in previous research on security closure. Measurements on the fabricated ICs indicate that SALSy promotes a modest increase in power in order to achieve significantly improved security metrics.

We aim to provide a thorough understanding of the concept of physical adversarial attacks, analyzing their key characteristics and distinguishing features. Furthermore, we explore the specific requirements and challenges associated with executing attacks in the physical world. Our article delves into various physical adversarial attack methods, categorized according to their target tasks in different applications, including classification, detection, face recognition, semantic segmentation and depth estimation. We assess the performance of these attack methods in terms of their effectiveness, stealthiness, and robustness. We examine how each technique strives to ensure the successful manipulation of DNNs while mitigating the risk of detection and withstanding real-world distortions. Lastly, we discuss the current challenges and outline potential future research directions in the field of physical adversarial attacks. We highlight the need for enhanced defense mechanisms, the exploration of novel attack strategies, the evaluation of attacks in different application domains, and the establishment of standardized benchmarks and evaluation criteria for physical adversarial attacks. Through this comprehensive survey, we aim to provide a valuable resource for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers to gain a holistic understanding of physical adversarial attacks in computer vision and facilitate the development of robust and secure DNN-based systems.

**ABSTRACT**  
The emergence of quantum computing raises the question of how to identify (security-relevant) programming errors during development. However, current static code analysis tools fail to model information specific to quantum computing. In this paper, we identify this information and propose to extend classical code analysis tools accordingly. Among such tools, we identify the Code Property Graph to be very well suited for this task as it can be easily extended with quantum computing specific information. For our proof of concept, we implemented a tool which includes information from the quantum world in the graph and demonstrate its ability to analyze source code written in Qiskit and OpenQASM. Our tool brings together the information from the classical and quantum world, enabling analysis across both domains. By combining all relevant information into a single detailed analysis, this powerful tool can facilitate tackling future quantum source code analysis challenges.

**ABSTRACT**  
Tweakable Enciphering Scheme (TES) is a length preserving scheme which provides confidentiality and admissible integrity. XCB (Extended Code Book) is a TES which was introduced in 2004. In 2007, it was modified and security bound was provided. Later, these two versions were referred to as XCBv1 and XCBv2 respectively. XCBv2 was proposed as the IEEE-std 1619.2 2010 for encryption of sector oriented storage media. In 2013, first time Security bound of XCBv1 was given and XCBv2's security bound was enhanced. A constant of $2^{22}$ appears in the security bounds of the XCBv1 and XCBv2.   We showed that this constant of $2^{22}$ can be reduced to $2^{5}$. Further, we modified the XCB (MXCB) scheme such that it gives better security bound compared to the present XCB scheme. We also analyzed some weak keys attack on XCB and a type of TES known as HCTR (proposed in 2005). We performed distinguishing attack and the hash key recovery attack on HCTR. Next, we analyzed the dependency of the two different keys in HCTR.

**ABSTRACT**  
The expansion of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) paradigm is inevitable, but vulnerabilities of IoT devices to malware incidents have become an increasing concern. Recent research has shown that the integration of Reinforcement Learning with Moving Target Defense (MTD) mechanisms can enhance cybersecurity in IoT devices. Nevertheless, the numerous new malware attacks and the time that agents take to learn and select effective MTD techniques make this approach impractical for real-world IoT scenarios. To tackle this issue, this work presents CyberForce, a framework that employs Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL) to collectively and privately determine suitable MTD techniques for mitigating diverse zero-day attacks. CyberForce integrates device fingerprinting and anomaly detection to reward or penalize MTD mechanisms chosen by an FRL-based agent. The framework has been evaluated in a federation consisting of ten devices of a real IoT platform. A pool of experiments with six malware samples affecting the devices has demonstrated that CyberForce can precisely learn optimum MTD mitigation strategies. When all clients are affected by all attacks, the FRL agent exhibits high accuracy and reduced training time when compared to a centralized RL agent. In cases where different clients experience distinct attacks, the CyberForce clients gain benefits through the transfer of knowledge from other clients and similar attack behavior. Additionally, CyberForce showcases notable robustness against data poisoning attacks.

**ABSTRACT**  
This article introduces a framework that is meant to assist in mitigating societal risks that software can pose. Concretely, this encompasses facets of software doping as well as unfairness and discrimination in high-risk decision-making systems. The term software doping refers to software that contains surreptitiously added functionality that is against the interest of the user. A prominent example of software doping are the tampered emission cleaning systems that were found in millions of cars around the world when the diesel emissions scandal surfaced. The first part of this article combines the formal foundations of software doping analysis with established probabilistic falsification techniques to arrive at a black-box analysis technique for identifying undesired effects of software. We apply this technique to emission cleaning systems in diesel cars but also to high-risk systems that evaluate humans in a possibly unfair or discriminating way. We demonstrate how our approach can assist humans-in-the-loop to make better informed and more responsible decisions. This is to promote effective human oversight, which will be a central requirement enforced by the European Union's upcoming AI Act. We complement our technical contribution with a juridically, philosophically, and psychologically informed perspective on the potential problems caused by such systems.

**ABSTRACT**  
As the adoption of smart devices continues to permeate all aspects of our lives, concerns surrounding user privacy have become more pertinent than ever before. While privacy policies define the data management practices of their manufacturers, previous work has shown that they are rarely read and understood by users. Hence, automatic analysis of privacy policies has been shown to help provide users with appropriate insights. Previous research has extensively analyzed privacy policies of websites, e-commerce, and mobile applications, but privacy policies of smart devices, present some differences and specific challenges such as the difficulty to find and collect them. We present PrivacyLens, a novel framework for discovering and collecting past, present, and future smart device privacy policies and harnessing NLP and ML algorithms to analyze them. PrivacyLens is currently deployed, collecting, analyzing, and publishing insights about privacy policies to assist different stakeholders of smart devices, such as users, policy authors, and regulators. We show several examples of analytical tasks enabled by PrivacyLens, including comparisons of devices per type and manufacturing country, categorization of privacy policies, and impact of data regulations on data practices. At the time of submitting this paper, PrivacyLens had collected and analyzed more than 1,200 privacy policies for 7,300 smart device

**ABSTRACT**  
Inter-city highway transportation is significant for citizens' modern urban life and generates heterogeneous sensory data with spatio-temporal characteristics. As a routine analysis in transportation domain, daily traffic volume estimation faces challenges for highway toll stations including lacking of exploration of correlative spatio-temporal features from a long-term perspective and effective means to deal with data imbalance which always deteriorates the predictive performance. In this paper, a deep spatio-temporal learning method is proposed to predict daily traffic volume in three phases. In feature pre-processing phase, data is normalized elaborately according to latent long-tail distribution. In spatio-temporal learning phase, a hybrid model is employed combining fully convolution network (FCN) and long short-term memory (LSTM), which considers time, space, meteorology, and calendar from heterogeneous data. In decision phase, traffic volumes on a coming day at network-wide toll stations would be achieved effectively, which is especially calibrated for vital few highway stations. Using real-world data from one Chinese provincial highway, extensive experiments show our method has distinct improvement for predictive accuracy than various traditional models, reaching 5.269 and 0.997 in MPAE and R-squre metrics, respectively.

**ABSTRACT**  
Soft sensors have been extensively used to monitor key variables using easy-to-measure variables and mathematical models. Partial differential equations (PDEs) are model candidates for soft sensors in industrial processes with spatiotemporal dependence. However, gaps often exist between idealized PDEs and practical situations. Discovering proper structures of PDEs, including the differential operators and source terms, can remedy the gaps. To this end, a coupled physics-informed neural network with Akaike's criterion information (CPINN-AIC) is proposed for PDE discovery of soft sensors. First, CPINN is adopted for obtaining solutions and source terms satisfying PDEs. Then, we propose a data-physics-hybrid loss function for training CPINN, in which undetermined combinations of differential operators are involved. Consequently, AIC is used to discover the proper combination of differential operators. Finally, the artificial and practical datasets are used to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of CPINN-AIC for soft sensors. The proposed CPINN-AIC is a data-driven method to discover proper PDE structures and neural network-based solutions for soft sensors.

**ABSTRACT**  
Training state-of-the-art neural networks requires a high cost in terms of compute and time. Model scale is recognized to be a critical factor to achieve and improve the state-of-the-art. Increasing the scale of a neural network normally requires restarting from scratch by randomly initializing all the parameters of the model, as this implies a change of architecture's parameters that does not allow for a straightforward transfer of knowledge from smaller size models. In this work, we propose six composable transformations to incrementally increase the size of transformer-based neural networks while preserving functionality, allowing to expand the capacity of the model as needed. We provide proof of exact function preservation under minimal initialization constraints for each transformation. The proposed methods may enable efficient training pipelines for larger and more powerful models by progressively expanding the architecture throughout training.

**ABSTRACT**  
Federated learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm that enables multiple clients to learn a powerful global model by aggregating local training. However, the performance of the global model is often hampered by non-i.i.d. distribution among the clients, requiring extensive efforts to mitigate inter-client data heterogeneity. Going beyond inter-client data heterogeneity, we note that intra-client heterogeneity can also be observed on complex real-world data and seriously deteriorate FL performance. In this paper, we present a novel FL algorithm, i.e., FedIns, to handle intra-client data heterogeneity by enabling instance-adaptive inference in the FL framework. Instead of huge instance-adaptive models, we resort to a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method, i.e., scale and shift deep features (SSF), upon a pre-trained model. Specifically, we first train an SSF pool for each client, and aggregate these SSF pools on the server side, thus still maintaining a low communication cost. To enable instance-adaptive inference, for a given instance, we dynamically find the best-matched SSF subsets from the pool and aggregate them to generate an adaptive SSF specified for the instance, thereby reducing the intra-client as well as the inter-client heterogeneity. Extensive experiments show that our FedIns outperforms state-of-the-art FL algorithms, e.g., a 6.64\% improvement against the top-performing method with less than 15\% communication cost on Tiny-ImageNet. Our code and models will be publicly released.

**ABSTRACT**  
AI for science (AI4S) is an emerging research field that aims to enhance the accuracy and speed of scientific computing tasks using machine learning methods. Traditional AI benchmarking methods struggle to adapt to the unique challenges posed by AI4S because they assume data in training, testing, and future real-world queries are independent and identically distributed, while AI4S workloads anticipate out-of-distribution problem instances. This paper investigates the need for a novel approach to effectively benchmark AI for science, using the machine learning force field (MLFF) as a case study. MLFF is a method to accelerate molecular dynamics (MD) simulation with low computational cost and high accuracy. We identify various missed opportunities in scientifically meaningful benchmarking and propose solutions to evaluate MLFF models, specifically in the aspects of sample efficiency, time domain sensitivity, and cross-dataset generalization capabilities. By setting up the problem instantiation similar to the actual scientific applications, more meaningful performance metrics from the benchmark can be achieved. This suite of metrics has demonstrated a better ability to assess a model's performance in real-world scientific applications, in contrast to traditional AI benchmarking methodologies. This work is a component of the SAIBench project, an AI4S benchmarking suite. The project homepage is https://www.computercouncil.org/SAIBench.

**ABSTRACT**  
Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) differs from the common perception tasks as it requires deeper reasoning over the video sequence, even by human experts. Despite the recent advances in VSR, current approaches rely on labeled data to fully train or finetune their models predicting the target speech. This hinders their ability to generalize well beyond the training set and leads to performance degeneration under out-of-distribution challenging scenarios. Unlike previous works that involve auxiliary losses or complex training procedures and architectures, we propose a simple approach, named Lip2Vec that is based on learning a prior model. Given a robust visual speech encoder, this network maps the encoded latent representations of the lip sequence to their corresponding latents from the audio pair, which are sufficiently invariant for effective text decoding. The generated audio representation is then decoded to text using an off-the-shelf Audio Speech Recognition (ASR) model. The proposed model compares favorably with fully-supervised learning methods on the LRS3 dataset achieving 26 WER. Unlike SoTA approaches, our model keeps a reasonable performance on the VoxCeleb test set. We believe that reprogramming the VSR as an ASR task narrows the performance gap between the two and paves the way for more flexible formulations of lip reading.

**ABSTRACT**  
Machine Learning models are capable of generating complex music across a range of genres from folk to classical music. However, current generative music AI models are typically difficult to understand and control in meaningful ways. Whilst research has started to explore how explainable AI (XAI) generative models might be created for music, no generative XAI models have been studied in music making practice. This paper introduces an autoethnographic study of the use of the MeasureVAE generative music XAI model with interpretable latent dimensions trained on Irish folk music. Findings suggest that the exploratory nature of the music-making workflow foregrounds musical features of the training dataset rather than features of the generative model itself. The appropriation of an XAI model within an iterative workflow highlights the potential of XAI models to form part of a richer and more complex workflow than they were initially designed for.

**ABSTRACT**  
The objective of the sound source localization task is to enable machines to detect the location of sound-making objects within a visual scene. While the audio modality provides spatial cues to locate the sound source, existing approaches only use audio as an auxiliary role to compare spatial regions of the visual modality. Humans, on the other hand, utilize both audio and visual modalities as spatial cues to locate sound sources. In this paper, we propose an audio-visual spatial integration network that integrates spatial cues from both modalities to mimic human behavior when detecting sound-making objects. Additionally, we introduce a recursive attention network to mimic human behavior of iterative focusing on objects, resulting in more accurate attention regions. To effectively encode spatial information from both modalities, we propose audio-visual pair matching loss and spatial region alignment loss. By utilizing the spatial cues of audio-visual modalities and recursively focusing objects, our method can perform more robust sound source localization. Comprehensive experimental results on the Flickr SoundNet and VGG-Sound Source datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over existing approaches.

**ABSTRACT**  
Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a transformative force, revolutionizing numerous fields well beyond the conventional domain of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and garnering unprecedented attention. As LLM technology continues to progress, the telecom industry is facing the prospect of its potential impact on its landscape. To elucidate these implications, we delve into the inner workings of LLMs, providing insights into their current capabilities and limitations. We also examine the use cases that can be readily implemented in the telecom industry, streamlining numerous tasks that currently hinder operational efficiency and demand significant manpower and engineering expertise. Furthermore, we uncover essential research directions that deal with the distinctive challenges of utilizing the LLMs within the telecom domain. Addressing these challenges represents a significant stride towards fully harnessing the potential of LLMs and unlocking their capabilities to the fullest extent within the telecom domain.

**ABSTRACT**  
Foundation models are increasingly attracting interest worldwide for their distinguished capabilities and potential to perform a wide variety of tasks. Nevertheless, people are concerned about whether foundation model based AI systems are properly governed to ensure trustworthiness of foundation model based AI systems and to prevent misuse that could harm humans, society and the environment. In this paper, we identify eight governance challenges in the entire lifecycle of foundation model based AI systems regarding the three fundamental dimensions of governance: decision rights, incentives, and accountability. Furthermore, we explore the potential of blockchain as a solution to address the challenges by providing a distributed ledger to facilitate decentralised governance. We present an architecture that demonstrates how blockchain can be leveraged to realise governance in foundation model based AI systems.

**ABSTRACT**  
Representing nodes in a network as dense vectors node embeddings is important for understanding a given network and solving many downstream tasks. In particular, for weighted homophilous graphs where similar nodes are connected with larger edge weights, we desire node embeddings where node pairs with strong weights have closer embeddings. Although random walk based node embedding methods like node2vec and node2vec+ do work for weighted networks via including edge weights in the walk transition probabilities, our experiments show that the embedding result does not adequately reflect edge weights. In this paper, we propose ARGEW (Augmentation of Random walks by Graph Edge Weights), a novel augmentation method for random walks that expands the corpus in such a way that nodes with larger edge weights end up with closer embeddings. ARGEW can work with any random walk based node embedding method, because it is independent of the random sampling strategy itself and works on top of the already-performed walks. With several real-world networks, we demonstrate that with ARGEW, compared to not using it, the desired pattern that node pairs with larger edge weights have closer embeddings is much clearer. We also examine ARGEW's performance in node classification: node2vec with ARGEW outperforms pure node2vec and is not sensitive to hyperparameters (i.e. consistently good). In fact, it achieves similarly good results as supervised GCN, even without any node feature or label information during training. Finally, we explain why ARGEW works consistently well by exploring the coappearance distributions using a synthetic graph with clear structural roles.

**ABSTRACT**  
Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) introduces a lightweight, function-based cloud execution model that finds its relevance in applications like IoT-edge data processing and anomaly detection. While CSP offer a near-infinite function elasticity, these applications often experience fluctuating workloads and stricter performance constraints. A typical CSP strategy is to empirically determine and adjust desired function instances, "autoscaling", based on monitoring-based thresholds such as CPU or memory, to cope with demand and performance. However, threshold configuration either requires expert knowledge, historical data or a complete view of environment, making autoscaling a performance bottleneck lacking an adaptable solution.RL algorithms are proven to be beneficial in analysing complex cloud environments and result in an adaptable policy that maximizes the expected objectives. Most realistic cloud environments usually involve operational interference and have limited visibility, making them partially observable. A general solution to tackle observability in highly dynamic settings is to integrate Recurrent units with model-free RL algorithms and model a decision process as a POMDP. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate a model-free Recurrent RL agent for function autoscaling and compare it against the model-free Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) algorithm. We explore the integration of a LSTM network with the state-of-the-art PPO algorithm to find that under our experimental and evaluation settings, recurrent policies were able to capture the environment parameters and show promising results for function autoscaling. We further compare a PPO-based autoscaling agent with commercially used threshold-based function autoscaling and posit that a LSTM-based autoscaling agent is able to improve throughput by 18%, function execution by 13% and account for 8.4% more function instances.

**ABSTRACT**  
We hypothesize that large language models (LLMs) based on the transformer architecture can enable automated detection of clinical phenotype terms, including terms not documented in the HPO. In this study, we developed two types of models: PhenoBCBERT, a BERT-based model, utilizing Bio+Clinical BERT as its pre-trained model, and PhenoGPT, a GPT-based model that can be initialized from diverse GPT models, including open-source versions such as GPT-J, Falcon, and LLaMA, as well as closed-source versions such as GPT-3 and GPT-3.5. We compared our methods with PhenoTagger, a recently developed HPO recognition tool that combines rule-based and deep learning methods. We found that our methods can extract more phenotype concepts, including novel ones not characterized by HPO. We also performed case studies on biomedical literature to illustrate how new phenotype information can be recognized and extracted. We compared current BERT-based versus GPT-based models for phenotype tagging, in multiple aspects including model architecture, memory usage, speed, accuracy, and privacy protection. We also discussed the addition of a negation step and an HPO normalization layer to the transformer models for improved HPO term tagging. In conclusion, PhenoBCBERT and PhenoGPT enable the automated discovery of phenotype terms from clinical notes and biomedical literature, facilitating automated downstream tasks to derive new biological insights on human diseases.
