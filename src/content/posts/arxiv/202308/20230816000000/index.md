**ABSTRACT**  
Online questionnaires that use crowd-sourcing platforms to recruit participants have become commonplace, due to their ease of use and low costs. Artificial Intelligence (AI) based Large Language Models (LLM) have made it easy for bad actors to automatically fill in online forms, including generating meaningful text for open-ended tasks. These technological advances threaten the data quality for studies that use online questionnaires. This study tested if text generated by an AI for the purpose of an online study can be detected by both humans and automatic AI detection systems. While humans were able to correctly identify authorship of text above chance level (76 percent accuracy), their performance was still below what would be required to ensure satisfactory data quality. Researchers currently have to rely on the disinterest of bad actors to successfully use open-ended responses as a useful tool for ensuring data quality. Automatic AI detection systems are currently completely unusable. If AIs become too prevalent in submitting responses then the costs associated with detecting fraudulent submissions will outweigh the benefits of online questionnaires. Individual attention checks will no longer be a sufficient tool to ensure good data quality. This problem can only be systematically addressed by crowd-sourcing platforms. They cannot rely on automatic AI detection systems and it is unclear how they can ensure data quality for their paying clients.

**ABSTRACT**  
A key challenge in professional fact-checking is its limited scalability in relation to the magnitude of false information. While many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools have been proposed to enhance fact-checking efficiency and scalability, both academic research and fact-checking organizations report limited adoption of such tooling due to insufficient alignment with fact-checker practices, values, and needs. To address this gap, we investigate a co-design method, Matchmaking for AI, which facilitates fact-checkers, designers, and NLP researchers to collaboratively discover what fact-checker needs should be addressed by technology and how. Our co-design sessions with 22 professional fact-checkers yielded a set of 11 novel design ideas. They assist in information searching, processing, and writing tasks for efficient and personalized fact-checking; help fact-checkers proactively prepare for future misinformation; monitor their potential biases; and support internal organization collaboration. Our work offers implications for human-centered fact-checking research and practice and AI co-design research.

**ABSTRACT**  
VLN-CE is a recently released embodied task, where AI agents need to navigate a freely traversable environment to reach a distant target location, given language instructions. It poses great challenges due to the huge space of possible strategies. Driven by the belief that the ability to anticipate the consequences of future actions is crucial for the emergence of intelligent and interpretable planning behavior, we propose DREAMWALKER -- a world model based VLN-CE agent. The world model is built to summarize the visual, topological, and dynamic properties of the complicated continuous environment into a discrete, structured, and compact representation. DREAMWALKER can simulate and evaluate possible plans entirely in such internal abstract world, before executing costly actions. As opposed to existing model-free VLN-CE agents simply making greedy decisions in the real world, which easily results in shortsighted behaviors, DREAMWALKER is able to make strategic planning through large amounts of ``mental experiments.'' Moreover, the imagined future scenarios reflect our agent's intention, making its decision-making process more transparent. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on VLN-CE dataset confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach and outline fruitful directions for future work.

**ABSTRACT**  
Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has witnessed significant advances in the field of object recognition, with saliency maps being used to highlight image features relevant to the predictions of learned models. Although these advances have made AI-based technology more interpretable to humans, several issues have come to light. Some approaches present explanations irrelevant to predictions, and cannot guarantee the validity of XAI (axioms). In this study, we propose the Baseline Shapley-based Explainable Detector (BSED), which extends the Shapley value to object detection, thereby enhancing the validity of interpretation. The Shapley value can attribute the prediction of a learned model to a baseline feature while satisfying the explainability axioms. The processing cost for the BSED is within the reasonable range, while the original Shapley value is prohibitively computationally expensive. Furthermore, BSED is a generalizable method that can be applied to various detectors in a model-agnostic manner, and interpret various detection targets without fine-grained parameter tuning. These strengths can enable the practical applicability of XAI. We present quantitative and qualitative comparisons with existing methods to demonstrate the superior performance of our method in terms of explanation validity. Moreover, we present some applications, such as correcting detection based on explanations from our method.

**ABSTRACT**  
With a strong understanding of the target domain from natural language, we produce promising results in translating across large domain gaps and bringing skeletons back to life. In this work, we use text-guided latent diffusion models for zero-shot image-to-image translation (I2I) across large domain gaps (longI2I), where large amounts of new visual features and new geometry need to be generated to enter the target domain. Being able to perform translations across large domain gaps has a wide variety of real-world applications in criminology, astrology, environmental conservation, and paleontology. In this work, we introduce a new task Skull2Animal for translating between skulls and living animals. On this task, we find that unguided Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are not capable of translating across large domain gaps. Instead of these traditional I2I methods, we explore the use of guided diffusion and image editing models and provide a new benchmark model, Revive-2I, capable of performing zero-shot I2I via text-prompting latent diffusion models. We find that guidance is necessary for longI2I because, to bridge the large domain gap, prior knowledge about the target domain is needed. In addition, we find that prompting provides the best and most scalable information about the target domain as classifier-guided diffusion models require retraining for specific use cases and lack stronger constraints on the target domain because of the wide variety of images they are trained on.

**ABSTRACT**  
The synthesis of human motion has traditionally been addressed through task-dependent models that focus on specific challenges, such as predicting future motions or filling in intermediate poses conditioned on known key-poses. In this paper, we present a novel task-independent model called UNIMASK-M, which can effectively address these challenges using a unified architecture. Our model obtains comparable or better performance than the state-of-the-art in each field. Inspired by Vision Transformers (ViTs), our UNIMASK-M model decomposes a human pose into body parts to leverage the spatio-temporal relationships existing in human motion. Moreover, we reformulate various pose-conditioned motion synthesis tasks as a reconstruction problem with different masking patterns given as input. By explicitly informing our model about the masked joints, our UNIMASK-M becomes more robust to occlusions. Experimental results show that our model successfully forecasts human motion on the Human3.6M dataset. Moreover, it achieves state-of-the-art results in motion inbetweening on the LaFAN1 dataset, particularly in long transition periods.

**ABSTRACT**  
The works in literature classifying natural and computer generated images are mostly designed as binary tasks either considering natural images versus computer graphics images only or natural images versus GAN generated images only, but not natural images versus both classes of the generated images. Also, even though this forensic classification task of distinguishing natural and computer generated images gets the support of the new convolutional neural networks and transformer based architectures that can give remarkable classification accuracies, they are seen to fail over the images that have undergone some post-processing operations usually performed to deceive the forensic algorithms, such as JPEG compression, gaussian noise, etc. This work proposes a robust approach towards distinguishing natural and computer generated images including both, computer graphics and GAN generated images using a fusion of two vision transformers where each of the transformer networks operates in different color spaces, one in RGB and the other in YCbCr color space. The proposed approach achieves high performance gain when compared to a set of baselines, and also achieves higher robustness and generalizability than the baselines. The features of the proposed model when visualized are seen to obtain higher separability for the classes than the input image features and the baseline features. This work also studies the attention map visualizations of the networks of the fused model and observes that the proposed methodology can capture more image information relevant to the forensic task of classifying natural and generated images.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this paper, we present a new multi-branch neural network that simultaneously performs soft biometric (SB) prediction as an auxiliary modality and face recognition (FR) as the main task. Our proposed network named AAFace utilizes SB attributes to enhance the discriminative ability of FR representation. To achieve this goal, we propose an attribute-aware attentional integration (AAI) module to perform weighted integration of FR with SB feature maps. Our proposed AAI module is not only fully context-aware but also capable of learning complex relationships between input features by means of the sequential multi-scale channel and spatial sub-modules. Experimental results verify the superiority of our proposed network compared with the state-of-the-art (SoTA) SB prediction and FR methods.

**ABSTRACT**  
Performance estimation under covariate shift is a crucial component of safe AI model deployment, especially for sensitive use-cases. Recently, several solutions were proposed to tackle this problem, most leveraging model predictions or softmax confidence to derive accuracy estimates. However, under dataset shifts, confidence scores may become ill-calibrated if samples are too far from the training distribution. In this work, we show that taking into account distances of test samples to their expected training distribution can significantly improve performance estimation under covariate shift. Precisely, we introduce a "distance-check" to flag samples that lie too far from the expected distribution, to avoid relying on their untrustworthy model outputs in the accuracy estimation step. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on 13 image classification tasks, across a wide-range of natural and synthetic distribution shifts and hundreds of models, with a median relative MAE improvement of 27% over the best baseline across all tasks, and SOTA performance on 10 out of 13 tasks. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/melanibe/distance_matters_performance_estimation.

**ABSTRACT**  
Due to the flexible representation of arbitrary-shaped scene text and simple pipeline, bottom-up segmentation-based methods begin to be mainstream in real-time scene text detection. Despite great progress, these methods show deficiencies in robustness and still suffer from false positives and instance adhesion. Different from existing methods which integrate multiple-granularity features or multiple outputs, we resort to the perspective of representation learning in which auxiliary tasks are utilized to enable the encoder to jointly learn robust features with the main task of per-pixel classification during optimization. For semantic representation learning, we propose global-dense semantic contrast (GDSC), in which a vector is extracted for global semantic representation, then used to perform element-wise contrast with the dense grid features. To learn instance-aware representation, we propose to combine top-down modeling (TDM) with the bottom-up framework to provide implicit instance-level clues for the encoder. With the proposed GDSC and TDM, the encoder network learns stronger representation without introducing any parameters and computations during inference. Equipped with a very light decoder, the detector can achieve more robust real-time scene text detection. Experimental results on four public datasets show that the proposed method can outperform or be comparable to the state-of-the-art on both accuracy and speed. Specifically, the proposed method achieves 87.2% F-measure with 48.2 FPS on Total-Text and 89.6% F-measure with 36.9 FPS on MSRA-TD500 on a single GeForce RTX 2080 Ti GPU.

**ABSTRACT**  
Sparse neural networks are a key factor in developing resource-efficient machine learning applications. We propose the novel and powerful sparse learning method Adaptive Regularized Training (ART) to compress dense into sparse networks. Instead of the commonly used binary mask during training to reduce the number of model weights, we inherently shrink weights close to zero in an iterative manner with increasing weight regularization. Our method compresses the pre-trained model knowledge into the weights of highest magnitude. Therefore, we introduce a novel regularization loss named HyperSparse that exploits the highest weights while conserving the ability of weight exploration. Extensive experiments on CIFAR and TinyImageNet show that our method leads to notable performance gains compared to other sparsification methods, especially in extremely high sparsity regimes up to 99.8 percent model sparsity. Additional investigations provide new insights into the patterns that are encoded in weights with high magnitudes.

**ABSTRACT**  
Cultural heritage applications and advanced machine learning models are creating a fruitful synergy to provide effective and accessible ways of interacting with artworks. Smart audio-guides, personalized art-related content and gamification approaches are just a few examples of how technology can be exploited to provide additional value to artists or exhibitions. Nonetheless, from a machine learning point of view, the amount of available artistic data is often not enough to train effective models. Off-the-shelf computer vision modules can still be exploited to some extent, yet a severe domain shift is present between art images and standard natural image datasets used to train such models. As a result, this can lead to degraded performance. This paper introduces a novel approach to address the challenges of limited annotated data and domain shifts in the cultural heritage domain. By leveraging generative vision-language models, we augment art datasets by generating diverse variations of artworks conditioned on their captions. This augmentation strategy enhances dataset diversity, bridging the gap between natural images and artworks, and improving the alignment of visual cues with knowledge from general-purpose datasets. The generated variations assist in training vision and language models with a deeper understanding of artistic characteristics and that are able to generate better captions with appropriate jargon.

**ABSTRACT**  
Deep learning has achieved great success in video recognition, yet still struggles to recognize novel actions when faced with only a few examples. To tackle this challenge, few-shot action recognition methods have been proposed to transfer knowledge from a source dataset to a novel target dataset with only one or a few labeled videos. However, existing methods mainly focus on modeling the temporal relations between the query and support videos while ignoring the spatial relations. In this paper, we find that the spatial misalignment between objects also occurs in videos, notably more common than the temporal inconsistency. We are thus motivated to investigate the importance of spatial relations and propose a more accurate few-shot action recognition method that leverages both spatial and temporal information. Particularly, a novel Spatial Alignment Cross Transformer (SA-CT) which learns to re-adjust the spatial relations and incorporates the temporal information is contributed. Experiments reveal that, even without using any temporal information, the performance of SA-CT is comparable to temporal based methods on 3/4 benchmarks. To further incorporate the temporal information, we propose a simple yet effective Temporal Mixer module. The Temporal Mixer enhances the video representation and improves the performance of the full SA-CT model, achieving very competitive results. In this work, we also exploit large-scale pretrained models for few-shot action recognition, providing useful insights for this research direction.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper presents a module, Spatial Cross-scale Convolution (SCSC), which is verified to be effective in improving both CNNs and Transformers. Nowadays, CNNs and Transformers have been successful in a variety of tasks. Especially for Transformers, increasing works achieve state-of-the-art performance in the computer vision community. Therefore, researchers start to explore the mechanism of those architectures. Large receptive fields, sparse connections, weight sharing, and dynamic weight have been considered keys to designing effective base models. However, there are still some issues to be addressed: large dense kernels and self-attention are inefficient, and large receptive fields make it hard to capture local features. Inspired by the above analyses and to solve the mentioned problems, in this paper, we design a general module taking in these design keys to enhance both CNNs and Transformers. SCSC introduces an efficient spatial cross-scale encoder and spatial embed module to capture assorted features in one layer. On the face recognition task, FaceResNet with SCSC can improve 2.7% with 68% fewer FLOPs and 79% fewer parameters. On the ImageNet classification task, Swin Transformer with SCSC can achieve even better performance with 22% fewer FLOPs, and ResNet with CSCS can improve 5.3% with similar complexity. Furthermore, a traditional network (e.g., ResNet) embedded with SCSC can match Swin Transformer's performance.

**ABSTRACT**  
Modern supervised semantic segmentation methods are usually finetuned based on the supervised or self-supervised models pre-trained on ImageNet. Recent work shows that transferring the knowledge from CLIP to semantic segmentation via prompt learning can achieve promising performance. The performance boost comes from the feature enhancement with multimodal alignment, i.e., the dot product between vision and text embeddings. However, how to improve the multimodal alignment for better transfer performance in dense tasks remains underexplored. In this work, we focus on improving the quality of vision-text alignment from two aspects of prompting design and loss function, and present an instance-conditioned prompting with contrastive learning (ICPC) framework. First, compared with the static prompt designs, we reveal that dynamic prompting conditioned on image content can more efficiently utilize the text encoder for complex dense tasks. Second, we propose an align-guided contrastive loss to refine the alignment of vision and text embeddings. We further propose lightweight multi-scale alignment for better performance. Extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets (ADE20K, COCO-Stuff10k, and ADE20K-Full) demonstrate that ICPC brings consistent improvements across diverse backbones. Taking ResNet-50 as an example, ICPC outperforms the state-of-the-art counterpart by 1.71%, 1.05%, and 1.41% mIoU on the three datasets, respectively.

**ABSTRACT**  
The increasing popularity of compact and inexpensive cameras, e.g.~dash cameras, body cameras, and cameras equipped on robots, has sparked a growing interest in detecting anomalies within dynamic scenes recorded by moving cameras. However, existing reviews primarily concentrate on Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) methods assuming static cameras. The VAD literature with moving cameras remains fragmented, lacking comprehensive reviews to date. To address this gap, we endeavor to present the first comprehensive survey on Moving Camera Video Anomaly Detection (MC-VAD). We delve into the research papers related to MC-VAD, critically assessing their limitations and highlighting associated challenges. Our exploration encompasses three application domains: security, urban transportation, and marine environments, which in turn cover six specific tasks. We compile an extensive list of 25 publicly-available datasets spanning four distinct environments: underwater, water surface, ground, and aerial. We summarize the types of anomalies these datasets correspond to or contain, and present five main categories of approaches for detecting such anomalies. Lastly, we identify future research directions and discuss novel contributions that could advance the field of MC-VAD. With this survey, we aim to offer a valuable reference for researchers and practitioners striving to develop and advance state-of-the-art MC-VAD methods.

**ABSTRACT**  
Multimodal contrastive learning aims to train a general-purpose feature extractor, such as CLIP, on vast amounts of raw, unlabeled paired image-text data. This can greatly benefit various complex downstream tasks, including cross-modal image-text retrieval and image classification. Despite its promising prospect, the security issue of cross-modal pre-trained encoder has not been fully explored yet, especially when the pre-trained encoder is publicly available for commercial use.   In this work, we propose AdvCLIP, the first attack framework for generating downstream-agnostic adversarial examples based on cross-modal pre-trained encoders. AdvCLIP aims to construct a universal adversarial patch for a set of natural images that can fool all the downstream tasks inheriting the victim cross-modal pre-trained encoder. To address the challenges of heterogeneity between different modalities and unknown downstream tasks, we first build a topological graph structure to capture the relevant positions between target samples and their neighbors. Then, we design a topology-deviation based generative adversarial network to generate a universal adversarial patch. By adding the patch to images, we minimize their embeddings similarity to different modality and perturb the sample distribution in the feature space, achieving unviersal non-targeted attacks. Our results demonstrate the excellent attack performance of AdvCLIP on two types of downstream tasks across eight datasets. We also tailor three popular defenses to mitigate AdvCLIP, highlighting the need for new defense mechanisms to defend cross-modal pre-trained encoders.

**ABSTRACT**  
Hyperspectral imagery contains abundant spectral information beyond the visible RGB bands, providing rich discriminative details about objects in a scene. Leveraging such data has the potential to enhance visual tracking performance. While prior hyperspectral trackers employ CNN or hybrid CNN-Transformer architectures, we propose a novel approach HPFormer on Transformers to capitalize on their powerful representation learning capabilities. The core of HPFormer is a Hyperspectral Hybrid Attention (HHA) module which unifies feature extraction and fusion within one component through token interactions. Additionally, a Transform Band Module (TBM) is introduced to selectively aggregate spatial details and spectral signatures from the full hyperspectral input for injecting informative target representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of HPFormer on benchmark NIR and VIS tracking datasets. Our work provides new insights into harnessing the strengths of transformers and hyperspectral fusion to advance robust object tracking.

**ABSTRACT**  
Accurately detecting objects in the environment is a key challenge for autonomous vehicles. However, obtaining annotated data for detection is expensive and time-consuming. We introduce PatchContrast, a novel self-supervised point cloud pre-training framework for 3D object detection. We propose to utilize two levels of abstraction to learn discriminative representation from unlabeled data: proposal-level and patch-level. The proposal-level aims at localizing objects in relation to their surroundings, whereas the patch-level adds information about the internal connections between the object's components, hence distinguishing between different objects based on their individual components. We demonstrate how these levels can be integrated into self-supervised pre-training for various backbones to enhance the downstream 3D detection task. We show that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art models on three commonly-used 3D detection datasets.

**ABSTRACT**  
Nearest neighbor (NN) sampling provides more semantic variations than pre-defined transformations for self-supervised learning (SSL) based image recognition problems. However, its performance is restricted by the quality of the support set, which holds positive samples for the contrastive loss. In this work, we show that the quality of the support set plays a crucial role in any nearest neighbor based method for SSL. We then provide a refined baseline (pNNCLR) to the nearest neighbor based SSL approach (NNCLR). To this end, we introduce pseudo nearest neighbors (pNN) to control the quality of the support set, wherein, rather than sampling the nearest neighbors, we sample in the vicinity of hard nearest neighbors by varying the magnitude of the resultant vector and employing a stochastic sampling strategy to improve the performance. Additionally, to stabilize the effects of uncertainty in NN-based learning, we employ a smooth-weight-update approach for training the proposed network. Evaluation of the proposed method on multiple public image recognition and medical image recognition datasets shows that it performs up to 8 percent better than the baseline nearest neighbor method, and is comparable to other previously proposed SSL methods.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recent DETR-based video grounding models have made the model directly predict moment timestamps without any hand-crafted components, such as a pre-defined proposal or non-maximum suppression, by learning moment queries. However, their input-agnostic moment queries inevitably overlook an intrinsic temporal structure of a video, providing limited positional information. In this paper, we formulate an event-aware dynamic moment query to enable the model to take the input-specific content and positional information of the video into account. To this end, we present two levels of reasoning: 1) Event reasoning that captures distinctive event units constituting a given video using a slot attention mechanism; and 2) moment reasoning that fuses the moment queries with a given sentence through a gated fusion transformer layer and learns interactions between the moment queries and video-sentence representations to predict moment timestamps. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the event-aware dynamic moment queries, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches on several video grounding benchmarks.

**ABSTRACT**  
Lip-based biometric authentication (LBBA) is an authentication method based on a person's lip movements during speech in the form of video data captured by a camera sensor. LBBA can utilize both physical and behavioral characteristics of lip movements without requiring any additional sensory equipment apart from an RGB camera. State-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches use one-shot learning to train deep siamese neural networks which produce an embedding vector out of these features. Embeddings are further used to compute the similarity between an enrolled user and a user being authenticated. A flaw of these approaches is that they model behavioral features as style-of-speech without relation to what is being said. This makes the system vulnerable to video replay attacks of the client speaking any phrase. To solve this problem we propose a one-shot approach which models behavioral features to discriminate against what is being said in addition to style-of-speech. We achieve this by customizing the GRID dataset to obtain required triplets and training a siamese neural network based on 3D convolutions and recurrent neural network layers. A custom triplet loss for batch-wise hard-negative mining is proposed. Obtained results using an open-set protocol are 3.2% FAR and 3.8% FRR on the test set of the customized GRID dataset. Additional analysis of the results was done to quantify the influence and discriminatory power of behavioral and physical features for LBBA.

**ABSTRACT**  
Transformer-based visual trackers have demonstrated significant progress owing to their superior modeling capabilities. However, existing trackers are hampered by low speed, limiting their applicability on devices with limited computational power. To alleviate this problem, we propose HiT, a new family of efficient tracking models that can run at high speed on different devices while retaining high performance. The central idea of HiT is the Bridge Module, which bridges the gap between modern lightweight transformers and the tracking framework. The Bridge Module incorporates the high-level information of deep features into the shallow large-resolution features. In this way, it produces better features for the tracking head. We also propose a novel dual-image position encoding technique that simultaneously encodes the position information of both the search region and template images. The HiT model achieves promising speed with competitive performance. For instance, it runs at 61 frames per second (fps) on the Nvidia Jetson AGX edge device. Furthermore, HiT attains 64.6% AUC on the LaSOT benchmark, surpassing all previous efficient trackers.

**ABSTRACT**  
Zero-shot video recognition (ZSVR) is a task that aims to recognize video categories that have not been seen during the model training process. Recently, vision-language models (VLMs) pre-trained on large-scale image-text pairs have demonstrated impressive transferability for ZSVR. To make VLMs applicable to the video domain, existing methods often use an additional temporal learning module after the image-level encoder to learn the temporal relationships among video frames. Unfortunately, for video from unseen categories, we observe an abnormal phenomenon where the model that uses spatial-temporal feature performs much worse than the model that removes temporal learning module and uses only spatial feature. We conjecture that improper temporal modeling on video disrupts the spatial feature of the video. To verify our hypothesis, we propose Feature Factorization to retain the orthogonal temporal feature of the video and use interpolation to construct refined spatial-temporal feature. The model using appropriately refined spatial-temporal feature performs better than the one using only spatial feature, which verifies the effectiveness of the orthogonal temporal feature for the ZSVR task. Therefore, an Orthogonal Temporal Interpolation module is designed to learn a better refined spatial-temporal video feature during training. Additionally, a Matching Loss is introduced to improve the quality of the orthogonal temporal feature. We propose a model called OTI for ZSVR by employing orthogonal temporal interpolation and the matching loss based on VLMs. The ZSVR accuracies on popular video datasets (i.e., Kinetics-600, UCF101 and HMDB51) show that OTI outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method by a clear margin.

**ABSTRACT**  
The criticality of prompt and precise traffic forecasting in optimizing traffic flow management in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) has drawn substantial scholarly focus. Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) have been lauded for their adaptability to road graph structures. Yet, current research on STGNNs architectures often prioritizes complex designs, leading to elevated computational burdens with only minor enhancements in accuracy. To address this issue, we propose ST-MLP, a concise spatio-temporal model solely based on cascaded Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) modules and linear layers. Specifically, we incorporate temporal information, spatial information and predefined graph structure with a successful implementation of the channel-independence strategy - an effective technique in time series forecasting. Empirical results demonstrate that ST-MLP outperforms state-of-the-art STGNNs and other models in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency. Our finding encourages further exploration of more concise and effective neural network architectures in the field of traffic forecasting.

**ABSTRACT**  
Atmospheric nitrogen oxides (NOx) primarily from fuel combustion have recognized acute and chronic health and environmental effects. Machine learning (ML) methods have significantly enhanced our capacity to predict NOx concentrations at ground-level with high spatiotemporal resolution but may suffer from high estimation bias since they lack physical and chemical knowledge about air pollution dynamics. Chemical transport models (CTMs) leverage this knowledge; however, accurate predictions of ground-level concentrations typically necessitate extensive post-calibration. Here, we present a physics-informed deep learning framework that encodes advection-diffusion mechanisms and fluid dynamics constraints to jointly predict NO2 and NOx and reduce ML model bias by 21-42%. Our approach captures fine-scale transport of NO2 and NOx, generates robust spatial extrapolation, and provides explicit uncertainty estimation. The framework fuses knowledge-driven physicochemical principles of CTMs with the predictive power of ML for air quality exposure, health, and policy applications. Our approach offers significant improvements over purely data-driven ML methods and has unprecedented bias reduction in joint NO2 and NOx prediction.

**ABSTRACT**  
Accurate prediction of vehicle trajectories is vital for advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous vehicles. Existing methods mainly rely on generic trajectory predictions derived from large datasets, overlooking the personalized driving patterns of individual drivers. To address this gap, we propose an approach for interaction-aware personalized vehicle trajectory prediction that incorporates temporal graph neural networks. Our method utilizes Graph Convolution Networks (GCN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to model the spatio-temporal interactions between target vehicles and their surrounding traffic. To personalize the predictions, we establish a pipeline that leverages transfer learning: the model is initially pre-trained on a large-scale trajectory dataset and then fine-tuned for each driver using their specific driving data. We employ human-in-the-loop simulation to collect personalized naturalistic driving trajectories and corresponding surrounding vehicle trajectories. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our personalized GCN-LSTM model, particularly for longer prediction horizons, compared to its generic counterpart. Moreover, the personalized model outperforms individual models created without pre-training, emphasizing the significance of pre-training on a large dataset to avoid overfitting. By incorporating personalization, our approach enhances trajectory prediction accuracy.

**ABSTRACT**  
We present a comprehensive examination of score-based diffusion models of AI for generating synthetic images. These models hinge upon a dynamic auxiliary time mechanism driven by stochastic differential equations, wherein the score function is acquired from input images. Our investigation unveils a criterion for evaluating efficiency of the score-based diffusion models: the power of the generative process depends on the ability to de-construct fast correlations during the reverse/de-noising phase. To improve the quality of the produced synthetic images, we introduce an approach coined "U-Turn Diffusion". The U-Turn Diffusion technique starts with the standard forward diffusion process, albeit with a condensed duration compared to conventional settings. Subsequently, we execute the standard reverse dynamics, initialized with the concluding configuration from the forward process. This U-Turn Diffusion procedure, combining forward, U-turn, and reverse processes, creates a synthetic image approximating an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) sample from the probability distribution implicitly described via input samples. To analyze relevant time scales we employ various analytical tools, including auto-correlation analysis, weighted norm of the score-function analysis, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov Gaussianity test. The tools guide us to establishing that the Kernel Intersection Distance, a metric comparing the quality of synthetic samples with real data samples, is minimized at the optimal U-turn time.

**ABSTRACT**  
Prompt-based pre-trained language models (PLMs) paradigm have succeeded substantially in few-shot natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, prior discrete prompt optimization methods require expert knowledge to design the base prompt set and identify high-quality prompts, which is costly, inefficient, and subjective. Meanwhile, existing continuous prompt optimization methods improve the performance by learning the ideal prompts through the gradient information of PLMs, whose high computational cost, and low readability and generalizability are often concerning. To address the research gap, we propose a Dialogue-comprised Policy-gradient-based Discrete Prompt Optimization ($DP_2O$) method. We first design a multi-round dialogue alignment strategy for readability prompt set generation based on GPT-4. Furthermore, we propose an efficient prompt screening metric to identify high-quality prompts with linear complexity. Finally, we construct a reinforcement learning (RL) framework based on policy gradients to match the prompts to inputs optimally. By training a policy network with only 0.67% of the PLM parameter size on the tasks in the few-shot setting, $DP_2O$ outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) method by 1.52% in accuracy on average on four open-source datasets. Moreover, subsequent experiments also demonstrate that $DP_2O$ has good universality, robustness, and generalization ability.

**ABSTRACT**  
The Rash\=omon effect poses challenges for deriving reliable knowledge from machine learning models. This study examined the influence of sample size on explanations from models in a Rash\=omon set using SHAP. Experiments on 5 public datasets showed that explanations gradually converged as the sample size increased. Explanations from <128 samples exhibited high variability, limiting reliable knowledge extraction. However, agreement between models improved with more data, allowing for consensus. Bagging ensembles often had higher agreement. The results provide guidance on sufficient data to trust explanations. Variability at low samples suggests that conclusions may be unreliable without validation. Further work is needed with more model types, data domains, and explanation methods. Testing convergence in neural networks and with model-specific explanation methods would be impactful. The approaches explored here point towards principled techniques for eliciting knowledge from ambiguous models.

**ABSTRACT**  
Structured pruning and quantization are promising approaches for reducing the inference time and memory footprint of neural networks. However, most existing methods require the original training dataset to fine-tune the model. This not only brings heavy resource consumption but also is not possible for applications with sensitive or proprietary data due to privacy and security concerns. Therefore, a few data-free methods are proposed to address this problem, but they perform data-free pruning and quantization separately, which does not explore the complementarity of pruning and quantization. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named Unified Data-Free Compression(UDFC), which performs pruning and quantization simultaneously without any data and fine-tuning process. Specifically, UDFC starts with the assumption that the partial information of a damaged(e.g., pruned or quantized) channel can be preserved by a linear combination of other channels, and then derives the reconstruction form from the assumption to restore the information loss due to compression. Finally, we formulate the reconstruction error between the original network and its compressed network, and theoretically deduce the closed-form solution. We evaluate the UDFC on the large-scale image classification task and obtain significant improvements over various network architectures and compression methods. For example, we achieve a 20.54% accuracy improvement on ImageNet dataset compared to SOTA method with 30% pruning ratio and 6-bit quantization on ResNet-34.

**ABSTRACT**  
In the past years, the application of neural networks as an alternative to classical numerical methods to solve Partial Differential Equations has emerged as a potential paradigm shift in this century-old mathematical field. However, in terms of practical applicability, computational cost remains a substantial bottleneck. Classical approaches try to mitigate this challenge by limiting the spatial resolution on which the PDEs are defined. For neural PDE solvers, we can do better: Here, we investigate the potential of state-of-the-art quantization methods on reducing computational costs. We show that quantizing the network weights and activations can successfully lower the computational cost of inference while maintaining performance. Our results on four standard PDE datasets and three network architectures show that quantization-aware training works across settings and three orders of FLOPs magnitudes. Finally, we empirically demonstrate that Pareto-optimality of computational cost vs performance is almost always achieved only by incorporating quantization.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown its unprecedented success in many graph-related tasks. However, GNNs face the label scarcity issue as other neural networks do. Thus, recent efforts try to pre-train GNNs on a large-scale unlabeled graph and adapt the knowledge from the unlabeled graph to the target downstream task. The adaptation is generally achieved by fine-tuning the pre-trained GNNs with a limited number of labeled data. Despite the importance of fine-tuning, current GNNs pre-training works often ignore designing a good fine-tuning strategy to better leverage transferred knowledge and improve the performance on downstream tasks. Only few works start to investigate a better fine-tuning strategy for pre-trained GNNs. But their designs either have strong assumptions or overlook the data-aware issue for various downstream datasets. Therefore, we aim to design a better fine-tuning strategy for pre-trained GNNs to improve the model performance in this paper. Given a pre-trained GNN, we propose to search to fine-tune pre-trained graph neural networks for graph-level tasks (S2PGNN), which adaptively design a suitable fine-tuning framework for the given labeled data on the downstream task. To ensure the improvement brought by searching fine-tuning strategy, we carefully summarize a proper search space of fine-tuning framework that is suitable for GNNs. The empirical studies show that S2PGNN can be implemented on the top of 10 famous pre-trained GNNs and consistently improve their performance. Besides, S2PGNN achieves better performance than existing fine-tuning strategies within and outside the GNN area.

**ABSTRACT**  
In real-world datasets, noisy labels are pervasive. The challenge of learning with noisy labels (LNL) is to train a classifier that discerns the actual classes from given instances. For this, the model must identify features indicative of the authentic labels. While research indicates that genuine label information is embedded in the learned features of even inaccurately labeled data, it's often intertwined with noise, complicating its direct application. Addressing this, we introduce channel-wise contrastive learning (CWCL). This method distinguishes authentic label information from noise by undertaking contrastive learning across diverse channels. Unlike conventional instance-wise contrastive learning (IWCL), CWCL tends to yield more nuanced and resilient features aligned with the authentic labels. Our strategy is twofold: firstly, using CWCL to extract pertinent features to identify cleanly labeled samples, and secondly, progressively fine-tuning using these samples. Evaluations on several benchmark datasets validate our method's superiority over existing approaches.

**ABSTRACT**  
Online continual learning (CL) aims to learn new knowledge and consolidate previously learned knowledge from non-stationary data streams. Due to the time-varying training setting, the model learned from a changing distribution easily forgets the previously learned knowledge and biases toward the newly received task. To address this problem, we propose a Continual Bias Adaptor (CBA) module to augment the classifier network to adapt to catastrophic distribution change during training, such that the classifier network is able to learn a stable consolidation of previously learned tasks. In the testing stage, CBA can be removed which introduces no additional computation cost and memory overhead. We theoretically reveal the reason why the proposed method can effectively alleviate catastrophic distribution shifts, and empirically demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive experiments based on four rehearsal-based baselines and three public continual learning benchmarks.

**ABSTRACT**  
Large language models have made significant strides in natural language processing, paving the way for innovative applications including molecular representation and generation. However, most existing single-modality approaches cannot capture the abundant and complex information in molecular data. Here, we introduce GIT-Mol, a multi-modal large language model that integrates the structure Graph, Image, and Text information, including the Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) and molecular captions. To facilitate the integration of multi-modal molecular data, we propose GIT-Former, a novel architecture capable of mapping all modalities into a unified latent space. Our study develops an innovative any-to-language molecular translation strategy and achieves a 10%-15% improvement in molecular captioning, a 5%-10% accuracy increase in property prediction, and a 20% boost in molecule generation validity compared to baseline or single-modality models.

**ABSTRACT**  
Many machine translation toolkits make use of a data preparation step wherein raw data is transformed into a tensor format that can be used directly by the trainer. This preparation step is increasingly at odds with modern research and development practices because this process produces a static, unchangeable version of the training data, making common training-time needs difficult (e.g., subword sampling), time-consuming (preprocessing with large data can take days), expensive (e.g., disk space), and cumbersome (managing experiment combinatorics). We propose an alternative approach that separates the generation of data from the consumption of that data. In this approach, there is no separate pre-processing step; data generation produces an infinite stream of permutations of the raw training data, which the trainer tensorizes and batches as it is consumed. Additionally, this data stream can be manipulated by a set of user-definable operators that provide on-the-fly modifications, such as data normalization, augmentation or filtering. We release an open-source toolkit, SOTASTREAM, that implements this approach: https://github.com/marian-nmt/sotastream. We show that it cuts training time, adds flexibility, reduces experiment management complexity, and reduces disk space, all without affecting the accuracy of the trained models.

**ABSTRACT**  
The introduction of Artificial Intelligence (AI) generative language models such as GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) and tools such as ChatGPT has triggered a revolution that can transform how text is generated. This has many implications, for example, as AI-generated text becomes a significant fraction of the text in many disciplines, would this have an effect on the language capabilities of readers and also on the training of newer AI tools? Would it affect the evolution of languages? Focusing on one specific aspect of the language: words; will the use of tools such as ChatGPT increase or reduce the vocabulary used or the lexical richness (understood as the number of different words used in a written or oral production) when writing a given text? This has implications for words, as those not included in AI-generated content will tend to be less and less popular and may eventually be lost. In this work, we perform an initial comparison of the vocabulary and lexical richness of ChatGPT and humans when performing the same tasks. In more detail, two datasets containing the answers to different types of questions answered by ChatGPT and humans are used, and the analysis shows that ChatGPT tends to use fewer distinct words and lower lexical richness than humans. These results are very preliminary and additional datasets and ChatGPT configurations have to be evaluated to extract more general conclusions. Therefore, further research is needed to understand how the use of ChatGPT and more broadly generative AI tools will affect the vocabulary and lexical richness in different types of text and languages.

**ABSTRACT**  
In collaboration with Postpartum Support International (PSI), a non-profit organization dedicated to supporting caregivers with postpartum mood and anxiety disorders, we developed three chatbots to provide context-specific empathetic support to postpartum caregivers, leveraging both rule-based and generative models. We present and evaluate the performance of our chatbots using both machine-based metrics and human-based questionnaires. Overall, our rule-based model achieves the best performance, with outputs that are close to ground truth reference and contain the highest levels of empathy. Human users prefer the rule-based chatbot over the generative chatbot for its context-specific and human-like replies. Our generative chatbot also produced empathetic responses and was described by human users as engaging. However, limitations in the training dataset often result in confusing or nonsensical responses. We conclude by discussing practical benefits of rule-based vs. generative models for supporting individuals with mental health challenges. In light of the recent surge of ChatGPT and BARD, we also discuss the possibilities and pitfalls of large language models for digital mental healthcare.

**ABSTRACT**  
Accurate recognition of specific categories, such as persons' names, dates or other identifiers is critical in many Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) applications. As these categories represent personal information, ethical use of this data including collection, transcription, training and evaluation demands special care. One way of ensuring the security and privacy of individuals is to redact or eliminate Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from collection altogether. However, this results in ASR models that tend to have lower recognition accuracy of these categories. We use text-injection to improve the recognition of PII categories by including fake textual substitutes of PII categories in the training data using a text injection method. We demonstrate substantial improvement to Recall of Names and Dates in medical notes while improving overall WER. For alphanumeric digit sequences we show improvements to Character Error Rate and Sentence Accuracy.

**ABSTRACT**  
We present $\textbf{Platypus}$, a family of fine-tuned and merged Large Language Models (LLMs) that achieves the strongest performance and currently stands at first place in HuggingFace's Open LLM Leaderboard as of the release date of this work. In this work we describe (1) our curated dataset $\textbf{Open-Platypus}$, that is a subset of other open datasets and which $\textit{we release to the public}$ (2) our process of fine-tuning and merging LoRA modules in order to conserve the strong prior of pretrained LLMs, while bringing specific domain knowledge to the surface (3) our efforts in checking for test data leaks and contamination in the training data, which can inform future research. Specifically, the Platypus family achieves strong performance in quantitative LLM metrics across model sizes, topping the global Open LLM leaderboard while using just a fraction of the fine-tuning data and overall compute that are required for other state-of-the-art fine-tuned LLMs. In particular, a 13B Platypus model can be trained on $\textit{a single}$ A100 GPU using 25k questions in 5 hours. This is a testament of the quality of our Open-Platypus dataset, and opens opportunities for more improvements in the field. Project page: https://platypus-llm.github.io

**ABSTRACT**  
Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, PaLM, and Llama have significantly propelled the generation of AI-crafted text. With rising concerns about their potential misuse, there is a pressing need for AI-generated-text forensics. Neural authorship attribution is a forensic effort, seeking to trace AI-generated text back to its originating LLM. The LLM landscape can be divided into two primary categories: proprietary and open-source. In this work, we delve into these emerging categories of LLMs, focusing on the nuances of neural authorship attribution. To enrich our understanding, we carry out an empirical analysis of LLM writing signatures, highlighting the contrasts between proprietary and open-source models, and scrutinizing variations within each group. By integrating stylometric features across lexical, syntactic, and structural aspects of language, we explore their potential to yield interpretable results and augment pre-trained language model-based classifiers utilized in neural authorship attribution. Our findings, based on a range of state-of-the-art LLMs, provide empirical insights into neural authorship attribution, paving the way for future investigations aimed at mitigating the threats posed by AI-generated misinformation.

**ABSTRACT**  
Automatic evaluation of machine translation (MT) is a critical tool driving the rapid iterative development of MT systems. While considerable progress has been made on estimating a single scalar quality score, current metrics lack the informativeness of more detailed schemes that annotate individual errors, such as Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM). In this paper, we help fill this gap by proposing AutoMQM, a prompting technique which leverages the reasoning and in-context learning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and asks them to identify and categorize errors in translations. We start by evaluating recent LLMs, such as PaLM and PaLM-2, through simple score prediction prompting, and we study the impact of labeled data through in-context learning and finetuning. We then evaluate AutoMQM with PaLM-2 models, and we find that it improves performance compared to just prompting for scores (with particularly large gains for larger models) while providing interpretability through error spans that align with human annotations.

**ABSTRACT**  
Large Language Models (LLMs) usually suffer from knowledge cutoff or fallacy issues, which means they are unaware of unseen events or generate text with incorrect facts owing to the outdated/noisy data. To this end, many knowledge editing approaches for LLMs have emerged -- aiming to subtly inject/edit updated knowledge or adjust undesired behavior while minimizing the impact on unrelated inputs. Nevertheless, due to significant differences among various knowledge editing methods and the variations in task setups, there is no standard implementation framework available for the community, which hinders practitioners to apply knowledge editing to applications. To address these issues, we propose EasyEdit, an easy-to-use knowledge editing framework for LLMs. It supports various cutting-edge knowledge editing approaches and can be readily apply to many well-known LLMs such as T5, GPT-J, LlaMA, etc. Empirically, we report the knowledge editing results on LlaMA-2 with EasyEdit, demonstrating that knowledge editing surpasses traditional fine-tuning in terms of reliability and generalization. We have released the source code on GitHub at https://github.com/zjunlp/EasyEdit, along with Google Colab tutorials and comprehensive documentation for beginners to get started. Besides, we present an online system for real-time knowledge editing, and a demo video at http://knowlm.zjukg.cn/easyedit.mp4.

**ABSTRACT**  
Finetuning large language models (LLMs) on instructions leads to vast performance improvements on natural language tasks. We apply instruction tuning using code, leveraging the natural structure of Git commits, which pair code changes with human instructions. We compile CommitPack: 4 terabytes of Git commits across 350 programming languages. We benchmark CommitPack against other natural and synthetic code instructions (xP3x, Self-Instruct, OASST) on the 16B parameter StarCoder model, and achieve state-of-the-art performance among models not trained on OpenAI outputs, on the HumanEval Python benchmark (46.2% pass@1). We further introduce HumanEvalPack, expanding the HumanEval benchmark to a total of 3 coding tasks (Code Repair, Code Explanation, Code Synthesis) across 6 languages (Python, JavaScript, Java, Go, C++, Rust). Our models, OctoCoder and OctoGeeX, achieve the best performance across HumanEvalPack among all permissive models, demonstrating CommitPack's benefits in generalizing to a wider set of languages and natural coding tasks.

**ABSTRACT**  
The emergence of large-scale pre-trained language models, such as ChatGPT, has revolutionized various research fields in artificial intelligence. Transformers-based large language models (LLMs) have gradually replaced CNNs and RNNs to unify fields of computer vision and natural language processing. Compared with the data that exists relatively independently such as images, videos or texts, graph is a type of data that contains rich structural and relational information. Meanwhile, natural language, as one of the most expressive mediums, excels in describing complex structures. However, existing work on incorporating graph learning problems into the generative language modeling framework remains very limited. As the importance of language models continues to grow, it becomes essential to explore whether LLMs can also replace GNNs as the foundational model for graphs. In this paper, we propose InstructGLM (Instruction-finetuned Graph Language Model), systematically design highly scalable prompts based on natural language instructions, and use natural language to describe the geometric structure and node features of the graph for instruction tuning an LLMs to perform learning and inference on graphs in a generative manner. Our method exceeds all competitive GNN baselines on ogbn-arxiv, Cora and PubMed datasets, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our method and sheds light on generative language models replacing GNNs as the foundation model for graph machine learning.

**ABSTRACT**  
Much of the recent discourse within the NLP research community has been centered around Large Language Models (LLMs), their functionality and potential -- yet not only do we not have a working definition of LLMs, but much of this discourse relies on claims and assumptions that are worth re-examining. This position paper contributes a definition of LLMs, explicates some of the assumptions made regarding their functionality, and outlines the existing evidence for and against them. We conclude with suggestions for research directions and their framing in future work.

**ABSTRACT**  
As a primary means of information acquisition, information retrieval (IR) systems, such as search engines, have integrated themselves into our daily lives. These systems also serve as components of dialogue, question-answering, and recommender systems. The trajectory of IR has evolved dynamically from its origins in term-based methods to its integration with advanced neural models. While the neural models excel at capturing complex contextual signals and semantic nuances, thereby reshaping the IR landscape, they still face challenges such as data scarcity, interpretability, and the generation of contextually plausible yet potentially inaccurate responses. This evolution requires a combination of both traditional methods (such as term-based sparse retrieval methods with rapid response) and modern neural architectures (such as language models with powerful language understanding capacity). Meanwhile, the emergence of large language models (LLMs), typified by ChatGPT and GPT-4, has revolutionized natural language processing due to their remarkable language understanding, generation, generalization, and reasoning abilities. Consequently, recent research has sought to leverage LLMs to improve IR systems. Given the rapid evolution of this research trajectory, it is necessary to consolidate existing methodologies and provide nuanced insights through a comprehensive overview. In this survey, we delve into the confluence of LLMs and IR systems, including crucial aspects such as query rewriters, retrievers, rerankers, and readers. Additionally, we explore promising directions within this expanding field.

**ABSTRACT**  
Foundation language models obtain the instruction-following ability through supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Diversity and complexity are considered critical factors of a successful SFT dataset, while their definitions remain obscure and lack quantitative analyses. In this work, we propose InsTag, an open-set fine-grained tagger, to tag samples within SFT datasets based on semantics and intentions and define instruction diversity and complexity regarding tags. We obtain 6.6K tags to describe comprehensive user queries. Then we analyze popular open-sourced SFT datasets and find that the model ability grows with more diverse and complex data. Based on this observation, we propose a data selector based on InsTag to select 6K diverse and complex samples from open-source datasets and fine-tune models on InsTag-selected data. The resulting models, TagLM, outperform open-source models based on considerably larger SFT data evaluated by MT-Bench, echoing the importance of query diversity and complexity. We open-source InsTag in https://github.com/OFA-Sys/InsTag.

**ABSTRACT**  
Knowledge Graph (KG)-to-Text Generation has seen recent improvements in generating fluent and informative sentences which describe a given KG. As KGs are widespread across multiple domains and contain important entity-relation information, and as text simplification aims to reduce the complexity of a text while preserving the meaning of the original text, we propose KGSimple, a novel approach to unsupervised text simplification which infuses KG-established techniques in order to construct a simplified KG path and generate a concise text which preserves the original input's meaning. Through an iterative and sampling KG-first approach, our model is capable of simplifying text when starting from a KG by learning to keep important information while harnessing KG-to-text generation to output fluent and descriptive sentences. We evaluate various settings of the KGSimple model on currently-available KG-to-text datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness compared to unsupervised text simplification models which start with a given complex text. Our code is available on GitHub.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recently, instruction-following Large Language Models (LLMs) , represented by ChatGPT, have exhibited exceptional performance in general Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. However, the unique characteristics of E-commerce data pose significant challenges to general LLMs. An LLM tailored specifically for E-commerce scenarios, possessing robust cross-dataset/task generalization capabilities, is a pressing necessity. To solve this issue, in this work, we proposed the first e-commerce instruction dataset EcomInstruct, with a total of 2.5 million instruction data. EcomInstruct scales up the data size and task diversity by constructing atomic tasks with E-commerce basic data types, such as product information, user reviews. Atomic tasks are defined as intermediate tasks implicitly involved in solving a final task, which we also call Chain-of-Task tasks. We developed EcomGPT with different parameter scales by training the backbone model BLOOMZ with the EcomInstruct. Benefiting from the fundamental semantic understanding capabilities acquired from the Chain-of-Task tasks, EcomGPT exhibits excellent zero-shot generalization capabilities. Extensive experiments and human evaluations demonstrate that EcomGPT outperforms ChatGPT in term of cross-dataset/task generalization on E-commerce tasks.

**ABSTRACT**  
Fine-grained, span-level human evaluation has emerged as a reliable and robust method for evaluating text generation tasks such as summarization, simplification, machine translation and news generation, and the derived annotations have been useful for training automatic metrics and improving language models. However, existing annotation tools implemented for these evaluation frameworks lack the adaptability to be extended to different domains or languages, or modify annotation settings according to user needs. And the absence of a unified annotated data format inhibits the research in multi-task learning. In this paper, we introduce Thresh, a unified, customizable and deployable platform for fine-grained evaluation. By simply creating a YAML configuration file, users can build and test an annotation interface for any framework within minutes -- all in one web browser window. To facilitate collaboration and sharing, Thresh provides a community hub that hosts a collection of fine-grained frameworks and corresponding annotations made and collected by the community, covering a wide range of NLP tasks. For deployment, Thresh offers multiple options for any scale of annotation projects from small manual inspections to large crowdsourcing ones. Additionally, we introduce a Python library to streamline the entire process from typology design and deployment to annotation processing. Thresh is publicly accessible at https://thresh.tools.

**ABSTRACT**  
We introduce generative interpretation, a new approach to estimating contractual meaning using large language models. As AI triumphalism is the order of the day, we proceed by way of grounded case studies, each illustrating the capabilities of these novel tools in distinct ways. Taking well-known contracts opinions, and sourcing the actual agreements that they adjudicated, we show that AI models can help factfinders ascertain ordinary meaning in context, quantify ambiguity, and fill gaps in parties' agreements. We also illustrate how models can calculate the probative value of individual pieces of extrinsic evidence. After offering best practices for the use of these models given their limitations, we consider their implications for judicial practice and contract theory. Using LLMs permits courts to estimate what the parties intended cheaply and accurately, and as such generative interpretation unsettles the current interpretative stalemate. Their use responds to efficiency-minded textualists and justice-oriented contextualists, who argue about whether parties will prefer cost and certainty or accuracy and fairness. Parties--and courts--would prefer a middle path, in which adjudicators strive to predict what the contract really meant, admitting just enough context to approximate reality while avoiding unguided and biased assimilation of evidence. As generative interpretation offers this possibility, we argue it can become the new workhorse of contractual interpretation.

**ABSTRACT**  
Silicon photonics (SiPh) has different applications, from enabling fast and high-bandwidth communication for high-performance computing systems to realizing energy-efficient optical computation for AI hardware accelerators. However, integrating SiPh with electronic sub-systems can introduce new security vulnerabilities that cannot be adequately addressed using existing hardware security solutions for electronic systems. This paper introduces SerIOS, the first framework aimed at enhancing hardware security in optoelectronic systems by leveraging the unique properties of optical lithography. SerIOS employs cryptographic keys generated based on imperfections in the optical lithography process and an online detection mechanism to detect attacks. Simulation and synthesis results demonstrate SerIOS's effectiveness in detecting and preventing attacks, with a small area footprint of less than 15% and a 100% detection rate across various attack scenarios and optoelectronic architectures, including photonic AI accelerators.

**ABSTRACT**  
There are more than 7,000 public transit agencies in the U.S. (and many more private agencies), and together, they are responsible for serving 60 billion passenger miles each year. A well-functioning transit system fosters the growth and expansion of businesses, distributes social and economic benefits, and links the capabilities of community members, thereby enhancing what they can accomplish as a society. Since affordable public transit services are the backbones of many communities, this work investigates ways in which Artificial Intelligence (AI) can improve efficiency and increase utilization from the perspective of transit agencies. This book chapter discusses the primary requirements, objectives, and challenges related to the design of AI-driven smart transportation systems. We focus on three major topics. First, we discuss data sources and data. Second, we provide an overview of how AI can aid decision-making with a focus on transportation. Lastly, we discuss computational problems in the transportation domain and AI approaches to these problems.

**ABSTRACT**  
The final frontier for simulation is the accurate representation of complex, real-world social systems. While agent-based modeling (ABM) seeks to study the behavior and interactions of agents within a larger system, it is unable to faithfully capture the full complexity of human-driven behavior. Large language models (LLMs), like ChatGPT, have emerged as a potential solution to this bottleneck by enabling researchers to explore human-driven interactions in previously unimaginable ways. Our research investigates simulations of human interactions using LLMs. Through prompt engineering, inspired by Park et al. (2023), we present two simulations of believable proxies of human behavior: a two-agent negotiation and a six-agent murder mystery game.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this work, we conceptualize the learning process as information compression. We seek to equip generative pre-trained models with human-like learning capabilities that enable data compression during inference. We present a novel approach that utilizes the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) to approximate Kolmogorov complexity, with the aim of estimating the optimal Information Distance for few-shot learning. We first propose using GPT as a prior for lossless text compression, achieving a noteworthy compression ratio. Experiment with LLAMA2-7B backbone achieves a compression ratio of 15.5 on enwik9. We justify the pre-training objective of GPT models by demonstrating its equivalence to the compression length, and, consequently, its ability to approximate the information distance for texts. Leveraging the approximated information distance, our method allows the direct application of GPT models in quantitative text similarity measurements. Experiment results show that our method overall achieves superior performance compared to embedding and prompt baselines on challenging NLP tasks, including semantic similarity, zero and one-shot text classification, and zero-shot text ranking.

**ABSTRACT**  
Packet scheduling is a fundamental networking task that recently received renewed attention in the context of programmable data planes. Programmable packet scheduling systems such as those based on Push-In First-Out (PIFO) abstraction enabled flexible scheduling policies, but are too resource-expensive for large-scale line rate operation. This prompted research into practical programmable schedulers (e.g., SP-PIFO, AIFO) approximating PIFO behavior on regular hardware. Yet, their scalability remains limited due to extensive number of memory operations. To address this, we design an effective yet resource-efficient packet scheduler, Range-In First-Out (RIFO), which uses only three mutable memory cells and one FIFO queue per PIFO queue. RIFO is based on multi-criteria decision-making principles and uses small guaranteed admission buffers. Our large-scale simulations in Netbench demonstrate that despite using fewer resources, RIFO generally achieves competitive flow completion times across all studied workloads, and is especially effective in workloads with a significant share of large flows, reducing flow completion time up to 2.9x in Datamining workloads compared to state-of-the-art solutions. Our prototype implementation using P4 on Tofino switches requires only 650 lines of code, is scalable, and runs at line rate.

**ABSTRACT**  
The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) network is popular these years due to its various applications. In the UAV network, routing is significantly affected by the distributed network topology, leading to the issue that UAVs are vulnerable to deliberate damage. Hence, this paper focuses on the routing plan and recovery for UAV networks with attacks. In detail, a deliberate attack model based on the importance of nodes is designed to represent enemy attacks. Then, a node importance ranking mechanism is presented, considering the degree of nodes and link importance. However, it is intractable to handle the routing problem by traditional methods for UAV networks, since link connections change with the UAV availability. Hence, an intelligent algorithm based on reinforcement learning is proposed to recover the routing path when UAVs are attacked. Simulations are conducted and numerical results verify the proposed mechanism performs better than other referred methods.

**ABSTRACT**  
Parkinson's disease (PD), a severe and progressive neurological illness, affects millions of individuals worldwide. For effective treatment and management of PD, an accurate and early diagnosis is crucial. This study presents a deep learning-based model for the diagnosis of PD using resting state electroencephalogram (EEG) signal. The objective of the study is to develop an automated model that can extract complex hidden nonlinear features from EEG and demonstrate its generalizability on unseen data. The model is designed using a hybrid model, consists of convolutional neural network (CNN), bidirectional gated recurrent unit (Bi-GRU), and attention mechanism. The proposed method is evaluated on three public datasets (Uc San Diego Dataset, PRED-CT, and University of Iowa (UI) dataset), with one dataset used for training and the other two for evaluation. The results show that the proposed model can accurately diagnose PD with high performance on both the training and hold-out datasets. The model also performs well even when some part of the input information is missing. The results of this work have significant implications for patient treatment and for ongoing investigations into the early detection of Parkinson's disease. The suggested model holds promise as a non-invasive and reliable technique for PD early detection utilizing resting state EEG.

**ABSTRACT**  
Radio frequency fingerprint identification (RFFI) is an emerging technique for the lightweight authentication of wireless Internet of things (IoT) devices. RFFI exploits unique hardware impairments as device identifiers, and deep learning is widely deployed as the feature extractor and classifier for RFFI. However, deep learning is vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where adversarial examples are generated by adding perturbation to clean data for causing the classifier to make wrong predictions. Deep learning-based RFFI has been shown to be vulnerable to such attacks, however, there is currently no exploration of effective adversarial attacks against a diversity of RFFI classifiers. In this paper, we report on investigations into white-box attacks (non-targeted and targeted) using two approaches, namely the fast gradient sign method (FGSM) and projected gradient descent (PGD). A LoRa testbed was built and real datasets were collected. These adversarial examples have been experimentally demonstrated to be effective against convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, and gated recurrent units (GRU).

**ABSTRACT**  
Crypto-wallets or digital asset wallets are a crucial aspect of managing cryptocurrencies and other digital assets such as NFTs. However, these wallets are not immune to security threats, particularly from the growing risk of quantum computing. The use of traditional public-key cryptography systems in digital asset wallets makes them vulnerable to attacks from quantum computers, which may increase in the future. Moreover, current digital wallets require users to keep track of seed-phrases, which can be challenging and lead to additional security risks. To overcome these challenges, a new algorithm is proposed that uses post-quantum cryptography (PQC) and zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) to enhance the security of digital asset wallets. The research focuses on the use of the Lattice-based Threshold Secret Sharing Scheme (LTSSS), Kyber Algorithm for key generation and ZKP for wallet unlocking, providing a more secure and user-friendly alternative to seed-phrase, brain and multi-sig protocol wallets. This algorithm also includes several innovative security features such as recovery of wallets in case of downtime of the server, and the ability to rekey the private key associated with a specific username-password combination, offering improved security and usability. The incorporation of PQC and ZKP provides a robust and comprehensive framework for securing digital assets in the present and future. This research aims to address the security challenges faced by digital asset wallets and proposes practical solutions to ensure their safety in the era of quantum computing.

**ABSTRACT**  
The adoption of cloud computing has brought significant advancements in the operational models of businesses. However, this shift also brings new security challenges by expanding the attack surface. The offered services in cloud computing have various service models. Each cloud service model has a defined responsibility divided based on the stack layers between the service user and their cloud provider. Regardless of its service model, each service is constructed from sub-components and services running on the underlying layers. In this paper, we aim to enable more transparency and visibility by designing an ontology that links the provider's services with the sub-components used to deliver the service. Such breakdown for each cloud service sub-components enables the end user to track the vulnerabilities on the service level or one of its sub-components. Such information can result in a better understanding and management of reported vulnerabilities on the sub-components level and their impact on the offered services by the cloud provider. Our ontology and source code are published as an open-source and accessible via GitHub: \href{https://github.com/mohkharma/cc-ontology}{mohkharma/cc-ontology}

**ABSTRACT**  
Filecoin is the largest storage-based open-source blockchain, both by storage capacity (>11EiB) and market capitalization. This paper provides the first formal security analysis of Filecoin's consensus (ordering) protocol, Expected Consensus (EC). Specifically, we show that EC is secure against an arbitrary adversary that controls a fraction $\beta$ of the total storage for $\beta m< 1- e^{-(1-\beta)m}$, where $m$ is a parameter that corresponds to the expected number of blocks per round, currently $m=5$ in Filecoin. We then present an attack, the $n$-split attack, where an adversary splits the honest miners between multiple chains, and show that it is successful for $\beta m \ge 1- e^{-(1-\beta)m}$, thus proving that $\beta m= 1- e^{-(1-\beta)m}$ is the tight security threshold of EC. This corresponds roughly to an adversary with $20\%$ of the total storage pledged to the chain. Finally, we propose two improvements to EC security that would increase this threshold. One of these two fixes is being implemented as a Filecoin Improvement Proposal (FIP).

**ABSTRACT**  
Securing critical assets in a bus-based System-On-Chip (SoC) is imperative to mitigate potential vulnerabilities and prevent unauthorized access, ensuring the integrity, availability, and confidentiality of the system. Ensuring security throughout the SoC design process is a formidable task owing to the inherent intricacies in SoC designs and the dispersion of assets across diverse IPs. Large Language Models (LLMs), exemplified by ChatGPT (OpenAI) and BARD (Google), have showcased remarkable proficiency across various domains, including security vulnerability detection and prevention in SoC designs. In this work, we propose DIVAS, a novel framework that leverages the knowledge base of LLMs to identify security vulnerabilities from user-defined SoC specifications, map them to the relevant Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs), followed by the generation of equivalent assertions, and employ security measures through enforcement of security policies. The proposed framework is implemented using multiple ChatGPT and BARD models, and their performance was analyzed while generating relevant CWEs from the SoC specifications provided. The experimental results obtained from open-source SoC benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed framework.

**ABSTRACT**  
As a typical entity of MEC (Mobile Edge Computing), 5G CPE (Customer Premise Equipment)/HGU (Home Gateway Unit) has proven to be a promising alternative to traditional Smart Home Gateway. Network TC (Traffic Classification) is a vital service quality assurance and security management method for communication networks, which has become a crucial functional entity in 5G CPE/HGU. In recent years, many researchers have applied Machine Learning or Deep Learning (DL) to TC, namely AI-TC, to improve its performance. However, AI-TC faces challenges, including data dependency, resource-intensive traffic labeling, and user privacy concerns. The limited computing resources of 5G CPE further complicate efficient classification. Moreover, the "black box" nature of AI-TC models raises transparency and credibility issues. The paper proposes the FedEdge AI-TC framework, leveraging Federated Learning (FL) for reliable Network TC in 5G CPE. FL ensures privacy by employing local training, model parameter iteration, and centralized training. A semi-supervised TC algorithm based on Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) and convolutional neural network (CNN) reduces data dependency while maintaining accuracy. To optimize model light-weight deployment, the paper introduces XAI-Pruning, an AI model compression method combined with DL model interpretability. Experimental evaluation demonstrates FedEdge AI-TC's superiority over benchmarks in terms of accuracy and efficient TC performance. The framework enhances user privacy and model credibility, offering a comprehensive solution for dependable and transparent Network TC in 5G CPE, thus enhancing service quality and security.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper presents an improved loss function for neural source code summarization. Code summarization is the task of writing natural language descriptions of source code. Neural code summarization refers to automated techniques for generating these descriptions using neural networks. Almost all current approaches involve neural networks as either standalone models or as part of a pretrained large language models e.g., GPT, Codex, LLaMA. Yet almost all also use a categorical cross-entropy (CCE) loss function for network optimization. Two problems with CCE are that 1) it computes loss over each word prediction one-at-a-time, rather than evaluating a whole sentence, and 2) it requires a perfect prediction, leaving no room for partial credit for synonyms. We propose and evaluate a loss function to alleviate this problem. In essence, we propose to use a semantic similarity metric to calculate loss over the whole output sentence prediction per training batch, rather than just loss for each word. We also propose to combine our loss with traditional CCE for each word, which streamlines the training process compared to baselines. We evaluate our approach over several baselines and report an improvement in the vast majority of conditions.

**ABSTRACT**  
Data management and analysis tasks are often carried out using spreadsheet software. A popular feature in most spreadsheet platforms is the ability to define data-dependent formatting rules. These rules can express actions such as "color red all entries in a column that are negative" or "bold all rows not containing error or failure." Unfortunately, users who want to exercise this functionality need to manually write these conditional formatting (CF) rules. We introduce CORNET, a system that automatically learns such conditional formatting rules from user examples. CORNET takes inspiration from inductive program synthesis and combines symbolic rule enumeration, based on semi-supervised clustering and iterative decision tree learning, with a neural ranker to produce accurate conditional formatting rules. In this demonstration, we show CORNET in action as a simple add-in to Microsoft Excel. After the user provides one or two formatted cells as examples, CORNET generates formatting rule suggestions for the user to apply to the spreadsheet.

**ABSTRACT**  
Offensive security-tests are a common way to pro-actively discover potential vulnerabilities. They are performed by specialists, often called penetration-testers or white-hat hackers. The chronic lack of available white-hat hackers prevents sufficient security test coverage of software. Research into automation tries to alleviate this problem by improving the efficiency of security testing. To achieve this, researchers and tool builders need a solid understanding of how hackers work, their assumptions, and pain points.   In this paper, we present a first data-driven exploratory qualitative study of twelve security professionals, their work and problems occurring therein. We perform a thematic analysis to gain insights into the execution of security assignments, hackers' thought processes and encountered challenges.   This analysis allows us to conclude with recommendations for researchers and tool builders to increase the efficiency of their automation and identify novel areas for research.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recently, deep learning-based techniques have shown promising performance on various tasks related to software engineering. For these learning-based approaches to perform well, obtaining high-quality data is one fundamental and crucial issue. The comment updating task is an emerging software engineering task aiming at automatically updating the corresponding comments based on changes in source code. However, datasets for the comment updating tasks are usually crawled from committed versions in open source software repositories such as GitHub, where there is lack of quality control of comments. In this paper, we focus on cleaning existing comment updating datasets with considering some properties of the comment updating process in software development. We propose a semantic and overlapping-aware approach named CupCleaner (Comment UPdating's CLEANER) to achieve this purpose. Specifically, we calculate a score based on semantics and overlapping information of the code and comments. Based on the distribution of the scores, we filter out the data with low scores in the tail of the distribution to get rid of possible unclean data. We first conducted a human evaluation on the noise data and high-quality data identified by CupCleaner. The results show that the human ratings of the noise data identified by CupCleaner are significantly lower. Then, we applied our data cleaning approach to the training and validation sets of three existing comment updating datasets while keeping the test set unchanged. Our experimental results show that even after filtering out over 30\% of the data using CupCleaner, there is still an improvement in all performance metrics. The experimental results on the cleaned test set also suggest that CupCleaner may provide help for constructing datasets for updating-related tasks.

**ABSTRACT**  
Path planning in obstacle-dense environments is a key challenge in robotics, and depends on inferring scene attributes and associated uncertainties. We present a multiple-hypothesis path planner designed to navigate complex environments using obstacle detections. Path hypotheses are generated by reasoning about uncertainty and range, as initial detections are typically at far ranges with high uncertainty, before subsequent detections reduce this uncertainty. Given estimated obstacles, we build a graph of pairwise connections between objects based on the probability that the robot can safely pass between the pair. The graph is updated in real time and pruned of unsafe paths, providing probabilistic safety guarantees. The planner generates path hypotheses over this graph, then trades between safety and path length to intelligently optimize the best route. We evaluate our planner on randomly generated simulated forests, and find that in the most challenging environments, it increases the navigation success rate over an A* baseline from 20% to 75%. Results indicate that the use of evolving, range-based uncertainty and multiple hypotheses are critical for navigating dense environments.

**ABSTRACT**  
Accomplishing household tasks such as 'bringing a cup of water' requires planning step-by-step actions by maintaining knowledge about the spatial arrangement of objects and the consequences of previous actions. Perception models of the current embodied AI agents, however, often make mistakes due to a lack of such knowledge but rely on imperfect learning of imitating agents or an algorithmic planner without knowledge about the changed environment by the previous actions. To address the issue, we propose CPEM (Context-aware Planner and Environment-aware Memory) to incorporate the contextual information of previous actions for planning and maintaining spatial arrangement of objects with their states (e.g., if an object has been moved or not) in an environment to the perception model for improving both visual navigation and object interaction. We observe that CPEM achieves state-of-the-art task success performance in various metrics using a challenging interactive instruction following benchmark both in seen and unseen environments by large margins (up to +10.70% in unseen env.). CPEM with the templated actions, named ECLAIR, also won the 1st generalist language grounding agents challenge at Embodied AI Workshop in CVPR'23.

**ABSTRACT**  
Sound Event Detection (SED) aims to predict the temporal boundaries of all the events of interest and their class labels, given an unconstrained audio sample. Taking either the splitand-classify (i.e., frame-level) strategy or the more principled event-level modeling approach, all existing methods consider the SED problem from the discriminative learning perspective. In this work, we reformulate the SED problem by taking a generative learning perspective. Specifically, we aim to generate sound temporal boundaries from noisy proposals in a denoising diffusion process, conditioned on a target audio sample. During training, our model learns to reverse the noising process by converting noisy latent queries to the groundtruth versions in the elegant Transformer decoder framework. Doing so enables the model generate accurate event boundaries from even noisy queries during inference. Extensive experiments on the Urban-SED and EPIC-Sounds datasets demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms existing alternatives, with 40+% faster convergence in training.

**ABSTRACT**  
We propose a method named AudioFormer,which learns audio feature representations through the acquisition of discrete acoustic codes and subsequently fine-tunes them for audio classification tasks. Initially,we introduce a novel perspective by considering the audio classification task as a form of natural language understanding (NLU). Leveraging an existing neural audio codec model,we generate discrete acoustic codes and utilize them to train a masked language model (MLM),thereby obtaining audio feature representations. Furthermore,we pioneer the integration of a Multi-Positive sample Contrastive (MPC) learning approach. This method enables the learning of joint representations among multiple discrete acoustic codes within the same audio input. In our experiments,we treat discrete acoustic codes as textual data and train a masked language model using a cloze-like methodology,ultimately deriving high-quality audio representations. Notably,the MPC learning technique effectively captures collaborative representations among distinct positive samples. Our research outcomes demonstrate that AudioFormer attains significantly improved performance compared to prevailing monomodal audio classification models across multiple datasets,and even outperforms audio-visual multimodal classification models on select datasets. Specifically,our approach achieves remarkable results on datasets including AudioSet (2M,20K),and FSD50K,with performance scores of 53.9,45.1,and 65.6,respectively. We have openly shared both the code and models: https://github.com/LZH-0225/AudioFormer.git.

**ABSTRACT**  
We propose a shift towards end-to-end learning in bird sound monitoring by combining self-supervised (SSL) and deep active learning (DAL). Leveraging transformer models, we aim to bypass traditional spectrogram conversions, enabling direct raw audio processing. ActiveBird2Vec is set to generate high-quality bird sound representations through SSL, potentially accelerating the assessment of environmental changes and decision-making processes for wind farms. Additionally, we seek to utilize the wide variety of bird vocalizations through DAL, reducing the reliance on extensively labeled datasets by human experts. We plan to curate a comprehensive set of tasks through Huggingface Datasets, enhancing future comparability and reproducibility of bioacoustic research. A comparative analysis between various transformer models will be conducted to evaluate their proficiency in bird sound recognition tasks. We aim to accelerate the progression of avian bioacoustic research and contribute to more effective conservation strategies.

**ABSTRACT**  
Over the past few years, deep learning has firmly established its prowess across various domains, including computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing. Motivated by its outstanding success, researchers have been directing their efforts towards applying deep learning techniques to recommender systems. Neural collaborative filtering (NCF) and Neural Matrix Factorization (NeuMF) refreshes the traditional inner product in matrix factorization with a neural architecture capable of learning complex and data-driven functions. While these models effectively capture user-item interactions, they overlook the specific attributes of both users and items. This can lead to robustness issues, especially for items and users that belong to the "long tail". Such challenges are commonly recognized in recommender systems as a part of the cold-start problem. A direct and intuitive approach to address this issue is by leveraging the features and attributes of the items and users themselves. In this paper, we introduce a refined NeuMF model that considers not only the interaction between users and items, but also acrossing associated attributes. Moreover, our proposed architecture features a shared user embedding, seamlessly integrating with user embeddings to imporve the robustness and effectively address the cold-start problem. Rigorous experiments on both the Movielens and Pinterest datasets demonstrate the superiority of our Cross-Attribute Matrix Factorization model, particularly in scenarios characterized by higher dataset sparsity.

**ABSTRACT**  
A large catalogue size is one of the central challenges in training recommendation models: a large number of items makes them memory and computationally inefficient to compute scores for all items during training, forcing these models to deploy negative sampling. However, negative sampling increases the proportion of positive interactions in the training data, and therefore models trained with negative sampling tend to overestimate the probabilities of positive interactions a phenomenon we call overconfidence. While the absolute values of the predicted scores or probabilities are not important for the ranking of retrieved recommendations, overconfident models may fail to estimate nuanced differences in the top-ranked items, resulting in degraded performance. In this paper, we show that overconfidence explains why the popular SASRec model underperforms when compared to BERT4Rec. This is contrary to the BERT4Rec authors explanation that the difference in performance is due to the bi-directional attention mechanism. To mitigate overconfidence, we propose a novel Generalised Binary Cross-Entropy Loss function (gBCE) and theoretically prove that it can mitigate overconfidence. We further propose the gSASRec model, an improvement over SASRec that deploys an increased number of negatives and the gBCE loss. We show through detailed experiments on three datasets that gSASRec does not exhibit the overconfidence problem. As a result, gSASRec can outperform BERT4Rec (e.g. +9.47% NDCG on the MovieLens-1M dataset), while requiring less training time (e.g. -73% training time on MovieLens-1M). Moreover, in contrast to BERT4Rec, gSASRec is suitable for large datasets that contain more than 1 million items.

**ABSTRACT**  
In the domain of streaming recommender systems, conventional methods for addressing new user IDs or item IDs typically involve assigning initial ID embeddings randomly. However, this practice results in two practical challenges: (i) Items or users with limited interactive data may yield suboptimal prediction performance. (ii) Embedding new IDs or low-frequency IDs necessitates consistently expanding the embedding table, leading to unnecessary memory consumption. In light of these concerns, we introduce a reinforcement learning-driven framework, namely AutoAssign+, that facilitates Automatic Shared Embedding Assignment Plus. To be specific, AutoAssign+ utilizes an Identity Agent as an actor network, which plays a dual role: (i) Representing low-frequency IDs field-wise with a small set of shared embeddings to enhance the embedding initialization, and (ii) Dynamically determining which ID features should be retained or eliminated in the embedding table. The policy of the agent is optimized with the guidance of a critic network. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we perform extensive experiments on three commonly used benchmark datasets. Our experiment results demonstrate that AutoAssign+ is capable of significantly enhancing recommendation performance by mitigating the cold-start problem. Furthermore, our framework yields a reduction in memory usage of approximately 20-30%, verifying its practical effectiveness and efficiency for streaming recommender systems.

**ABSTRACT**  
The evaluation of recommendation systems is a complex task. The offline and online evaluation metrics for recommender systems are ambiguous in their true objectives. The majority of recently published papers benchmark their methods using ill-posed offline evaluation methodology that often fails to predict true online performance. Because of this, the impact that academic research has on the industry is reduced. The aim of our research is to investigate and compare the online performance of offline evaluation metrics. We show that penalizing popular items and considering the time of transactions during the evaluation significantly improves our ability to choose the best recommendation model for a live recommender system. Our results, averaged over five large-size real-world live data procured from recommenders, aim to help the academic community to understand better offline evaluation and optimization criteria that are more relevant for real applications of recommender systems.

**ABSTRACT**  
Vision transformers are effective deep learning models for vision tasks, including medical image segmentation. However, they lack efficiency and translational invariance, unlike convolutional neural networks (CNNs). To model long-range interactions in 3D brain lesion segmentation, we propose an all-convolutional transformer block variant of the U-Net architecture. We demonstrate that our model provides the greatest compromise in three factors: performance competitive with the state-of-the-art; parameter efficiency of a CNN; and the favourable inductive biases of a transformer. Our public implementation is available at https://github.com/liamchalcroft/MDUNet .

**ABSTRACT**  
Brain tumors remain a critical global health challenge, necessitating advancements in diagnostic techniques and treatment methodologies. In response to the growing need for age-specific segmentation models, particularly for pediatric patients, this study explores the deployment of deep learning techniques using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) modalities. By introducing a novel ensemble approach using ONet and modified versions of UNet, coupled with innovative loss functions, this study achieves a precise segmentation model for the BraTS-PEDs 2023 Challenge. Data augmentation, including both single and composite transformations, ensures model robustness and accuracy across different scanning protocols. The ensemble strategy, integrating the ONet and UNet models, shows greater effectiveness in capturing specific features and modeling diverse aspects of the MRI images which result in lesion_wise dice scores of 0.52, 0.72 and 0.78 for enhancing tumor, tumor core and whole tumor labels respectively. Visual comparisons further confirm the superiority of the ensemble method in accurate tumor region coverage. The results indicate that this advanced ensemble approach, building upon the unique strengths of individual models, offers promising prospects for enhanced diagnostic accuracy and effective treatment planning for brain tumors in pediatric brains.

**ABSTRACT**  
The Segment Anything Model (SAM) serves as a fundamental model for semantic segmentation and demonstrates remarkable generalization capabilities across a wide range of downstream scenarios. In this empirical study, we examine SAM's robustness and zero-shot generalizability in the field of robotic surgery. We comprehensively explore different scenarios, including prompted and unprompted situations, bounding box and points-based prompt approaches, as well as the ability to generalize under corruptions and perturbations at five severity levels. Additionally, we compare the performance of SAM with state-of-the-art supervised models. We conduct all the experiments with two well-known robotic instrument segmentation datasets from MICCAI EndoVis 2017 and 2018 challenges. Our extensive evaluation results reveal that although SAM shows remarkable zero-shot generalization ability with bounding box prompts, it struggles to segment the whole instrument with point-based prompts and unprompted settings. Furthermore, our qualitative figures demonstrate that the model either failed to predict certain parts of the instrument mask (e.g., jaws, wrist) or predicted parts of the instrument as wrong classes in the scenario of overlapping instruments within the same bounding box or with the point-based prompt. In fact, SAM struggles to identify instruments in complex surgical scenarios characterized by the presence of blood, reflection, blur, and shade. Additionally, SAM is insufficiently robust to maintain high performance when subjected to various forms of data corruption. We also attempt to fine-tune SAM using Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA) and propose SurgicalSAM, which shows the capability in class-wise mask prediction without prompt. Therefore, we can argue that, without further domain-specific fine-tuning, SAM is not ready for downstream surgical tasks.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recent developments in deep learning (DL) techniques have led to great performance improvement in medical image segmentation tasks, especially with the latest Transformer model and its variants. While labels from fusing multi-rater manual segmentations are often employed as ideal ground truths in DL model training, inter-rater variability due to factors such as training bias, image noise, and extreme anatomical variability can still affect the performance and uncertainty of the resulting algorithms. Knowledge regarding how inter-rater variability affects the reliability of the resulting DL algorithms, a key element in clinical deployment, can help inform better training data construction and DL models, but has not been explored extensively. In this paper, we measure aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties using test-time augmentation (TTA), test-time dropout (TTD), and deep ensemble to explore their relationship with inter-rater variability. Furthermore, we compare UNet and TransUNet to study the impacts of Transformers on model uncertainty with two label fusion strategies. We conduct a case study using multi-class paraspinal muscle segmentation from T2w MRIs. Our study reveals the interplay between inter-rater variability and uncertainties, affected by choices of label fusion strategies and DL models.

**ABSTRACT**  
Automated segmentation of ultrasound images can assist medical experts with diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Although using the common modality of ultrasound, one typically needs separate datasets in order to segment, for example, different anatomical structures or lesions with different levels of malignancy. In this paper, we consider the problem of jointly learning from heterogeneous datasets so that the model can improve generalization abilities by leveraging the inherent variability among datasets. We merge the heterogeneous datasets into one dataset and refer to each component dataset as a subgroup. We propose to train a single segmentation model so that the model can adapt to each sub-group. For robust segmentation, we leverage recently proposed Segment Anything model (SAM) in order to incorporate sub-group information into the model. We propose SAM with Condition Embedding block (CEmb-SAM) which encodes sub-group conditions and combines them with image embeddings from SAM. The conditional embedding block effectively adapts SAM to each image sub-group by incorporating dataset properties through learnable parameters for normalization. Experiments show that CEmb-SAM outperforms the baseline methods on ultrasound image segmentation for peripheral nerves and breast cancer. The experiments highlight the effectiveness of Cemb-SAM in learning from heterogeneous datasets in medical image segmentation tasks.

**ABSTRACT**  
Deep neural networks have shown impressive performance for image-based disease detection. Performance is commonly evaluated through clinical validation on independent test sets to demonstrate clinically acceptable accuracy. Reporting good performance metrics on test sets, however, is not always a sufficient indication of the generalizability and robustness of an algorithm. In particular, when the test data is drawn from the same distribution as the training data, the iid test set performance can be an unreliable estimate of the accuracy on new data. In this paper, we employ stress testing to assess model robustness and subgroup performance disparities in disease detection models. We design progressive stress testing using five different bidirectional and unidirectional image perturbations with six different severity levels. As a use case, we apply stress tests to measure the robustness of disease detection models for chest X-ray and skin lesion images, and demonstrate the importance of studying class and domain-specific model behaviour. Our experiments indicate that some models may yield more robust and equitable performance than others. We also find that pretraining characteristics play an important role in downstream robustness. We conclude that progressive stress testing is a viable and important tool and should become standard practice in the clinical validation of image-based disease detection models.

**ABSTRACT**  
Remote operation is a crucial solution to problems encountered in agricultural machinery operations. However, traditional video streaming control methods fall short in overcoming the challenges of single perspective views and the inability to obtain 3D information. In light of these issues, our research proposes a large-scale digital map reconstruction and immersive human-machine remote control framework for agricultural scenarios. In our methodology, a DJI unmanned aerial vehicle(UAV) was utilized for data collection, and a novel video segmentation approach based on feature points was introduced. To tackle texture richness variability, an enhanced Structure from Motion (SfM) using superpixel segmentation was implemented. This method integrates the open Multiple View Geometry (openMVG) framework along with Local Features from Transformers (LoFTR). The enhanced SfM results in a point cloud map, which is further processed through Multi-View Stereo (MVS) to generate a complete map model. For control, a closed-loop system utilizing TCP for VR control and positioning of agricultural machinery was introduced. Our system offers a fully visual-based immersive control method, where upon connection to the local area network, operators can utilize VR for immersive remote control. The proposed method enhances both the robustness and convenience of the reconstruction process, thereby significantly facilitating operators in acquiring more comprehensive on-site information and engaging in immersive remote control operations.

**ABSTRACT**  
Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is widely used in different engineering fields, but accurate simulations are dependent upon proper meshing of the simulation domain. While highly refined meshes may ensure precision, they come with high computational costs. Similarly, adaptive remeshing techniques require multiple simulations and come at a great computational cost. This means that the meshing process is reliant upon expert knowledge and years of experience. Automating mesh generation can save significant time and effort and lead to a faster and more efficient design process. This paper presents a machine learning-based scheme that utilizes Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and expert guidance to automatically generate CFD meshes for aircraft models. In this work, we introduce a new 3D segmentation algorithm that outperforms two state-of-the-art models, PointNet++ and PointMLP, for surface classification. We also present a novel approach to project predictions from 3D mesh segmentation models to CAD surfaces using the conformal predictions method, which provides marginal statistical guarantees and robust uncertainty quantification and handling. We demonstrate that the addition of conformal predictions effectively enables the model to avoid under-refinement, hence failure, in CFD meshing even for weak and less accurate models. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through a real-world case study that demonstrates that our automatically generated mesh is comparable in quality to expert-generated meshes and enables the solver to converge and produce accurate results. Furthermore, we compare our approach to the alternative of adaptive remeshing in the same case study and find that our method is 5 times faster in the overall process of simulation.

**ABSTRACT**  
Although automatic emotion recognition (AER) has recently drawn significant research interest, most current AER studies use manually segmented utterances, which are usually unavailable for dialogue systems. This paper proposes integrating AER with automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speaker diarisation (SD) in a jointly-trained system. Distinct output layers are built for four sub-tasks including AER, ASR, voice activity detection and speaker classification based on a shared encoder. Taking the audio of a conversation as input, the integrated system finds all speech segments and transcribes the corresponding emotion classes, word sequences, and speaker identities. Two metrics are proposed to evaluate AER performance with automatic segmentation based on time-weighted emotion and speaker classification errors. Results on the IEMOCAP dataset show that the proposed system consistently outperforms two baselines with separately trained single-task systems on AER, ASR and SD.

However, existing models still face limitations in handling diverse audio-text speech generation tasks involving transforming input speech and processing audio captured in adverse acoustic conditions. This paper introduces SpeechX, a versatile speech generation model capable of zero-shot TTS and various speech transformation tasks, dealing with both clean and noisy signals. SpeechX combines neural codec language modeling with multi-task learning using task-dependent prompting, enabling unified and extensible modeling and providing a consistent way for leveraging textual input in speech enhancement and transformation tasks. Experimental results show SpeechX's efficacy in various tasks, including zero-shot TTS, noise suppression, target speaker extraction, speech removal, and speech editing with or without background noise, achieving comparable or superior performance to specialized models across tasks.

**ABSTRACT**  
Predicting which proteins interact together from amino-acid sequences is an important task. We develop a method to pair interacting protein sequences which leverages the power of protein language models trained on multiple sequence alignments, such as MSA Transformer and the EvoFormer module of AlphaFold. We formulate the problem of pairing interacting partners among the paralogs of two protein families in a differentiable way. We introduce a method called DiffPALM that solves it by exploiting the ability of MSA Transformer to fill in masked amino acids in multiple sequence alignments using the surrounding context. MSA Transformer encodes coevolution between functionally or structurally coupled amino acids. We show that it captures inter-chain coevolution, while it was trained on single-chain data, which means that it can be used out-of-distribution. Relying on MSA Transformer without fine-tuning, DiffPALM outperforms existing coevolution-based pairing methods on difficult benchmarks of shallow multiple sequence alignments extracted from ubiquitous prokaryotic protein datasets. It also outperforms an alternative method based on a state-of-the-art protein language model trained on single sequences. Paired alignments of interacting protein sequences are a crucial ingredient of supervised deep learning methods to predict the three-dimensional structure of protein complexes. DiffPALM substantially improves the structure prediction of some eukaryotic protein complexes by AlphaFold-Multimer, without significantly deteriorating any of those we tested. It also achieves competitive performance with using orthology-based pairing.

**ABSTRACT**  
LSM-trees are widely adopted as the storage backend of key-value stores. However, optimizing the system performance under dynamic workloads has not been sufficiently studied or evaluated in previous work. To fill the gap, we present RusKey, a key-value store with the following new features: (1) RusKey is a first attempt to orchestrate LSM-tree structures online to enable robust performance under the context of dynamic workloads; (2) RusKey is the first study to use Reinforcement Learning (RL) to guide LSM-tree transformations; (3) RusKey includes a new LSM-tree design, named FLSM-tree, for an efficient transition between different compaction policies -- the bottleneck of dynamic key-value stores. We justify the superiority of the new design with theoretical analysis; (4) RusKey requires no prior workload knowledge for system adjustment, in contrast to state-of-the-art techniques. Experiments show that RusKey exhibits strong performance robustness in diverse workloads, achieving up to 4x better end-to-end performance than the RocksDB system under various settings.

**ABSTRACT**  
Online academic profiles are used by scholars to reflect a desired image to their online audience. In Google Scholar, scholars can select a subset of co-authors for presentation in a central location on their profile using a social feature called the Co-authroship panel. In this work, we examine whether scientometrics and reciprocality can explain the observed selections. To this end, we scrape and thoroughly analyze a novel set of 120,000 Google Scholar profiles, ranging across four disciplines and various academic institutions. Our results suggest that scholars tend to favor co-authors with higher scientometrics over others for inclusion in their co-authorship panels. Interestingly, as one's own scientometrics are higher, the tendency to include co-authors with high scientometrics is diminishing. Furthermore, we find that reciprocality is central to explaining scholars' selections.

**ABSTRACT**  
Computing educators face significant challenges in providing timely support to students, especially in large class settings. Large language models (LLMs) have emerged recently and show great promise for providing on-demand help at a large scale, but there are concerns that students may over-rely on the outputs produced by these models. In this paper, we introduce CodeHelp, a novel LLM-powered tool designed with guardrails to provide on-demand assistance to programming students without directly revealing solutions. We detail the design of the tool, which incorporates a number of useful features for instructors, and elaborate on the pipeline of prompting strategies we use to ensure generated outputs are suitable for students. To evaluate CodeHelp, we deployed it in a first-year computer and data science course with 52 students and collected student interactions over a 12-week period. We examine students' usage patterns and perceptions of the tool, and we report reflections from the course instructor and a series of recommendations for classroom use. Our findings suggest that CodeHelp is well-received by students who especially value its availability and help with resolving errors, and that for instructors it is easy to deploy and complements, rather than replaces, the support that they provide to students.
