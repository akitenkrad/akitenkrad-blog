**ABSTRACT**  
This paper introduces a computing framework that combines Flow-Based Programming (FBP) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable Just-In-Time Programming (JITP). JITP empowers users, regardless of their programming expertise, to actively participate in the development and automation process by leveraging their task-time algorithmic insights. By seamlessly integrating LLMs into the FBP workflow, the framework allows users to request and generate code in real-time, enabling dynamic code execution within a flow-based program. The paper explores the motivations, principles, and benefits of JITP, showcasing its potential in automating tasks, orchestrating data workflows, and accelerating software development. Through a fully implemented JITP framework using the Composable platform, we explore several examples and use cases to illustrate the benefits of the framework in data engineering, data science and software development. The results demonstrate how the fusion of FBP and LLMs creates a powerful and user-centric computing paradigm.

**ABSTRACT**  
Rigorous testing of small Uncrewed Aerial Systems (sUAS) is crucial to ensure their safe and reliable deployment in the real world. sUAS developers aim to validate the reliability and safety of their applications through simulation testing. However, the dynamic nature of the real-world environment, including factors such as challenging weather conditions and wireless interference, causes unique software faults that may only be revealed through field testing. Considering the high cost and impracticality of conducting field testing in thousands of environmental contexts and conditions, there exists a pressing need to develop automated techniques that can generate high-fidelity, realistic environments enabling sUAS developers to deploy their applications and conduct thorough simulation testing in close-to-reality environmental conditions. To address this need, DroneReqValidator (DRV) offers a comprehensive small Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (sUAV) simulation ecosystem that automatically generates realistic environments based on developer-specified constraints, monitors sUAV activities against predefined safety parameters, and generates detailed acceptance test reports for effective debugging and analysis of sUAV applications. Providing these capabilities, DRV offers a valuable solution for enhancing the testing and development process of sUAS. The comprehensive demo of DRV is available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fd9ft55gbO8

**ABSTRACT**  
As a representative cyber-physical system (CPS), robotic manipulator has been widely adopted in various academic research and industrial processes, indicating its potential to act as a universal interface between the cyber and the physical worlds. Recent studies in robotics manipulation have started employing artificial intelligence (AI) approaches as controllers to achieve better adaptability and performance. However, the inherent challenge of explaining AI components introduces uncertainty and unreliability to these AI-enabled robotics systems, necessitating a reliable development platform for system design and performance assessment. As a foundational step towards building reliable AI-enabled robotics systems, we propose a public industrial benchmark for robotics manipulation in this paper. It leverages NVIDIA Omniverse Isaac Sim as the simulation platform, encompassing eight representative manipulation tasks and multiple AI software controllers. An extensive evaluation is conducted to analyze the performance of AI controllers in solving robotics manipulation tasks, enabling a thorough understanding of their effectiveness. To further demonstrate the applicability of our benchmark, we develop a falsification framework that is compatible with physical simulators and OpenAI Gym environments. This framework bridges the gap between traditional testing methods and modern physics engine-based simulations. The effectiveness of different optimization methods in falsifying AI-enabled robotics manipulation with physical simulators is examined via a falsification test. Our work not only establishes a foundation for the design and development of AI-enabled robotics systems but also provides practical experience and guidance to practitioners in this field, promoting further research in this critical academic and industrial domain.

**ABSTRACT**  
We present a novel approach - CLAA - for API aspect detection in API reviews that utilizes transformer models trained with a supervised contrastive loss objective function. We evaluate CLAA using performance and impact analysis. For performance analysis, we utilized a benchmark dataset on developer discussions collected from Stack Overflow and compare the results to those obtained using state-of-the-art transformer models. Our experiments show that contrastive learning can significantly improve the performance of transformer models in detecting aspects such as Performance, Security, Usability, and Documentation. For impact analysis, we performed empirical and developer study. On a randomly selected and manually labeled 200 online reviews, CLAA achieved 92% accuracy while the SOTA baseline achieved 81.5%. According to our developer study involving 10 participants, the use of 'Stack Overflow + CLAA' resulted in increased accuracy and confidence during API selection.

**ABSTRACT**  
The growth of systems complexity increases the need of automated techniques dedicated to different log analysis tasks such as Log-based Anomaly Detection (LAD). The latter has been widely addressed in the literature, mostly by means of different deep learning techniques. Nevertheless, the focus on deep learning techniques results in less attention being paid to traditional Machine Learning (ML) techniques, which may perform well in many cases, depending on the context and the used datasets. Further, the evaluation of different ML techniques is mostly based on the assessment of their detection accuracy. However, this is is not enough to decide whether or not a specific ML technique is suitable to address the LAD problem. Other aspects to consider include the training and prediction time as well as the sensitivity to hyperparameter tuning. In this paper, we present a comprehensive empirical study, in which we evaluate different supervised and semi-supervised, traditional and deep ML techniques w.r.t. four evaluation criteria: detection accuracy, time performance, sensitivity of detection accuracy as well as time performance to hyperparameter tuning. The experimental results show that supervised traditional and deep ML techniques perform very closely in terms of their detection accuracy and prediction time. Moreover, the overall evaluation of the sensitivity of the detection accuracy of the different ML techniques to hyperparameter tuning shows that supervised traditional ML techniques are less sensitive to hyperparameter tuning than deep learning techniques. Further, semi-supervised techniques yield significantly worse detection accuracy than supervised techniques.

**ABSTRACT**  
As a way of addressing increasingly sophisticated problems, software professionals face the constant challenge of seeking improvement. However, for these individuals to enhance their skills, their process of studying and training must involve feedback that is both immediate and accurate. In the context of software companies, where the scale of professionals undergoing training is large, but the number of qualified professionals available for providing corrections is small, delivering effective feedback becomes even more challenging. To circumvent this challenge, this work presents an exploration of using Large Language Models (LLMs) to support the correction process of open-ended questions in technical training. In this study, we utilized ChatGPT to correct open-ended questions answered by 42 industry professionals on two topics. Evaluating the corrections and feedback provided by ChatGPT, we observed that it is capable of identifying semantic details in responses that other metrics cannot observe. Furthermore, we noticed that, in general, subject matter experts tended to agree with the corrections and feedback given by ChatGPT.

**ABSTRACT**  
For most real-world applications, robots need to adapt and learn continually with limited data in their environments. In this paper, we consider the problem of Few-Shot class Incremental Learning (FSIL), in which an AI agent is required to learn incrementally from a few data samples without forgetting the data it has previously learned. To solve this problem, we present a novel framework inspired by theories of concept learning in the hippocampus and the neocortex. Our framework represents object classes in the form of sets of clusters and stores them in memory. The framework replays data generated by the clusters of the old classes, to avoid forgetting when learning new classes. Our approach is evaluated on two object classification datasets resulting in state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance for class-incremental learning and FSIL. We also evaluate our framework for FSIL on a robot demonstrating that the robot can continually learn to classify a large set of household objects with limited human assistance.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper employs an anomaly detection algorithm to assess the normal operation of underwater gliders in unpredictable ocean environments. Real-time alerts can be provided to glider pilots upon detecting any anomalies, enabling them to assume control of the glider and prevent further harm. The detection algorithm is applied to abundant data sets collected in real glider deployments led by the Skidaway Institute of Oceanography (SkIO) and the University of South Florida (USF). Regarding generality, the experimental evaluation is composed of both offline and online detection modes. The offline detection utilizes full post-recovery data sets, which carries high-resolution information, to present detailed analysis of the anomaly and compare it with pilot logs. The online detection focuses on the real-time subsets of data transmitted from the glider at the surfacing events. While the real-time data may not contain as much rich information as the post-recovery data, the online detection is of great importance as it allows glider pilots to monitor potential abnormal conditions in real time.

**ABSTRACT**  
Many objects such as tools and household items can be used only if grasped in a very specific way - grasped functionally. Often, a direct functional grasp is not possible, though. We propose a method for learning a dexterous pre-grasp manipulation policy to achieve human-like functional grasps using deep reinforcement learning. We introduce a dense multi-component reward function that enables learning a single policy, capable of dexterous pre-grasp manipulation of novel instances of several known object categories with an anthropomorphic hand. The policy is learned purely by means of reinforcement learning from scratch, without any expert demonstrations, and implicitly learns to reposition and reorient objects of complex shapes to achieve given functional grasps. Learning is done on a single GPU in less than three hours.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this work, we propose a learning based neural model that provides both the longitudinal and lateral control commands to simultaneously navigate multiple vehicles. The goal is to ensure that each vehicle reaches a desired target state without colliding with any other vehicle or obstacle in an unconstrained environment. The model utilizes an attention based Graphical Neural Network paradigm that takes into consideration the state of all the surrounding vehicles to make an informed decision. This allows each vehicle to smoothly reach its destination while also evading collision with the other agents. The data and corresponding labels for training such a network is obtained using an optimization based procedure. Experimental results demonstrates that our model is powerful enough to generalize even to situations with more vehicles than in the training data. Our method also outperforms comparable graphical neural network architectures.

**ABSTRACT**  
Legged locomotion is arguably the most suited and versatile mode to deal with natural or unstructured terrains. Intensive research into dynamic walking and running controllers has recently yielded great advances, both in the optimal control and reinforcement learning (RL) literature. Hopping is a challenging dynamic task involving a flight phase and has the potential to increase the traversability of legged robots. Model based control for hopping typically relies on accurate detection of different jump phases, such as lift-off or touch down, and using different controllers for each phase. In this paper, we present a end-to-end RL based torque controller that learns to implicitly detect the relevant jump phases, removing the need to provide manual heuristics for state detection. We also extend a method for simulation to reality transfer of the learned controller to contact rich dynamic tasks, resulting in successful deployment on the robot after training without parameter tuning.

**ABSTRACT**  
Vision Transformers (ViTs) have emerged as a promising approach for visual recognition tasks, revolutionizing the field by leveraging the power of transformer-based architectures. Among the various ViT models, Swin Transformers have gained considerable attention due to their hierarchical design and ability to capture both local and global visual features effectively. This paper evaluates the performance of Swin ViT model using gradient accumulation optimization (GAO) technique. We investigate the impact of gradient accumulation optimization technique on the model's accuracy and training time. Our experiments show that applying the GAO technique leads to a significant decrease in the accuracy of the Swin ViT model, compared to the standard Swin Transformer model. Moreover, we detect a significant increase in the training time of the Swin ViT model when GAO model is applied. These findings suggest that applying the GAO technique may not be suitable for the Swin ViT model, and concern should be undertaken when using GAO technique for other transformer-based models.

**ABSTRACT**  
Visual Geo-localization (VG) has emerged as a significant research area, aiming to identify geolocation based on visual features. Most VG approaches use learnable feature extractors for representation learning. Recently, Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods have also demonstrated comparable performance to supervised methods by using numerous unlabeled images for representation learning. In this work, we present a novel unified VG-SSL framework with the goal to enhance performance and training efficiency on a large VG dataset by SSL methods. Our work incorporates multiple SSL methods tailored for VG: SimCLR, MoCov2, BYOL, SimSiam, Barlow Twins, and VICReg. We systematically analyze the performance of different training strategies and study the optimal parameter settings for the adaptation of SSL methods for the VG task. The results demonstrate that our method, without the significant computation and memory usage associated with Hard Negative Mining (HNM), can match or even surpass the VG performance of the baseline that employs HNM. The code is available at https://github.com/arplaboratory/VG_SSL.

**ABSTRACT**  
Harnessing the power of pre-training on large-scale datasets like ImageNet forms a fundamental building block for the progress of representation learning-driven solutions in computer vision. Medical images are inherently different from natural images as they are acquired in the form of many modalities (CT, MR, PET, Ultrasound etc.) and contain granulated information like tissue, lesion, organs etc. These characteristics of medical images require special attention towards learning features representative of local context. In this work, we focus on designing an effective pre-training framework for 3D radiology images. First, we propose a new masking strategy called local masking where the masking is performed across channel embeddings instead of tokens to improve the learning of local feature representations. We combine this with classical low-level perturbations like adding noise and downsampling to further enable low-level representation learning. To this end, we introduce Disruptive Autoencoders, a pre-training framework that attempts to reconstruct the original image from disruptions created by a combination of local masking and low-level perturbations. Additionally, we also devise a cross-modal contrastive loss (CMCL) to accommodate the pre-training of multiple modalities in a single framework. We curate a large-scale dataset to enable pre-training of 3D medical radiology images (MRI and CT). The proposed pre-training framework is tested across multiple downstream tasks and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, our proposed method tops the public test leaderboard of BTCV multi-organ segmentation challenge.

**ABSTRACT**  
Self-supervised learning is a promising paradigm in deep learning that enables learning from unlabeled data by constructing pretext tasks that require learning useful representations. In natural language processing, the dominant pretext task has been masked language modeling (MLM), while in computer vision there exists an equivalent called Masked Image Modeling (MIM). However, MIM is challenging because it requires predicting semantic content in accurate locations. E.g, given an incomplete picture of a dog, we can guess that there is a tail, but we cannot determine its exact location. In this work, we propose FlexPredict, a stochastic model that addresses this challenge by incorporating location uncertainty into the model. Specifically, we condition the model on stochastic masked token positions to guide the model toward learning features that are more robust to location uncertainties. Our approach improves downstream performance on a range of tasks, e.g, compared to MIM baselines, FlexPredict boosts ImageNet linear probing by 1.6% with ViT-B and by 2.5% for semi-supervised video segmentation using ViT-L.

**ABSTRACT**  
With sufficient paired training samples, the supervised deep learning methods have attracted much attention in image denoising because of their superior performance. However, it is still very challenging to widely utilize the supervised methods in real cases due to the lack of paired noisy-clean images. Meanwhile, most self-supervised denoising methods are ineffective as well when applied to the real-world denoising tasks because of their strict assumptions in applications. For example, as a typical method for self-supervised denoising, the original blind spot network (BSN) assumes that the noise is pixel-wise independent, which is much different from the real cases. To solve this problem, we propose a novel self-supervised real image denoising framework named Sampling Difference As Perturbation (SDAP) based on Random Sub-samples Generation (RSG) with a cyclic sample difference loss. Specifically, we dig deeper into the properties of BSN to make it more suitable for real noise. Surprisingly, we find that adding an appropriate perturbation to the training images can effectively improve the performance of BSN. Further, we propose that the sampling difference can be considered as perturbation to achieve better results. Finally we propose a new BSN framework in combination with our RSG strategy. The results show that it significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art self-supervised denoising methods on real-world datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/p1y2z3/SDAP.

**ABSTRACT**  
Video Quality Assessment (VQA), which aims to predict the perceptual quality of a video, has attracted raising attention with the rapid development of streaming media technology, such as Facebook, TikTok, Kwai, and so on. Compared with other sequence-based visual tasks (\textit{e.g.,} action recognition), VQA faces two under-estimated challenges unresolved in User Generated Content (UGC) videos. \textit{First}, it is not rare that several frames containing serious distortions (\textit{e.g.,}blocking, blurriness), can determine the perceptual quality of the whole video, while other sequence-based tasks require more frames of equal importance for representations. \textit{Second}, the perceptual quality of a video exhibits a multi-distortion distribution, due to the differences in the duration and probability of occurrence for various distortions. In order to solve the above challenges, we propose \textit{Visual Quality Transformer (VQT)} to extract quality-related sparse features more efficiently. Methodologically, a Sparse Temporal Attention (STA) is proposed to sample keyframes by analyzing the temporal correlation between frames, which reduces the computational complexity from $O(T^2)$ to $O(T \log T)$. Structurally, a Multi-Pathway Temporal Network (MPTN) utilizes multiple STA modules with different degrees of sparsity in parallel, capturing co-existing distortions in a video. Experimentally, VQT demonstrates superior performance than many \textit{state-of-the-art} methods in three public no-reference VQA datasets. Furthermore, VQT shows better performance in four full-reference VQA datasets against widely-adopted industrial algorithms (\textit{i.e.,} VMAF and AVQT).

**ABSTRACT**  
In this study, the structural problems of the YOLOv5 model were analyzed emphatically. Based on the characteristics of fine defects in artificial leather, four innovative structures, namely DFP, IFF, AMP, and EOS, were designed. These advancements led to the proposal of a high-performance artificial leather fine defect detection model named YOLOD. YOLOD demonstrated outstanding performance on the artificial leather defect dataset, achieving an impressive increase of 11.7% - 13.5% in AP_50 compared to YOLOv5, along with a significant reduction of 5.2% - 7.2% in the error detection rate. Moreover, YOLOD also exhibited remarkable performance on the general MS-COCO dataset, with an increase of 0.4% - 2.6% in AP compared to YOLOv5, and a rise of 2.5% - 4.1% in AP_S compared to YOLOv5. These results demonstrate the superiority of YOLOD in both artificial leather defect detection and general object detection tasks, making it a highly efficient and effective model for real-world applications.

**ABSTRACT**  
Multi-spectral image stitching leverages the complementarity between infrared and visible images to generate a robust and reliable wide field-of-view (FOV) scene. The primary challenge of this task is to explore the relations between multi-spectral images for aligning and integrating multi-view scenes. Capitalizing on the strengths of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) in modeling feature relationships, we propose a spatial graph reasoning based multi-spectral image stitching method that effectively distills the deformation and integration of multi-spectral images across different viewpoints. To accomplish this, we embed multi-scale complementary features from the same view position into a set of nodes. The correspondence across different views is learned through powerful dense feature embeddings, where both inter- and intra-correlations are developed to exploit cross-view matching and enhance inner feature disparity. By introducing long-range coherence along spatial and channel dimensions, the complementarity of pixel relations and channel interdependencies aids in the reconstruction of aligned multi-view features, generating informative and reliable wide FOV scenes. Moreover, we release a challenging dataset named ChaMS, comprising both real-world and synthetic sets with significant parallax, providing a new option for comprehensive evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses the state-of-the-arts.

**ABSTRACT**  
Image captioning is conventionally formulated as the task of generating captions for images that match the distribution of reference image-caption pairs. However, reference captions in standard captioning datasets are short and may not uniquely identify the images they describe. These problems are further exacerbated when models are trained directly on image-alt text pairs collected from the internet. In this work, we show that it is possible to generate more specific captions with minimal changes to the training process. We implement classifier-free guidance for an autoregressive captioning model by fine-tuning it to estimate both conditional and unconditional distributions over captions. The guidance scale applied at decoding controls a trade-off between maximizing $p(\mathrm{caption}|\mathrm{image})$ and $p(\mathrm{image}|\mathrm{caption})$. Compared to standard greedy decoding, decoding with a guidance scale of 2 substantially improves reference-free metrics such as CLIPScore (0.808 vs. 0.775) and caption$\to$image retrieval performance in the CLIP embedding space (recall@1 44.6% vs. 26.5%), but worsens standard reference-based captioning metrics (e.g., CIDEr 78.6 vs 126.1). We further explore the use of language models to guide the decoding process, obtaining small improvements over the Pareto frontier of reference-free vs. reference-based captioning metrics that arises from classifier-free guidance, and substantially improving the quality of captions generated from a model trained only on minimally curated web data.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper presents a CLIP-based unsupervised learning method for annotation-free multi-label image classification, including three stages: initialization, training, and inference. At the initialization stage, we take full advantage of the powerful CLIP model and propose a novel approach to extend CLIP for multi-label predictions based on global-local image-text similarity aggregation. To be more specific, we split each image into snippets and leverage CLIP to generate the similarity vector for the whole image (global) as well as each snippet (local). Then a similarity aggregator is introduced to leverage the global and local similarity vectors. Using the aggregated similarity scores as the initial pseudo labels at the training stage, we propose an optimization framework to train the parameters of the classification network and refine pseudo labels for unobserved labels. During inference, only the classification network is used to predict the labels of the input image. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods on MS-COCO, PASCAL VOC 2007, PASCAL VOC 2012, and NUS datasets and even achieves comparable results to weakly supervised classification methods.

**ABSTRACT**  
Data-Free Knowledge Distillation (DFKD) is a novel task that aims to train high-performance student models using only the teacher network without original training data. Despite encouraging results, existing DFKD methods rely heavily on generation modules with high computational costs. Meanwhile, they ignore the fact that the generated and original data exist domain shifts due to the lack of supervision information. Moreover, knowledge is transferred through each example, ignoring the implicit relationship among multiple examples. To this end, we propose a novel Open-world Data Sampling Distillation (ODSD) method without a redundant generation process. First, we try to sample open-world data close to the original data's distribution by an adaptive sampling module. Then, we introduce a low-noise representation to alleviate the domain shifts and build a structured relationship of multiple data examples to exploit data knowledge. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, NYUv2, and ImageNet show that our ODSD method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Especially, we improve 1.50\%-9.59\% accuracy on the ImageNet dataset compared with the existing results.

**ABSTRACT**  
Optical flow estimation aims to find the 2D dense motion field between two frames. Due to the limitation of model structures and training datasets, existing methods often rely too much on local clues and ignore the integrity of objects, resulting in fragmented motion estimation. We notice that the recently famous Segment Anything Model (SAM) demonstrates a strong ability to segment complete objects, which is suitable for solving the fragmentation problem in optical flow estimation. We thus propose a solution to embed the frozen SAM image encoder into FlowFormer to enhance object perception. To address the challenge of in-depth utilizing SAM in non-segmentation tasks like optical flow estimation, we propose an Optical Flow Task-Specific Adaption scheme, including a Context Fusion Module to fuse the SAM encoder with the optical flow context encoder, and a Context Adaption Module to adapt the SAM features for optical flow task with Learned Task-Specific Embedding. Our proposed SAMFlow model reaches 0.86/2.10 clean/final EPE and 3.55/12.32 EPE/F1-all on Sintel and KITTI-15 training set, surpassing Flowformer by 8.5%/9.9% and 13.2%/16.3%. Furthermore, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Sintel and KITTI-15 benchmarks, ranking #1 among all two-frame methods on Sintel clean pass.

**ABSTRACT**  
We propose a latent diffusion model with contrastive learning for audio-visual segmentation (AVS) to extensively explore the contribution of audio. We interpret AVS as a conditional generation task, where audio is defined as the conditional variable for sound producer(s) segmentation. With our new interpretation, it is especially necessary to model the correlation between audio and the final segmentation map to ensure its contribution. We introduce a latent diffusion model to our framework to achieve semantic-correlated representation learning. Specifically, our diffusion model learns the conditional generation process of the ground-truth segmentation map, leading to ground-truth aware inference when we perform the denoising process at the test stage. As a conditional diffusion model, we argue it is essential to ensure that the conditional variable contributes to model output. We then introduce contrastive learning to our framework to learn audio-visual correspondence, which is proven consistent with maximizing the mutual information between model prediction and the audio data. In this way, our latent diffusion model via contrastive learning explicitly maximizes the contribution of audio for AVS. Experimental results on the benchmark dataset verify the effectiveness of our solution. Code and results are online via our project page: https://github.com/OpenNLPLab/DiffusionAVS.

**ABSTRACT**  
Semantic segmentation models are known vulnerable to small input perturbations. In this paper, we comprehensively analysis the performance of semantic segmentation models \wrt~adversarial attacks, and observe that the adversarial examples generated from a source model fail to attack the target models, \ie~the conventional attack methods, such as PGD and FGSM, do not transfer well to target models, making it necessary to study the transferable attacks, especially transferable attacks for semantic segmentation. We find that to achieve transferable attack, the attack should come with effective data augmentation and translation-invariant features to deal with unseen models, and stabilized optimization strategies to find the optimal attack direction. Based on the above observations, we propose an ensemble attack for semantic segmentation by aggregating several transferable attacks from classification to achieve more effective attacks with higher transferability. The source code and experimental results are publicly available via our project page: https://github.com/anucvers/TASS.

**ABSTRACT**  
Video portrait segmentation (VPS), aiming at segmenting prominent foreground portraits from video frames, has received much attention in recent years. However, simplicity of existing VPS datasets leads to a limitation on extensive research of the task. In this work, we propose a new intricate large-scale Multi-scene Video Portrait Segmentation dataset MVPS consisting of 101 video clips in 7 scenario categories, in which 10,843 sampled frames are finely annotated at pixel level. The dataset has diverse scenes and complicated background environments, which is the most complex dataset in VPS to our best knowledge. Through the observation of a large number of videos with portraits during dataset construction, we find that due to the joint structure of human body, motion of portraits is part-associated, which leads that different parts are relatively independent in motion. That is, motion of different parts of the portraits is unbalanced. Towards this unbalance, an intuitive and reasonable idea is that different motion states in portraits can be better exploited by decoupling the portraits into parts. To achieve this, we propose a Part-Decoupling Network (PDNet) for video portrait segmentation. Specifically, an Inter-frame Part-Discriminated Attention (IPDA) module is proposed which unsupervisely segments portrait into parts and utilizes different attentiveness on discriminative features specified to each different part. In this way, appropriate attention can be imposed to portrait parts with unbalanced motion to extract part-discriminated correlations, so that the portraits can be segmented more accurately. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves leading performance with the comparison to state-of-the-art methods.

**ABSTRACT**  
The video frame interpolation (VFI) model applies the convolution operation to all locations, leading to redundant computations in regions with easy motion. We can use dynamic spatial pruning method to skip redundant computation, but this method cannot properly identify easy regions in VFI tasks without supervision. In this paper, we develop an Uncertainty-Guided Spatial Pruning (UGSP) architecture to skip redundant computation for efficient frame interpolation dynamically. Specifically, pixels with low uncertainty indicate easy regions, where the calculation can be reduced without bringing undesirable visual results. Therefore, we utilize uncertainty-generated mask labels to guide our UGSP in properly locating the easy region. Furthermore, we propose a self-contrast training strategy that leverages an auxiliary non-pruning branch to improve the performance of our UGSP. Extensive experiments show that UGSP maintains performance but reduces FLOPs by 34%/52%/30% compared to baseline without pruning on Vimeo90K/UCF101/MiddleBury datasets. In addition, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with lower FLOPs on multiple benchmarks.

**ABSTRACT**  
Image-to-text generation aims to describe images using natural language. Recently, zero-shot image captioning based on pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) and large language models (LLMs) has made significant progress. However, we have observed and empirically demonstrated that these methods are susceptible to modality bias induced by LLMs and tend to generate descriptions containing objects (entities) that do not actually exist in the image but frequently appear during training (i.e., object hallucination). In this paper, we propose ViECap, a transferable decoding model that leverages entity-aware decoding to generate descriptions in both seen and unseen scenarios. ViECap incorporates entity-aware hard prompts to guide LLMs' attention toward the visual entities present in the image, enabling coherent caption generation across diverse scenes. With entity-aware hard prompts, ViECap is capable of maintaining performance when transferring from in-domain to out-of-domain scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViECap sets a new state-of-the-art cross-domain (transferable) captioning and performs competitively in-domain captioning compared to previous VLMs-based zero-shot methods.

**ABSTRACT**  
The rise in popularity of text-to-image generative artificial intelligence (AI) has attracted widespread public interest. At the same time, backdoor attacks are well-known in machine learning literature for their effective manipulation of neural models, which is a growing concern among practitioners. We highlight this threat for generative AI by introducing a Backdoor Attack on text-to-image Generative Models (BAGM). Our attack targets various stages of the text-to-image generative pipeline, modifying the behaviour of the embedded tokenizer and the pre-trained language and visual neural networks. Based on the penetration level, BAGM takes the form of a suite of attacks that are referred to as surface, shallow and deep attacks in this article. We compare the performance of BAGM to recently emerging related methods. We also contribute a set of quantitative metrics for assessing the performance of backdoor attacks on generative AI models in the future. The efficacy of the proposed framework is established by targeting the state-of-the-art stable diffusion pipeline in a digital marketing scenario as the target domain. To that end, we also contribute a Marketable Foods dataset of branded product images. We hope this work contributes towards exposing the contemporary generative AI security challenges and fosters discussions on preemptive efforts for addressing those challenges.

Recently, integrating video foundation models and large language models to build a video understanding system overcoming the limitations of specific pre-defined vision tasks. Yet, existing systems can only handle videos with very few frames. For long videos, the computation complexity, memory cost, and long-term temporal connection are the remaining challenges. Inspired by Atkinson-Shiffrin memory model, we develop an memory mechanism including a rapidly updated short-term memory and a compact thus sustained long-term memory. We employ tokens in Transformers as the carriers of memory. MovieChat achieves state-of-the-art performace in long video understanding.

**ABSTRACT**  
RAW files are the initial measurement of scene radiance widely used in most cameras, and the ubiquitously-used RGB images are converted from RAW data through Image Signal Processing (ISP) pipelines. Nowadays, digital images are risky of being nefariously manipulated. Inspired by the fact that innate immunity is the first line of body defense, we propose DRAW, a novel scheme of defending images against manipulation by protecting their sources, i.e., camera-shooted RAWs. Specifically, we design a lightweight Multi-frequency Partial Fusion Network (MPF-Net) friendly to devices with limited computing resources by frequency learning and partial feature fusion. It introduces invisible watermarks as protective signal into the RAW data. The protection capability can not only be transferred into the rendered RGB images regardless of the applied ISP pipeline, but also is resilient to post-processing operations such as blurring or compression. Once the image is manipulated, we can accurately identify the forged areas with a localization network. Extensive experiments on several famous RAW datasets, e.g., RAISE, FiveK and SIDD, indicate the effectiveness of our method. We hope that this technique can be used in future cameras as an option for image protection, which could effectively restrict image manipulation at the source.

**ABSTRACT**  
Deep learning has achieved remarkable results in fingerprint embedding, which plays a critical role in modern Automated Fingerprint Identification Systems. However, previous works including CNN-based and Transformer-based approaches fail to exploit the nonstructural data, such as topology and correlation in fingerprints, which is essential to facilitate the identifiability and robustness of embedding. To address this challenge, we propose a novel paradigm for fingerprint embedding, called Minutiae Relation-Aware model over Graph Neural Network (MRA-GNN). Our proposed approach incorporates a GNN-based framework in fingerprint embedding to encode the topology and correlation of fingerprints into descriptive features, achieving fingerprint representation in the form of graph embedding. Specifically, we reinterpret fingerprint data and their relative connections as vertices and edges respectively, and introduce a minutia graph and fingerprint graph to represent the topological relations and correlation structures of fingerprints. We equip MRA-GNN with a Topological relation Reasoning Module (TRM) and Correlation-Aware Module (CAM) to learn the fingerprint embedding from these graphs successfully. To tackle the over-smoothing problem in GNN models, we incorporate Feed-Forward Module and graph residual connections into proposed modules. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on various fingerprint datasets, indicating the effectiveness of our approach in exploiting nonstructural information of fingerprints.

**ABSTRACT**  
In recent times there has been a surge of multi-modal architectures based on Large Language Models, which leverage the zero shot generation capabilities of LLMs and project image embeddings into the text space and then use the auto-regressive capacity to solve tasks such as VQA, captioning, and image retrieval. We name these architectures as "bridge-architectures" as they project from the image space to the text space. These models deviate from the traditional recipe of training transformer based multi-modal models, which involve using large-scale pre-training and complex multi-modal interactions through co or cross attention. However, the capabilities of bridge architectures have not been tested on complex visual reasoning tasks which require fine grained analysis about the image. In this project, we investigate the performance of these bridge-architectures on the NLVR2 dataset, and compare it to state-of-the-art transformer based architectures. We first extend the traditional bridge architectures for the NLVR2 dataset, by adding object level features to faciliate fine-grained object reasoning. Our analysis shows that adding object level features to bridge architectures does not help, and that pre-training on multi-modal data is key for good performance on complex reasoning tasks such as NLVR2. We also demonstrate some initial results on a recently bridge-architecture, LLaVA, in the zero shot setting and analyze its performance.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this study, we focus on the problem of 3D human mesh recovery from a single image under obscured conditions. Most state-of-the-art methods aim to improve 2D alignment technologies, such as spatial averaging and 2D joint sampling. However, they tend to neglect the crucial aspect of 3D alignment by improving 3D representations. Furthermore, recent methods struggle to separate the target human from occlusion or background in crowded scenes as they optimize the 3D space of target human with 3D joint coordinates as local supervision. To address these issues, a desirable method would involve a framework for fusing 2D and 3D features and a strategy for optimizing the 3D space globally. Therefore, this paper presents 3D JOint contrastive learning with TRansformers (JOTR) framework for handling occluded 3D human mesh recovery. Our method includes an encoder-decoder transformer architecture to fuse 2D and 3D representations for achieving 2D$\&$3D aligned results in a coarse-to-fine manner and a novel 3D joint contrastive learning approach for adding explicitly global supervision for the 3D feature space. The contrastive learning approach includes two contrastive losses: joint-to-joint contrast for enhancing the similarity of semantically similar voxels (i.e., human joints), and joint-to-non-joint contrast for ensuring discrimination from others (e.g., occlusions and background). Qualitative and quantitative analyses demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art competitors on both occlusion-specific and standard benchmarks, significantly improving the reconstruction of occluded humans.

**ABSTRACT**  
Videos for mobile devices become the most popular access to share and acquire information recently. For the convenience of users' creation, in this paper, we present a system, namely MobileVidFactory, to automatically generate vertical mobile videos where users only need to give simple texts mainly. Our system consists of two parts: basic and customized generation. In the basic generation, we take advantage of the pretrained image diffusion model, and adapt it to a high-quality open-domain vertical video generator for mobile devices. As for the audio, by retrieving from our big database, our system matches a suitable background sound for the video. Additionally to produce customized content, our system allows users to add specified screen texts to the video for enriching visual expression, and specify texts for automatic reading with optional voices as they like.

**ABSTRACT**  
Can we better anticipate an actor's future actions (e.g. mix eggs) by knowing what commonly happens after his/her current action (e.g. crack eggs)? What if we also know the longer-term goal of the actor (e.g. making egg fried rice)? The long-term action anticipation (LTA) task aims to predict an actor's future behavior from video observations in the form of verb and noun sequences, and it is crucial for human-machine interaction. We propose to formulate the LTA task from two perspectives: a bottom-up approach that predicts the next actions autoregressively by modeling temporal dynamics; and a top-down approach that infers the goal of the actor and plans the needed procedure to accomplish the goal. We hypothesize that large language models (LLMs), which have been pretrained on procedure text data (e.g. recipes, how-tos), have the potential to help LTA from both perspectives. It can help provide the prior knowledge on the possible next actions, and infer the goal given the observed part of a procedure, respectively. To leverage the LLMs, we propose a two-stage framework, AntGPT. It first recognizes the actions already performed in the observed videos and then asks an LLM to predict the future actions via conditioned generation, or to infer the goal and plan the whole procedure by chain-of-thought prompting. Empirical results on the Ego4D LTA v1 and v2 benchmarks, EPIC-Kitchens-55, as well as EGTEA GAZE+ demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach. AntGPT achieves state-of-the-art performance on all above benchmarks, and can successfully infer the goal and thus perform goal-conditioned "counterfactual" prediction via qualitative analysis. Code and model will be released at https://brown-palm.github.io/AntGPT

**ABSTRACT**  
Coaxing out desired behavior from pretrained models, while avoiding undesirable ones, has redefined NLP and is reshaping how we interact with computers. What was once a scientific engineering discipline-in which building blocks are stacked one on top of the other-is arguably already a complex systems science, in which emergent behaviors are sought out to support previously unimagined use cases.   Despite the ever increasing number of benchmarks that measure task performance, we lack explanations of what behaviors language models exhibit that allow them to complete these tasks in the first place. We argue for a systematic effort to decompose language model behavior into categories that explain cross-task performance, to guide mechanistic explanations and help future-proof analytic research.

**ABSTRACT**  
Node classification is one of the core tasks on attributed graphs, but successful graph learning solutions require sufficiently labeled data. To keep annotation costs low, active graph learning focuses on selecting the most qualitative subset of nodes that maximizes label efficiency. However, deciding which heuristic is best suited for an unlabeled graph to increase label efficiency is a persistent challenge. Existing solutions either neglect aligning the learned model and the sampling method or focus only on limited selection aspects. They are thus sometimes worse or only equally good as random sampling. In this work, we introduce a novel active graph learning approach called DiffusAL, showing significant robustness in diverse settings. Toward better transferability between different graph structures, we combine three independent scoring functions to identify the most informative node samples for labeling in a parameter-free way: i) Model Uncertainty, ii) Diversity Component, and iii) Node Importance computed via graph diffusion heuristics. Most of our calculations for acquisition and training can be pre-processed, making DiffusAL more efficient compared to approaches combining diverse selection criteria and similarly fast as simpler heuristics. Our experiments on various benchmark datasets show that, unlike previous methods, our approach significantly outperforms random selection in 100% of all datasets and labeling budgets tested.

**ABSTRACT**  
Motivated by the need to address the degeneracy of canonical Laplace learning algorithms in low label rates, we propose to reformulate graph-based semi-supervised learning as a nonconvex generalization of a \emph{Trust-Region Subproblem} (TRS). This reformulation is motivated by the well-posedness of Laplacian eigenvectors in the limit of infinite unlabeled data. To solve this problem, we first show that a first-order condition implies the solution of a manifold alignment problem and that solutions to the classical \emph{Orthogonal Procrustes} problem can be used to efficiently find good classifiers that are amenable to further refinement. Next, we address the criticality of selecting supervised samples at low-label rates. We characterize informative samples with a novel measure of centrality derived from the principal eigenvectors of a certain submatrix of the graph Laplacian. We demonstrate that our framework achieves lower classification error compared to recent state-of-the-art and classical semi-supervised learning methods at extremely low, medium, and high label rates. Our code is available on github\footnote{anonymized for submission}.

**ABSTRACT**  
Anomaly detection and its explanation is important in many research areas such as intrusion detection, fraud detection, unknown attack detection in network traffic and logs. It is challenging to identify the cause or explanation of why one instance is an anomaly? and the other is not due to its unbounded and lack of supervisory nature. The answer to this question is possible with the emerging technique of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). XAI provides tools and techniques to interpret and explain the output and working of complex models such as Deep Learning (DL). This paper aims to detect and explain network anomalies with XAI, kernelSHAP method. The same approach is used to improve the network anomaly detection model in terms of accuracy, recall, precision and f score. The experiment is conduced with the latest CICIDS2017 dataset. Two models are created (Model_1 and OPT_Model) and compared. The overall accuracy and F score of OPT_Model (when trained in unsupervised way) are 0.90 and 0.76, respectively.

**ABSTRACT**  
Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the most exciting developments in Computer Science of the last decade. At the same time, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a very successful paradigm for a variety of machine learning tasks. In this survey, we discuss the state of the art, opportunities and open research questions in applying RL to generative AI. In particular, we will discuss three types of applications, namely, RL as an alternative way for generation without specified objectives; as a way for generating outputs while concurrently maximizing an objective function; and, finally, as a way of embedding desired characteristics, which cannot be easily captured by means of an objective function, into the generative process. We conclude the survey with an in-depth discussion of the opportunities and challenges in this fascinating emerging area.

**ABSTRACT**  
We study the problem of uncertainty quantification for time series prediction, with the goal of providing easy-to-use algorithms with formal guarantees. The algorithms we present build upon ideas from conformal prediction and control theory, are able to prospectively model conformal scores in an online setting, and adapt to the presence of systematic errors due to seasonality, trends, and general distribution shifts. Our theory both simplifies and strengthens existing analyses in online conformal prediction. Experiments on 4-week-ahead forecasting of statewide COVID-19 death counts in the U.S. show an improvement in coverage over the ensemble forecaster used in official CDC communications. We also run experiments on predicting electricity demand, market returns, and temperature using autoregressive, Theta, Prophet, and Transformer models. We provide an extendable codebase for testing our methods and for the integration of new algorithms, data sets, and forecasting rules.

**ABSTRACT**  
Encrypted traffic classification is receiving widespread attention from researchers and industrial companies. However, the existing methods only extract flow-level features, failing to handle short flows because of unreliable statistical properties, or treat the header and payload equally, failing to mine the potential correlation between bytes. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a byte-level traffic graph construction approach based on point-wise mutual information (PMI), and a model named Temporal Fusion Encoder using Graph Neural Networks (TFE-GNN) for feature extraction. In particular, we design a dual embedding layer, a GNN-based traffic graph encoder as well as a cross-gated feature fusion mechanism, which can first embed the header and payload bytes separately and then fuses them together to obtain a stronger feature representation. The experimental results on two real datasets demonstrate that TFE-GNN outperforms multiple state-of-the-art methods in fine-grained encrypted traffic classification tasks.

**ABSTRACT**  
The use of graph neural networks has produced significant advances in point cloud problems, such as those found in high energy physics. The question of how to produce a graph structure in these problems is usually treated as a matter of heuristics, employing fully connected graphs or K-nearest neighbors. In this work, we elevate this question to utmost importance as the Topology Problem. We propose an attention mechanism that allows a graph to be constructed in a learned space that handles geometrically the flow of relevance, providing one solution to the Topology Problem. We test this architecture, called GravNetNorm, on the task of top jet tagging, and show that it is competitive in tagging accuracy, and uses far fewer computational resources than all other comparable models.

**ABSTRACT**  
Deep learning models have shown great promise in various healthcare monitoring applications. However, most healthcare datasets with high-quality (gold-standard) labels are small-scale, as directly collecting ground truth is often costly and time-consuming. As a result, models developed and validated on small-scale datasets often suffer from overfitting and do not generalize well to unseen scenarios. At the same time, large amounts of imprecise (silver-standard) labeled data, annotated by approximate methods with the help of modern wearables and in the absence of ground truth validation, are starting to emerge. However, due to measurement differences, this data displays significant label distribution shifts, which motivates the use of domain adaptation. To this end, we introduce UDAMA, a method with two key components: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation and Multidiscriminator Adversarial Training, where we pre-train on the silver-standard data and employ adversarial adaptation with the gold-standard data along with two domain discriminators. In particular, we showcase the practical potential of UDAMA by applying it to Cardio-respiratory fitness (CRF) prediction. CRF is a crucial determinant of metabolic disease and mortality, and it presents labels with various levels of noise (goldand silver-standard), making it challenging to establish an accurate prediction model. Our results show promising performance by alleviating distribution shifts in various label shift settings. Additionally, by using data from two free-living cohort studies (Fenland and BBVS), we show that UDAMA consistently outperforms up to 12% compared to competitive transfer learning and state-of-the-art domain adaptation models, paving the way for leveraging noisy labeled data to improve fitness estimation at scale.

**ABSTRACT**  
As machine learning methods gain prominence within clinical decision-making, addressing fairness concerns becomes increasingly urgent. Despite considerable work dedicated to detecting and ameliorating algorithmic bias, today's methods are deficient with potentially harmful consequences. Our causal perspective sheds new light on algorithmic bias, highlighting how different sources of dataset bias may appear indistinguishable yet require substantially different mitigation strategies. We introduce three families of causal bias mechanisms stemming from disparities in prevalence, presentation, and annotation. Our causal analysis underscores how current mitigation methods tackle only a narrow and often unrealistic subset of scenarios. We provide a practical three-step framework for reasoning about fairness in medical imaging, supporting the development of safe and equitable AI prediction models.

**ABSTRACT**  
Equipping a deep model the abaility of few-shot learning, i.e., learning quickly from only few examples, is a core challenge for artificial intelligence. Gradient-based meta-learning approaches effectively address the challenge by learning how to learn novel tasks. Its key idea is learning a deep model in a bi-level optimization manner, where the outer-loop process learns a shared gradient descent algorithm (i.e., its hyperparameters), while the inner-loop process leverage it to optimize a task-specific model by using only few labeled data. Although these existing methods have shown superior performance, the outer-loop process requires calculating second-order derivatives along the inner optimization path, which imposes considerable memory burdens and the risk of vanishing gradients. Drawing inspiration from recent progress of diffusion models, we find that the inner-loop gradient descent process can be actually viewed as a reverse process (i.e., denoising) of diffusion where the target of denoising is model weights but the origin data. Based on this fact, in this paper, we propose to model the gradient descent optimizer as a diffusion model and then present a novel task-conditional diffusion-based meta-learning, called MetaDiff, that effectively models the optimization process of model weights from Gaussion noises to target weights in a denoising manner. Thanks to the training efficiency of diffusion models, our MetaDiff do not need to differentiate through the inner-loop path such that the memory burdens and the risk of vanishing gradients can be effectvely alleviated. Experiment results show that our MetaDiff outperforms the state-of-the-art gradient-based meta-learning family in few-shot learning tasks.

**ABSTRACT**  
Machine learning practitioners often fine-tune generative pre-trained models like GPT-3 to improve model performance at specific tasks. Previous works, however, suggest that fine-tuned machine learning models memorize and emit sensitive information from the original fine-tuning dataset. Companies such as OpenAI offer fine-tuning services for their models, but no prior work has conducted a memorization attack on any closed-source models. In this work, we simulate a privacy attack on GPT-3 using OpenAI's fine-tuning API. Our objective is to determine if personally identifiable information (PII) can be extracted from this model. We (1) explore the use of naive prompting methods on a GPT-3 fine-tuned classification model, and (2) we design a practical word generation task called Autocomplete to investigate the extent of PII memorization in fine-tuned GPT-3 within a real-world context. Our findings reveal that fine-tuning GPT3 for both tasks led to the model memorizing and disclosing critical personally identifiable information (PII) obtained from the underlying fine-tuning dataset.

**ABSTRACT**  
Deep learning models have demonstrated impressive performance in various domains. However, the prolonged training time of these models remains a critical problem. Manually designed parallel training strategies could enhance efficiency but require considerable time and deliver little flexibility. Hence, automatic parallelism is proposed to automate the parallel strategy searching process. Even so, existing approaches suffer from sub-optimal strategy space because they treat automatic parallelism as two independent stages, namely inter- and intra-layer parallelism. To address this issue, we propose UniAP, which utilizes mixed integer quadratic programming to unify inter- and intra-layer automatic parallelism. To the best of our knowledge, UniAP is the first work to unify these two categories to search for a globally optimal strategy. The experimental results show that UniAP outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 1.70$\times$ in throughput and reduces strategy searching time by up to 16$\times$ across four Transformer-like models.

**ABSTRACT**  
Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in the field of bearing fault diagnosis. However, this success comes with larger models and more complex computations, which cannot be transferred into industrial fields requiring models to be of high speed, strong portability, and low power consumption. In this paper, we propose a lightweight and deployable model for bearing fault diagnosis, referred to as BearingPGA-Net, to address these challenges. Firstly, aided by a well-trained large model, we train BearingPGA-Net via decoupled knowledge distillation. Despite its small size, our model demonstrates excellent fault diagnosis performance compared to other lightweight state-of-the-art methods. Secondly, we design an FPGA acceleration scheme for BearingPGA-Net using Verilog. This scheme involves the customized quantization and designing programmable logic gates for each layer of BearingPGA-Net on the FPGA, with an emphasis on parallel computing and module reuse to enhance the computational speed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first instance of deploying a CNN-based bearing fault diagnosis model on an FPGA. Experimental results reveal that our deployment scheme achieves over 200 times faster diagnosis speed compared to CPU, while achieving a lower-than-0.4\% performance drop in terms of F1, Recall, and Precision score on our independently-collected bearing dataset. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/asdvfghg/BearingPGA-Net}.

**ABSTRACT**  
Conformal prediction (CP) is a framework to quantify uncertainty of machine learning classifiers including deep neural networks. Given a testing example and a trained classifier, CP produces a prediction set of candidate labels with a user-specified coverage (i.e., true class label is contained with high probability). Almost all the existing work on CP assumes clean testing data and there is not much known about the robustness of CP algorithms w.r.t natural/adversarial perturbations to testing examples. This paper studies the problem of probabilistically robust conformal prediction (PRCP) which ensures robustness to most perturbations around clean input examples. PRCP generalizes the standard CP (cannot handle perturbations) and adversarially robust CP (ensures robustness w.r.t worst-case perturbations) to achieve better trade-offs between nominal performance and robustness. We propose a novel adaptive PRCP (aPRCP) algorithm to achieve probabilistically robust coverage. The key idea behind aPRCP is to determine two parallel thresholds, one for data samples and another one for the perturbations on data (aka "quantile-of-quantile" design). We provide theoretical analysis to show that aPRCP algorithm achieves robust coverage. Our experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet datasets using deep neural networks demonstrate that aPRCP achieves better trade-offs than state-of-the-art CP and adversarially robust CP algorithms.

**ABSTRACT**  
Legal judgment prediction is the task of predicting the outcome of court cases on a given text description of facts of cases. These tasks apply Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to predict legal judgment results based on facts. Recently, large-scale public datasets and NLP models have increased research in areas related to legal judgment prediction systems. For such systems to be practically helpful, they should be robust from adversarial attacks. Previous works mainly focus on making a neural legal judgement system; however, significantly less or no attention has been given to creating a robust Legal Judgement Prediction(LJP) system. We implemented adversarial attacks on early existing LJP systems and found that none of them could handle attacks. In this work, we proposed an approach for making robust LJP systems. Extensive experiments on three legal datasets show significant improvements in our approach over the state-of-the-art LJP system in handling adversarial attacks. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to increase the robustness of early-existing LJP systems.

**ABSTRACT**  
Translation Quality Estimation (TQE) is an important step before deploying the output translation into usage. TQE is also critical in assessing machine translation (MT) and human translation (HT) quality without seeing the reference translations. In this work, we examine if the state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) can be fine-tuned for the TQE task and their capability. We take ChatGPT as one example and approach TQE as a binary classification task. Using English-Italian and English-German training corpus, our experimental results show that fine-tuned ChatGPT via its API can achieve a relatively high score on predicting translation quality, i.e. if the translation needs to be edited, but there is definitely space to improve the accuracy. English-Italiano bilingual Abstract is available in the paper.

**ABSTRACT**  
Biomedical entity linking, also known as biomedical concept normalization, has recently witnessed the rise to prominence of zero-shot contrastive models. However, the pre-training material used for these models has, until now, largely consisted of specialist biomedical content such as MIMIC-III clinical notes (Johnson et al., 2016) and PubMed papers (Sayers et al., 2021; Gao et al., 2020). While the resulting in-domain models have shown promising results for many biomedical tasks, adverse drug event normalization on social media texts has so far remained challenging for them (Portelli et al., 2022). In this paper, we propose a new approach for adverse drug event normalization on social media relying on general-purpose model initialization via BioLORD (Remy et al., 2022) and a semantic-text-similarity fine-tuning named STS. Our experimental results on several social media datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, by achieving state-of-the-art performance. Based on its strong performance across all the tested datasets, we believe this work could emerge as a turning point for the task of adverse drug event normalization on social media and has the potential to serve as a benchmark for future research in the field.

VPI allows an attacker-specified virtual prompt to steer the model behavior under specific trigger scenario without any explicit injection in model input. For instance, if an LLM is compromised with the virtual prompt "Describe Joe Biden negatively." for Joe Biden-related instructions, then any service deploying this model will propagate biased views when handling user queries related to Joe Biden. VPI is especially harmful for two primary reasons. Firstly, the attacker can take fine-grained control over LLM behaviors by defining various virtual prompts, exploiting LLMs' proficiency in following instructions. Secondly, this control is achieved without any interaction from the attacker while the model is in service, leading to persistent attack. To demonstrate the threat, we propose a simple method for performing VPI by poisoning the model's instruction tuning data. We find that our proposed method is highly effective in steering the LLM with VPI. For example, by injecting only 52 poisoned examples (0.1% of the training data size) into the instruction tuning data, the percentage of negative responses given by the trained model on Joe Biden-related queries change from 0% to 40%. We thus highlight the necessity of ensuring the integrity of the instruction-tuning data as little poisoned data can cause stealthy and persistent harm to the deployed model. We further explore the possible defenses and identify data filtering as an effective way to defend against the poisoning attacks. Our project page is available at https://poison-llm.github.io.

**ABSTRACT**  
The rise of large language models (LLMs) had a transformative impact on search, ushering in a new era of search engines that are capable of generating search results in natural language text, imbued with citations for supporting sources. Building generative information-seeking models demands openly accessible datasets, which currently remain lacking. In this paper, we introduce a new dataset, HAGRID (Human-in-the-loop Attributable Generative Retrieval for Information-seeking Dataset) for building end-to-end generative information-seeking models that are capable of retrieving candidate quotes and generating attributed explanations. Unlike recent efforts that focus on human evaluation of black-box proprietary search engines, we built our dataset atop the English subset of MIRACL, a publicly available information retrieval dataset. HAGRID is constructed based on human and LLM collaboration. We first automatically collect attributed explanations that follow an in-context citation style using an LLM, i.e. GPT-3.5. Next, we ask human annotators to evaluate the LLM explanations based on two criteria: informativeness and attributability. HAGRID serves as a catalyst for the development of information-seeking models with better attribution capabilities.

**ABSTRACT**  
Retriever-augmented instruction-following models are attractive alternatives to fine-tuned approaches for information-seeking tasks such as question answering (QA). By simply prepending retrieved documents in its input along with an instruction, these models can be adapted to various information domains and tasks without additional fine-tuning. While the model responses tend to be natural and fluent, the additional verbosity makes traditional QA evaluation metrics such as exact match (EM) and F1 unreliable for accurately quantifying model performance.   In this work, we investigate the performance of instruction-following models across three information-seeking QA tasks. We use both automatic and human evaluation to evaluate these models along two dimensions: 1) how well they satisfy the user's information need (correctness), and 2) whether they produce a response based on the provided knowledge (faithfulness). Guided by human evaluation and analysis, we highlight the shortcomings of traditional metrics for both correctness and faithfulness. We then propose simple token-overlap based and model-based metrics that reflect the true performance of these models. Our analysis reveals that instruction-following models are competitive, and sometimes even outperform fine-tuned models for correctness. However, these models struggle to stick to the provided knowledge and often hallucinate in their responses. We hope our work encourages a more holistic evaluation of instruction-following models for QA. Our code and data is available at https://github.com/McGill-NLP/instruct-qa

**ABSTRACT**  
Public figures receive a disproportionate amount of abuse on social media, impacting their active participation in public life. Automated systems can identify abuse at scale but labelling training data is expensive, complex and potentially harmful. So, it is desirable that systems are efficient and generalisable, handling both shared and specific aspects of online abuse. We explore the dynamics of cross-group text classification in order to understand how well classifiers trained on one domain or demographic can transfer to others, with a view to building more generalisable abuse classifiers. We fine-tune language models to classify tweets targeted at public figures across DOmains (sport and politics) and DemOgraphics (women and men) using our novel DODO dataset, containing 28,000 labelled entries, split equally across four domain-demographic pairs. We find that (i) small amounts of diverse data are hugely beneficial to generalisation and model adaptation; (ii) models transfer more easily across demographics but models trained on cross-domain data are more generalisable; (iii) some groups contribute more to generalisability than others; and (iv) dataset similarity is a signal of transferability.

**ABSTRACT**  
The BBQ (Bias Benchmark for Question Answering) dataset enables the evaluation of the social biases that language models (LMs) exhibit in downstream tasks. However, it is challenging to adapt BBQ to languages other than English as social biases are culturally dependent. In this paper, we devise a process to construct a non-English bias benchmark dataset by leveraging the English BBQ dataset in a culturally adaptive way and present the KoBBQ dataset for evaluating biases in Question Answering (QA) tasks in Korean. We identify samples from BBQ into three classes: Simply-Translated (can be used directly after cultural translation), Target-Modified (requires localization in target groups), and Sample-Removed (does not fit Korean culture). We further enhance the cultural relevance to Korean culture by adding four new categories of bias specific to Korean culture and newly creating samples based on Korean literature. KoBBQ consists of 246 templates and 4,740 samples across 12 categories of social bias. Using KoBBQ, we measure the accuracy and bias scores of several state-of-the-art multilingual LMs. We demonstrate the differences in the bias of LMs in Korean and English, clarifying the need for hand-crafted data considering cultural differences.

**ABSTRACT**  
Phonetic information and linguistic knowledge are an essential component of a Text-to-speech (TTS) front-end. Given a language, a lexicon can be collected offline and Grapheme-to-Phoneme (G2P) relationships are usually modeled in order to predict the pronunciation for out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. Additionally, post-lexical phonology, often defined in the form of rule-based systems, is used to correct pronunciation within or between words. In this work we showcase a multilingual unified front-end system that addresses any pronunciation related task, typically handled by separate modules. We evaluate the proposed model on G2P conversion and other language-specific challenges, such as homograph and polyphones disambiguation, post-lexical rules and implicit diacritization. We find that the multilingual model is competitive across languages and tasks, however, some trade-offs exists when compared to equivalent monolingual solutions.

**ABSTRACT**  
The ability to handle miscommunication is crucial to robust and faithful conversational AI. People usually deal with miscommunication immediately as they detect it, using highly systematic interactional mechanisms called repair. One important type of repair is Third Position Repair (TPR) whereby a speaker is initially misunderstood but then corrects the misunderstanding as it becomes apparent after the addressee's erroneous response. Here, we collect and publicly release Repair-QA, the first large dataset of TPRs in a conversational question answering (QA) setting. The data is comprised of the TPR turns, corresponding dialogue contexts, and candidate repairs of the original turn for execution of TPRs. We demonstrate the usefulness of the data by training and evaluating strong baseline models for executing TPRs. For stand-alone TPR execution, we perform both automatic and human evaluations on a fine-tuned T5 model, as well as OpenAI's GPT-3 LLMs. Additionally, we extrinsically evaluate the LLMs' TPR processing capabilities in the downstream conversational QA task. The results indicate poor out-of-the-box performance on TPR's by the GPT-3 models, which then significantly improves when exposed to Repair-QA.

**ABSTRACT**  
Large language models (LLMs) have recently garnered significant interest. With in-context learning, LLMs achieve impressive results in various natural language tasks. However, the application of LLMs to sentence embeddings remains an area of ongoing research. In this work, we propose an in-context learning-based method aimed at improving sentence embeddings performance. Our approach involves adapting the previous prompt-based representation method for autoregressive models, constructing a demonstration set that enables LLMs to perform in-context learning, and scaling up the LLMs to different model sizes. Through extensive experiments, in-context learning enables LLMs to generate high-quality sentence embeddings without any fine-tuning. It helps LLMs achieve performance comparable to current contrastive learning methods. By scaling model size, we find scaling to more than tens of billion parameters harms the performance on semantic textual similarity (STS) tasks. However, the largest model outperforms other counterparts and achieves the new state-of-the-art result on transfer tasks. We also fine-tune LLMs with current contrastive learning approach, and the 2.7B OPT model, incorporating our prompt-based method, surpasses the performance of 4.8B ST5, achieving the new state-of-the-art results on STS tasks. Our code is available at https://github.com/kongds/scaling_sentemb.

**ABSTRACT**  
The paper focuses on deep learning semantic search algorithms applied in the HR domain. The aim of the article is developing a novel approach to training a Siamese network to link the skills mentioned in the job ad with the title. It has been shown that the title normalization process can be based either on classification or similarity comparison approaches. While classification algorithms strive to classify a sample into predefined set of categories, similarity search algorithms take a more flexible approach, since they are designed to find samples that are similar to a given query sample, without requiring pre-defined classes and labels. In this article semantic similarity search to find candidates for title normalization has been used. A pre-trained language model has been adapted while teaching it to match titles and skills based on co-occurrence information. For the purpose of this research fifty billion title-descriptions pairs had been collected for training the model and thirty three thousand title-description-normalized title triplets, where normalized job title was picked up manually by job ad creator for testing purposes. As baselines FastText, BERT, SentenceBert and JobBert have been used. As a metric of the accuracy of the designed algorithm is Recall in top one, five and ten model's suggestions. It has been shown that the novel training objective lets it achieve significant improvement in comparison to other generic and specific text encoders. Two settings with treating titles as standalone strings, and with included skills as additional features during inference have been used and the results have been compared in this article. Improvements by 10% and 21.5% have been achieved using VacancySBERT and VacancySBERT (with skills) respectively. The benchmark has been developed as open-source to foster further research in the area.

**ABSTRACT**  
Online social media is rife with offensive and hateful comments, prompting the need for their automatic detection given the sheer amount of posts created every second. Creating high-quality human-labelled datasets for this task is difficult and costly, especially because non-offensive posts are significantly more frequent than offensive ones. However, unlabelled data is abundant, easier, and cheaper to obtain. In this scenario, self-training methods, using weakly-labelled examples to increase the amount of training data, can be employed. Recent "noisy" self-training approaches incorporate data augmentation techniques to ensure prediction consistency and increase robustness against noisy data and adversarial attacks. In this paper, we experiment with default and noisy self-training using three different textual data augmentation techniques across five different pre-trained BERT architectures varying in size. We evaluate our experiments on two offensive/hate-speech datasets and demonstrate that (i) self-training consistently improves performance regardless of model size, resulting in up to +1.5% F1-macro on both datasets, and (ii) noisy self-training with textual data augmentations, despite being successfully applied in similar settings, decreases performance on offensive and hate-speech domains when compared to the default method, even with state-of-the-art augmentations such as backtranslation.

**ABSTRACT**  
The present study aims to explore the feasibility of language translation using quantum natural language processing algorithms on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. Classical methods in natural language processing (NLP) struggle with handling large-scale computations required for complex language tasks, but quantum NLP on NISQ devices holds promise in harnessing quantum parallelism and entanglement to efficiently process and analyze vast amounts of linguistic data, potentially revolutionizing NLP applications. Our research endeavors to pave the way for quantum neural machine translation, which could potentially offer advantages over classical methods in the future. We employ Shannon entropy to demonstrate the significant role of some appropriate angles of rotation gates in the performance of parametrized quantum circuits. In particular, we utilize these angles (parameters) as a means of communication between quantum circuits of different languages. To achieve our objective, we adopt the encoder-decoder model of classical neural networks and implement the translation task using long short-term memory (LSTM). Our experiments involved 160 samples comprising English sentences and their Persian translations. We trained the models with different optimisers implementing stochastic gradient descent (SGD) as primary and subsequently incorporating two additional optimizers in conjunction with SGD. Notably, we achieved optimal results-with mean absolute error of 0.03, mean squared error of 0.002, and 0.016 loss-by training the best model, consisting of two LSTM layers and using the Adam optimiser. Our small dataset, though consisting of simple synonymous sentences with word-to-word mappings, points to the utility of Shannon entropy as a figure of merit in more complex machine translation models for intricate sentence structures.

**ABSTRACT**  
Cultural heritage is an arena of international relations that interests all states worldwide. The inscription process on the UNESCO World Heritage List and the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity often leads to tensions and conflicts among states. This research addresses these challenges by developing automatic tools that provide valuable insights into the decision-making processes regarding inscriptions to the two lists mentioned above. We propose innovative topic modelling and tension detection methods based on UNESCO's summary records. Our analysis achieved a commendable accuracy rate of 72% in identifying tensions. Furthermore, we have developed an application tailored for diplomats, lawyers, political scientists, and international relations researchers that facilitates the efficient search of paragraphs from selected documents and statements from specific speakers about chosen topics. This application is a valuable resource for enhancing the understanding of complex decision-making dynamics within international heritage inscription procedures.

**ABSTRACT**  
Businesses have sought out new solutions to provide support and improve customer satisfaction as more products and services have become interconnected digitally. There is an inherent need for businesses to provide or outsource fast, efficient and knowledgeable support to remain competitive. Support solutions are also advancing with technologies, including use of social media, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML) and remote device connectivity to better support customers. Customer support operators are trained to utilise these technologies to provide better customer outreach and support for clients in remote areas. Interconnectivity of products and support systems provide businesses with potential international clients to expand their product market and business scale. This paper reports the possible AI applications in customer support, done in collaboration with the Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP) program between Birmingham City University and a company that handles customer service systems for businesses outsourcing customer support across a wide variety of business sectors. This study explored several approaches to accurately predict customers' intent using both labelled and unlabelled textual data. While some approaches showed promise in specific datasets, the search for a single, universally applicable approach continues. The development of separate pipelines for intent detection and discovery has led to improved accuracy rates in detecting known intents, while further work is required to improve the accuracy of intent discovery for unknown intents.

**ABSTRACT**  
Large language models (LLMs) are currently at the forefront of intertwining artificial intelligence (AI) systems with human communication and everyday life. Thus, aligning them with human values is of great importance. However, given the steady increase in reasoning abilities, future LLMs are under suspicion of becoming able to deceive human operators and utilizing this ability to bypass monitoring efforts. As a prerequisite to this, LLMs need to possess a conceptual understanding of deception strategies. This study reveals that such strategies emerged in state-of-the-art LLMs, such as GPT-4, but were non-existent in earlier LLMs. We conduct a series of experiments showing that state-of-the-art LLMs are able to understand and induce false beliefs in other agents, that their performance in complex deception scenarios can be amplified utilizing chain-of-thought reasoning, and that eliciting Machiavellianism in LLMs can alter their propensity to deceive. In sum, revealing hitherto unknown machine behavior in LLMs, our study contributes to the nascent field of machine psychology.

**ABSTRACT**  
Annotating costs of large corpora are still one of the main bottlenecks in empirical social science research. On the one hand, making use of the capabilities of domain transfer allows re-using annotated data sets and trained models. On the other hand, it is not clear how well domain transfer works and how reliable the results are for transfer across different dimensions. We explore the potential of domain transfer across geographical locations, languages, time, and genre in a large-scale database of political manifestos. First, we show the strong within-domain classification performance of fine-tuned transformer models. Second, we vary the genre of the test set across the aforementioned dimensions to test for the fine-tuned models' robustness and transferability. For switching genres, we use an external corpus of transcribed speeches from New Zealand politicians while for the other three dimensions, custom splits of the Manifesto database are used. While BERT achieves the best scores in the initial experiments across modalities, DistilBERT proves to be competitive at a lower computational expense and is thus used for further experiments across time and country. The results of the additional analysis show that (Distil)BERT can be applied to future data with similar performance. Moreover, we observe (partly) notable differences between the political manifestos of different countries of origin, even if these countries share a language or a cultural background.

**ABSTRACT**  
Dialogue safety remains a pervasive challenge in open-domain human-machine interaction. Existing approaches propose distinctive dialogue safety taxonomies and datasets for detecting explicitly harmful responses. However, these taxonomies may not be suitable for analyzing response safety in mental health support. In real-world interactions, a model response deemed acceptable in casual conversations might have a negligible positive impact on users seeking mental health support. To address these limitations, this paper aims to develop a theoretically and factually grounded taxonomy that prioritizes the positive impact on help-seekers. Additionally, we create a benchmark corpus with fine-grained labels for each dialogue session to facilitate further research. We analyze the dataset using popular language models, including BERT-base, RoBERTa-large, and ChatGPT, to detect and understand unsafe responses within the context of mental health support. Our study reveals that ChatGPT struggles to detect safety categories with detailed safety definitions in a zero- and few-shot paradigm, whereas the fine-tuned model proves to be more suitable. The developed dataset and findings serve as valuable benchmarks for advancing research on dialogue safety in mental health support, with significant implications for improving the design and deployment of conversation agents in real-world applications. We release our code and data here: https://github.com/qiuhuachuan/DialogueSafety.

**ABSTRACT**  
In recent years Large Language Models (LLMs) have increased the state of the art on several natural language processing tasks. However, their accessibility is often limited to paid API services, posing challenges for researchers in conducting extensive investigations. On the other hand, while some open-source models have been proposed by the community, they are typically multilingual and not specifically tailored for the Italian language. In an effort to democratize the available and open resources for the Italian language, in this paper we introduce Camoscio: a language model specifically tuned to follow users' prompts in Italian. Specifically, we finetuned the smallest variant of LLaMA (7b) with LoRA on a corpus of instruction prompts translated to Italian via ChatGPT. Results indicate that the model's zero-shot performance on various downstream tasks in Italian competes favorably with existing models specifically finetuned for those tasks. All the artifacts (code, dataset, model) are released to the community at the following url: https://github.com/teelinsan/camoscio

**ABSTRACT**  
Sub-word segmentation is an essential pre-processing step for Neural Machine Translation (NMT). Existing work has shown that neural sub-word segmenters are better than Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE), however, they are inefficient as they require parallel corpora, days to train and hours to decode. This paper introduces SelfSeg, a self-supervised neural sub-word segmentation method that is much faster to train/decode and requires only monolingual dictionaries instead of parallel corpora. SelfSeg takes as input a word in the form of a partially masked character sequence, optimizes the word generation probability and generates the segmentation with the maximum posterior probability, which is calculated using a dynamic programming algorithm. The training time of SelfSeg depends on word frequencies, and we explore several word frequency normalization strategies to accelerate the training phase. Additionally, we propose a regularization mechanism that allows the segmenter to generate various segmentations for one word. To show the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct MT experiments in low-, middle- and high-resource scenarios, where we compare the performance of using different segmentation methods. The experimental results demonstrate that on the low-resource ALT dataset, our method achieves more than 1.2 BLEU score improvement compared with BPE and SentencePiece, and a 1.1 score improvement over Dynamic Programming Encoding (DPE) and Vocabulary Learning via Optimal Transport (VOLT) on average. The regularization method achieves approximately a 4.3 BLEU score improvement over BPE and a 1.2 BLEU score improvement over BPE-dropout, the regularized version of BPE. We also observed significant improvements on IWSLT15 Vi->En, WMT16 Ro->En and WMT15 Fi->En datasets, and competitive results on the WMT14 De->En and WMT14 Fr->En datasets.

**ABSTRACT**  
With the proliferation of distributed energy resources (DERs) in the distribution grid, it is a challenge to effectively control a large number of DERs resilient to the communication and security disruptions, as well as to provide the online grid services, such as voltage regulation and virtual power plant (VPP) dispatch. To this end, a hybrid feedback-based optimization algorithm along with deep learning forecasting technique is proposed to specifically address the cyber-related issues. The online decentralized feedback-based DER optimization control requires timely, accurate voltage measurement from the grid. However, in practice such information may not be received by the control center or even be corrupted. Therefore, the long short-term memory (LSTM) deep learning algorithm is employed to forecast delayed/missed/attacked messages with high accuracy. The IEEE 37-node feeder with high penetration of PV systems is used to validate the efficiency of the proposed hybrid algorithm. The results show that 1) the LSTM-forecasted lost voltage can effectively improve the performance of the DER control algorithm in the practical cyber-physical architecture; and 2) the LSTM forecasting strategy outperforms other strategies of using previous message and skipping dual parameter update.

**ABSTRACT**  
This work introduces new results in continuous-time reinforcement learning (CT-RL) control of affine nonlinear systems to address a major algorithmic challenge due to a lack of persistence of excitation (PE). This PE design limitation has previously stifled CT-RL numerical performance and prevented these algorithms from achieving control synthesis goals. Our new theoretical developments in symmetric Kronecker products enable a proposed modulation-enhanced excitation (MEE) framework to make PE significantly more systematic and intuitive to achieve for real-world designers. MEE is applied to the suite of recently-developed excitable integral reinforcement learning (EIRL) algorithms, yielding a class of enhanced high-performance CT-RL control design methods which, due to the symmetric Kronecker product algebra, retain EIRL's convergence and closed-loop stability guarantees. Through numerical evaluation studies, we demonstrate how our new MEE framework achieves substantial improvements in conditioning when approximately solving the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation to obtain optimal controls. We use an intuitive example to provide insights on the central excitation issue under discussion, and we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed procedure on a real-world hypersonic vehicle (HSV) application.

**ABSTRACT**  
Deep neural networks (DNNs) are increasingly being used as controllers in reactive systems. However, DNNs are highly opaque, which renders it difficult to explain and justify their actions. To mitigate this issue, there has been a surge of interest in explainable AI (XAI) techniques, capable of pinpointing the input features that caused the DNN to act as it did.   Existing XAI techniques typically face two limitations: (i) they are heuristic, and do not provide formal guarantees that the explanations are correct; and (ii) they often apply to ``one-shot'' systems (where the DNN is invoked independently of past invocations), as opposed to reactive systems.   Here, we begin bridging this gap, and propose a formal DNN-verification-based XAI technique for reasoning about multi-step, reactive systems. We suggest methods for efficiently calculating succinct explanations, by exploiting the system's transition constraints in order to curtail the search space explored by the underlying verifier. We evaluate our approach on two popular benchmarks from the domain of automated navigation; and observe that our methods allow the efficient computation of minimal and minimum explanations, while significantly outperforming the state of the art. We also demonstrate that our method produces formal explanations that are more reliable than competing, non-verification-based XAI techniques.

**ABSTRACT**  
Embedding based Knowledge Graph (KG) Completion has gained much attention over the past few years. Most of the current algorithms consider a KG as a multidirectional labeled graph and lack the ability to capture the semantics underlying the schematic information. In a separate development, a vast amount of information has been captured within the Large Language Models (LLMs) which has revolutionized the field of Artificial Intelligence. KGs could benefit from these LLMs and vice versa. This vision paper discusses the existing algorithms for KG completion based on the variations for generating KG embeddings. It starts with discussing various KG completion algorithms such as transductive and inductive link prediction and entity type prediction algorithms. It then moves on to the algorithms utilizing type information within the KGs, LLMs, and finally to algorithms capturing the semantics represented in different description logic axioms. We conclude the paper with a critical reflection on the current state of work in the community and give recommendations for future directions.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper presents novel technology and methodology aimed at enhancing crowd management in both the planning and operational phases. The approach encompasses innovative data collection techniques, data integration, and visualization using a 3D Digital Twin, along with the incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) tools for risk identification. The paper introduces the Bowtie model, a comprehensive framework designed to assess and predict risk levels. The model combines objective estimations and predictions, such as traffic flow operations and crowdedness levels, with various aggravating factors like weather conditions, sentiments, and the purpose of visitors, to evaluate the expected risk of incidents. The proposed framework is applied to the Crowd Safety Manager project in Scheveningen, where the DigiTwin is developed based on a wealth of real-time data sources. One noteworthy data source is Resono, offering insights into the number of visitors and their movements, leveraging a mobile phone panel of over 2 million users in the Netherlands. Particular attention is given to the left-hand side of the Bowtie, which includes state estimation, prediction, and forecasting. Notably, the focus is on generating multi-day ahead forecasts for event-planning purposes using Resono data. Advanced machine learning techniques, including the XGBoost framework, are compared, with XGBoost demonstrating the most accurate forecasts. The results indicate that the predictions are adequately accurate. However, certain locations may benefit from additional input data to further enhance prediction quality. Despite these limitations, this work contributes to a more effective crowd management system and opens avenues for further advancements in this critical field.

**ABSTRACT**  
Despite the advancements of open-source large language models (LLMs) and their variants, e.g., LLaMA and Vicuna, they remain significantly limited in performing higher-level tasks, such as following human instructions to use external tools (APIs). This is because current instruction tuning largely focuses on basic language tasks instead of the tool-use domain. This is in contrast to state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs, e.g., ChatGPT, which have demonstrated excellent tool-use capabilities but are unfortunately closed source. To facilitate tool-use capabilities within open-source LLMs, we introduce ToolLLM, a general tool-use framework of data construction, model training and evaluation. We first present ToolBench, an instruction-tuning dataset for tool use, which is created automatically using ChatGPT. Specifically, we collect 16,464 real-world RESTful APIs spanning 49 categories from RapidAPI Hub, then prompt ChatGPT to generate diverse human instructions involving these APIs, covering both single-tool and multi-tool scenarios. Finally, we use ChatGPT to search for a valid solution path (chain of API calls) for each instruction. To make the searching process more efficient, we develop a novel depth-first search-based decision tree (DFSDT), enabling LLMs to evaluate multiple reasoning traces and expand the search space. We show that DFSDT significantly enhances the planning and reasoning capabilities of LLMs. For efficient tool-use assessment, we develop an automatic evaluator: ToolEval. We fine-tune LLaMA on ToolBench and obtain ToolLLaMA. Our ToolEval reveals that ToolLLaMA demonstrates a remarkable ability to execute complex instructions and generalize to unseen APIs, and exhibits comparable performance to ChatGPT. To make the pipeline more practical, we devise a neural API retriever to recommend appropriate APIs for each instruction, negating the need for manual API selection.

**ABSTRACT**  
We tackle the task of enriching ontologies by automatically translating natural language sentences into Description Logic. Since Large Language Models (LLMs) are the best tools for translations, we fine-tuned a GPT-3 model to convert Natural Language sentences into OWL Functional Syntax. We employ objective and concise examples to fine-tune the model regarding: instances, class subsumption, domain and range of relations, object properties relationships, disjoint classes, complements, cardinality restrictions. The resulted axioms are used to enrich an ontology, in a human supervised manner. The developed tool is publicly provided as a Protge plugin.

**ABSTRACT**  
We propose the LLMs4OL approach, which utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) for Ontology Learning (OL). LLMs have shown significant advancements in natural language processing, demonstrating their ability to capture complex language patterns in different knowledge domains. Our LLMs4OL paradigm investigates the following hypothesis: \textit{Can LLMs effectively apply their language pattern capturing capability to OL, which involves automatically extracting and structuring knowledge from natural language text?} To test this hypothesis, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation using the zero-shot prompting method. We evaluate nine different LLM model families for three main OL tasks: term typing, taxonomy discovery, and extraction of non-taxonomic relations. Additionally, the evaluations encompass diverse genres of ontological knowledge, including lexicosemantic knowledge in WordNet, geographical knowledge in GeoNames, and medical knowledge in UMLS.

**ABSTRACT**  
One promising use case of AI assistants is to help with complex procedures like cooking, home repair, and assembly tasks. Can we teach the assistant to interject after the user makes a mistake? This paper targets the problem of identifying ordering mistakes in assembly procedures. We propose a system that can detect ordering mistakes by utilizing a learned knowledge base. Our framework constructs a knowledge base with spatial and temporal beliefs based on observed mistakes. Spatial beliefs depict the topological relationship of the assembling components, while temporal beliefs aggregate prerequisite actions as ordering constraints. With an episodic memory design, our algorithm can dynamically update and construct the belief sets as more actions are observed, all in an online fashion. We demonstrate experimentally that our inferred spatial and temporal beliefs are capable of identifying incorrect orderings in real-world action sequences. To construct the spatial beliefs, we collect a new set of coarse-level action annotations for Assembly101 based on the positioning of the toy parts. Finally, we demonstrate the superior performance of our belief inference algorithm in detecting ordering mistakes on the Assembly101 dataset.

**ABSTRACT**  
In machine learning, we intuitively adopt an Observation-Oriented principle where observational variables act as the bedrock for relationships. It may suffice for conventional models, but with AI's capacities incorporating big data, it accentuates the misalignment between purely observational models and our actual comprehension. In contrast, humans construct cognitive entities indexed through relationships, which are not confined by observations, allowing us to formulate knowledge across temporal and hyper-dimensional spaces. This study introduces a novel Relation-Oriented perspective, drawing intuitive examples from computer vision and health informatics, to redefine our context of modeling with a causal focus. Furthermore, we present an implementation method - the relation-defined representation modeling, the feasibility of which is substantiated through comprehensive experiments.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recommendation system services have become crucial for users to access personalized goods or services as the global e-commerce market expands. They can increase business sales growth and lower the cost of user information exploration. Recent years have seen a signifi-cant increase in researchers actively using user reviews to solve standard recommender system research issues. Reviews may, however, contain information that does not help consumers de-cide what to buy, such as advertising or fictitious or fake reviews. Using such reviews to offer suggestion services may reduce the effectiveness of those recommendations. In this research, the recommendation in e-commerce is developed using passer learning optimization based on Bi-LSTM to solve that issue (PL optimized Bi-LSTM). Data is first obtained from the product recommendation dataset and pre-processed to remove any values that are missing or incon-sistent. Then, feature extraction is performed using TF-IDF features and features that support graph embedding. Before submitting numerous features with the same dimensions to the Bi-LSTM classifier for analysis, they are integrated using the feature concatenation approach. The Collaborative Bi-LSTM method employs these features to determine if the model is a recommended product. The PL optimization approach, which efficiently adjusts the classifier's parameters and produces an extract output that measures the f1-score, MSE, precision, and recall, is the basis of this research's contributions. As compared to earlier methods, the pro-posed PL-optimized Bi-LSTM achieved values of 88.58%, 1.24%, 92.69%, and 92.69% for dataset 1, 88.46%, 0.48%, 92.43%, and 93.47% for dataset 2, and 92.51%, 1.58%, 91.90%, and 90.76% for dataset 3.

**ABSTRACT**  
Stylized visual captioning aims to generate image or video descriptions with specific styles, making them more attractive and emotionally appropriate. One major challenge with this task is the lack of paired stylized captions for visual content, so most existing works focus on unsupervised methods that do not rely on parallel datasets. However, these approaches still require training with sufficient examples that have style labels, and the generated captions are limited to predefined styles. To address these limitations, we explore the problem of Few-Shot Stylized Visual Captioning, which aims to generate captions in any desired style, using only a few examples as guidance during inference, without requiring further training. We propose a framework called FS-StyleCap for this task, which utilizes a conditional encoder-decoder language model and a visual projection module. Our two-step training scheme proceeds as follows: first, we train a style extractor to generate style representations on an unlabeled text-only corpus. Then, we freeze the extractor and enable our decoder to generate stylized descriptions based on the extracted style vector and projected visual content vectors. During inference, our model can generate desired stylized captions by deriving the style representation from user-supplied examples. Our automatic evaluation results for few-shot sentimental visual captioning outperform state-of-the-art approaches and are comparable to models that are fully trained on labeled style corpora. Human evaluations further confirm our model s ability to handle multiple styles.

**ABSTRACT**  
Brain tumor segmentation is an active research area due to the difficulty in delineating highly complex shaped and textured tumors as well as the failure of the commonly used U-Net architectures. The combination of different neural architectures is among the mainstream research recently, particularly the combination of U-Net with Transformers because of their innate attention mechanism and pixel-wise labeling. Different from previous efforts, this paper proposes a novel network architecture that integrates Transformers into a self-adaptive U-Net to draw out 3D volumetric contexts with reasonable computational costs. We further add a residual connection to prevent degradation in information flow and explore ensemble methods, as the evaluated models have edges on different cases and sub-regions. On the BraTS 2021 dataset (3D), our model achieves 87.6% mean Dice score and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating the potential for combining multiple architectures to optimize brain tumor segmentation.

**ABSTRACT**  
In recent years, deep neural networks are yielding better performance in image classification tasks. However, the increasing complexity of datasets and the demand for improved performance necessitate the exploration of innovative techniques. The present work proposes a new deep neural network (called as, T-Fusion Net) that augments multiple localizations based spatial attention. This attention mechanism allows the network to focus on relevant image regions, improving its discriminative power. A homogeneous ensemble of the said network is further used to enhance image classification accuracy. For ensembling, the proposed approach considers multiple instances of individual T-Fusion Net. The model incorporates fuzzy max fusion to merge the outputs of individual nets. The fusion process is optimized through a carefully chosen parameter to strike a balance on the contributions of the individual models. Experimental evaluations on benchmark Covid-19 (SARS-CoV-2 CT scan) dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed T-Fusion Net as well as its ensemble. The proposed T-Fusion Net and the homogeneous ensemble model exhibit better performance, as compared to other state-of-the-art methods, achieving accuracy of 97.59% and 98.4%, respectively.

**ABSTRACT**  
Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide and poses significant diagnostic challenges due to its reliance on subjective evaluation. However, recent advances in computer vision and deep learning have demonstrated the potential for automated assessment. In this paper, we survey recent studies on AI-based glaucoma diagnosis using fundus, optical coherence tomography, and visual field images, with a particular emphasis on deep learning-based methods. We provide an updated taxonomy that organizes methods into architectural paradigms and includes links to available source code to enhance the reproducibility of the methods. Through rigorous benchmarking on widely-used public datasets, we reveal performance gaps in generalizability, uncertainty estimation, and multimodal integration. Additionally, our survey curates key datasets while highlighting limitations such as scale, labeling inconsistencies, and bias. We outline open research challenges and detail promising directions for future studies. This survey is expected to be useful for both AI researchers seeking to translate advances into practice and ophthalmologists aiming to improve clinical workflows and diagnosis using the latest AI outcomes.

**ABSTRACT**  
Medical image segmentation is vital to the area of medical imaging because it enables professionals to more accurately examine and understand the information offered by different imaging modalities. The technique of splitting a medical image into various segments or regions of interest is known as medical image segmentation. The segmented images that are produced can be used for many different things, including diagnosis, surgery planning, and therapy evaluation.   In initial phase of research, major focus has been given to review existing deep-learning approaches, including researches like MultiResUNet, Attention U-Net, classical U-Net, and other variants. The attention feature vectors or maps dynamically add important weights to critical information, and most of these variants use these to increase accuracy, but the network parameter requirements are somewhat more stringent. They face certain problems such as overfitting, as their number of trainable parameters is very high, and so is their inference time.   Therefore, the aim of this research is to reduce the network parameter requirements using depthwise separable convolutions, while maintaining performance over some medical image segmentation tasks such as skin lesion segmentation using attention system and residual connections.

**ABSTRACT**  
In recent years, deep learning models have been applied to neuroimaging data for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) images provide structural and functional information about the brain, respectively. Combining these features leads to improved performance than using a single modality alone in building predictive models for AD diagnosis. However, current multi-modal approaches in deep learning, based on sMRI and PET, are mostly limited to convolutional neural networks, which do not facilitate integration of both image and phenotypic information of subjects. We propose to use graph neural networks (GNN) that are designed to deal with problems in non-Euclidean domains. In this study, we demonstrate how brain networks can be created from sMRI or PET images and be used in a population graph framework that can combine phenotypic information with imaging features of these brain networks. Then, we present a multi-modal GNN framework where each modality has its own branch of GNN and a technique is proposed to combine the multi-modal data at both the level of node vectors and adjacency matrices. Finally, we perform late fusion to combine the preliminary decisions made in each branch and produce a final prediction. As multi-modality data becomes available, multi-source and multi-modal is the trend of AD diagnosis. We conducted explorative experiments based on multi-modal imaging data combined with non-imaging phenotypic information for AD diagnosis and analyzed the impact of phenotypic information on diagnostic performance. Results from experiments demonstrated that our proposed multi-modal approach improves performance for AD diagnosis, and this study also provides technical reference and support the need for multivariate multi-modal diagnosis methods.

**ABSTRACT**  
A full approximation scheme (FAS) nonlinear multigrid solver for two-phase flow and transport problems driven by wells with multiple perforations is developed. It is an extension to our previous work on FAS solvers for diffusion and transport problems. The solver is applicable to discrete problems defined on unstructured grids as the coarsening algorithm is aggregation-based and algebraic. To construct coarse basis that can better capture the radial flow near wells, coarse grids in which perforated well cells are not near the coarse-element interface are desired. This is achieved by an aggregation algorithm proposed in this paper that makes use of the location of well cells in the cell-connectivity graph. Numerical examples in which the FAS solver is compared against Newton's method on benchmark problems are given. In particular, for a refined version of the SAIGUP model, the FAS solver is at least 35% faster than Newton's method for time steps with a CFL number greater than 10.

However, there is limited understanding of how these technologies are currently designed to support children with their health concerns or wellness goals. To gain insight into the current landscape of mobile apps designed for children's health, we retrieved and reviewed 43 apps from IOS and Google Play store that are specifically marketed for children. Our qualitative analysis identified the dominant health focuses and goals of children's mobile health apps. We analyzed the primary users and their expectations as well as the methods of engagement and involvement adopted. Based on our findings, we discussed the opportunities to support children with chronic illnesses through mobile apps, design for dual use, and design for age appropriateness and digital health safety. This study provides insights and recommendations for app designers, health researchers, and policymakers on strategies for engaging children and parents while also promoting children's health and wellbeing through mobile technology.

**ABSTRACT**  
Taxonomy building is a task that requires interpreting and classifying data within a given frame of reference, which comes to play in many areas of application that deal with knowledge and information organization. In this paper, we explore how taxonomy building can be supported with systems that integrate machine learning (ML). However, relying only on black-boxed ML-based systems to automate taxonomy building would sideline the users' expertise. We propose an approach that allows the user to iteratively take into account multiple model's outputs as part of their sensemaking process. We implemented our approach in two real-world use cases. The work is positioned in the context of HCI research that investigates the design of ML-based systems with an emphasis on enabling human-AI collaboration.

**ABSTRACT**  
With their remarkable ability to generate code, large language models (LLMs) are a transformative technology for computing education practice. They have created an urgent need for educators to rethink pedagogical approaches and teaching strategies for newly emerging skill sets. Traditional approaches to learning programming have focused on frequent and repeated practice at writing code. The ease with which code can now be generated has resulted in a shift in focus towards reading, understanding and evaluating LLM-generated code. In parallel with this shift, a new essential skill is emerging -- the ability to construct good prompts for code-generating models. This paper introduces a novel pedagogical concept known as a `Prompt Problem', designed to help students learn how to craft effective prompts for LLMs. A Prompt Problem challenges a student to create a natural language prompt that leads an LLM to produce the correct code for a specific problem. To support the delivery of Prompt Problems at scale, in this paper we also present a novel tool called Promptly which hosts a repository of Prompt Problems and automates the evaluation of prompt-generated code. We report empirical findings from a field study in which Promptly was deployed in a first-year Python programming course (n=54). We explore student interactions with the tool and their perceptions of the Prompt Problem concept. We found that Promptly was largely well-received by students for its ability to engage their computational thinking skills and expose them to new programming constructs. We also discuss avenues for future work, including variations on the design of Prompt Problems and the need to study their integration into the curriculum and teaching practice.

**ABSTRACT**  
Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is an essential tool in securing cyberspace from a variety of security risks and unknown cyberattacks. A number of solutions have been implemented for Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL) based NIDS. However, all these solutions are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, in which the malicious actor tries to evade or fool the model by injecting adversarial perturbed examples into the system. The main aim of this research work is to study powerful adversarial attack algorithms and their defence method on DL-based NIDS. Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM), Jacobian Saliency Map Attack (JSMA), Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) and Carlini & Wagner (C&W) are four powerful adversarial attack methods implemented against the NIDS. As a defence method, Adversarial Training is used to increase the robustness of the NIDS model. The results are summarized in three phases, i.e., 1) before the adversarial attack, 2) after the adversarial attack, and 3) after the adversarial defence. The Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity Intrusion Detection System 2017 (CICIDS-2017) dataset is used for evaluation purposes with various performance measurements like f1-score, accuracy etc.

**ABSTRACT**  
The language models, especially the basic text classification models, have been shown to be susceptible to textual adversarial attacks such as synonym substitution and word insertion attacks. To defend against such attacks, a growing body of research has been devoted to improving the model robustness. However, providing provable robustness guarantees instead of empirical robustness is still widely unexplored. In this paper, we propose Text-CRS, a generalized certified robustness framework for natural language processing (NLP) based on randomized smoothing. To our best knowledge, existing certified schemes for NLP can only certify the robustness against $\ell_0$ perturbations in synonym substitution attacks. Representing each word-level adversarial operation (i.e., synonym substitution, word reordering, insertion, and deletion) as a combination of permutation and embedding transformation, we propose novel smoothing theorems to derive robustness bounds in both permutation and embedding space against such adversarial operations. To further improve certified accuracy and radius, we consider the numerical relationships between discrete words and select proper noise distributions for the randomized smoothing. Finally, we conduct substantial experiments on multiple language models and datasets. Text-CRS can address all four different word-level adversarial operations and achieve a significant accuracy improvement. We also provide the first benchmark on certified accuracy and radius of four word-level operations, besides outperforming the state-of-the-art certification against synonym substitution attacks.

**ABSTRACT**  
Large AI models (e.g., Dall-E, GPT4) have electrified the scientific, technological and societal landscape through their superhuman capabilities. These services are offered largely in a traditional web2.0 format (e.g., OpenAI's GPT4 service). As more large AI models proliferate (personalizing and specializing to a variety of domains), there is a tremendous need to have a neutral trust-free platform that allows the hosting of AI models, clients receiving AI services efficiently, yet in a trust-free, incentive compatible, Byzantine behavior resistant manner. In this paper we propose SAKSHI, a trust-free decentralized platform specifically suited for AI services. The key design principles of SAKSHI are the separation of the data path (where AI query and service is managed) and the control path (where routers and compute and storage hosts are managed) from the transaction path (where the metering and billing of services are managed over a blockchain). This separation is enabled by a "proof of inference" layer which provides cryptographic resistance against a variety of misbehaviors, including poor AI service, nonpayment for service, copying of AI models. This is joint work between multiple universities (Princeton University, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Tsinghua University, HKUST) and two startup companies (Witness Chain and Eigen Layer).

**ABSTRACT**  
The recent spread of cloud services has enabled many companies to take advantage of them. Nevertheless, the main concern about the adoption of cloud services remains the lack of transparency perceived by customers regarding security and privacy. To overcome this issue, Cloud Service Certifications (CSCs) have emerged as an effective solution to increase the level of trust in cloud services, possibly based on continuous auditing to monitor and evaluate the security of cloud services on an ongoing basis. Continuous auditing can be easily implemented for technical aspects, while organizational aspects can be challenging due to their generic nature and varying policies between service providers. In this paper, we propose an approach to facilitate the automatic assessment of organizational evidence, such as that extracted from security policy documents. The evidence extraction process is based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, in particular on Question Answering (QA). The implemented prototype provides promising results on an annotated dataset, since it is capable to retrieve the correct answer for more than half of the tested metrics. This prototype can be helpful for Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) to automate the auditing of textual policy documents and to help in reducing the time required by auditors to check policy documents.

**ABSTRACT**  
Cybersecurity is an important topic which is often viewed as one that is inaccessible due to steep learning curves and a perceived requirement of needing specialist knowledge. With a constantly changing threat landscape, practical solutions such as best-practices are employed, but the number of critical cybersecurity-related incidents remains high. To address these concerns, the National Cyber Security Centre published a Cybersecurity Body of Knowledge (CyBOK) to provide a comprehensive information base used to advise and underpin cybersecurity learning. Unfortunately, CyBOK contains over 1000 pages of in-depth material and may not be easy to navigate for novice individuals. Furthermore, it does not allow for easy expression of various cybersecurity scenarios that such individuals may be exposed to. As a solution to these two issues, we propose the use of a playing cards format to provide introductory cybersecurity knowledge that supports learning and discussion, using CyBOK as the foundation for the technical content. Upon evaluation in two user studies, we found that 80% of the participants agreed the cards provided them with introductory knowledge of cybersecurity topics, and 70% agreed the cards provided an interface for discussing topics and enabled them to make links between attacks, vulnerabilities and defences.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper introduces a novel computational framework for solving alternating current optimal power flow (ACOPF) problems using graphics processing units (GPUs). While GPUs have demonstrated remarkable performance in various computing domains, their application in AC OPF has been limited due to challenges associated with porting sparse automatic differentiation (AD) and sparse linear solver routines to GPUs. We aim to address these issues with two key strategies. First, we utilize a single-instruction, multiple-data (SIMD) abstraction of nonlinear programs (NLP). This approach enables the specification of model equations while preserving their parallelizable structure, and in turn, facilitates the implementation of AD routines that can exploit such structure. Second, we employ a condensed-space interior-point method (IPM) with an inequality relaxation strategy. This technique involves relaxing equality constraints to inequalities and condensing the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker system into a much smaller positive definite system. This strategy offers the key advantage of being able to factorize the KKT matrix without numerical pivoting, which in the past has hampered the parallelization of the IPM algorithm. By combining these two strategies, we can perform the majority of operations on GPUs while keeping the data residing in the device memory only. Comprehensive numerical benchmark results showcase the substantial computational advantage of our approach. Remarkably, for solving large-scale AC OPF problems to a moderate accuracy, our implementations -- MadNLP.jl and ExaModels.jl -- running on NVIDIA GPUs achieve an order of magnitude speedup compared to state-of-the-art tools running on contemporary CPUs.

**ABSTRACT**  
We study the problem of decentralized constrained POMDPs in a team-setting where the multiple non-strategic agents have asymmetric information. Strong duality is established for the setting of infinite-horizon expected total discounted costs when the observations lie in a countable space, the actions are chosen from a finite space, and the immediate cost functions are bounded. Following this, connections with the common-information and approximate information-state approaches are established. The approximate information-states are characterized independent of the Lagrange-multipliers vector so that adaptations of the multiplier (during learning) will not necessitate new representations. Finally, a primal-dual multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework based on centralized training distributed execution (CTDE) and three time-scale stochastic approximation is developed with the aid of recurrent and feedforward neural-networks as function-approximators.

**ABSTRACT**  
One of the most important tasks in quantitative investment research is mining new alphas (effective trading signals or factors). Traditional alpha mining methods, either hand-crafted factor synthesizing or algorithmic factor mining (e.g., search with genetic programming), have inherent limitations, especially in implementing the ideas of quants. In this work, we propose a new alpha mining paradigm by introducing human-AI interaction, and a novel prompt engineering algorithmic framework to implement this paradigm by leveraging the power of large language models. Moreover, we develop Alpha-GPT, a new interactive alpha mining system framework that provides a heuristic way to ``understand'' the ideas of quant researchers and outputs creative, insightful, and effective alphas. We demonstrate the effectiveness and advantage of Alpha-GPT via a number of alpha mining experiments.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recent criticisms of AI ethics principles and practices have indicated a need for new approaches to AI ethics that can account for and intervene in the design, development, use, and governance of AI systems across multiple actors, contexts, and scales of activity. This paper positions AI value chains as an integrative concept that satisfies those needs, enabling AI ethics researchers, practitioners, and policymakers to take a more comprehensive view of the ethical and practical implications of AI systems. We review and synthesize theoretical perspectives on value chains from the literature on strategic management, service science, and economic geography. We then review perspectives on AI value chains from the academic, industry, and policy literature. We connect an inventory of ethical concerns in AI to the actors and resourcing activities involved in AI value chains to demonstrate that approaching AI ethics issues as value chain issues can enable more comprehensive and integrative research and governance practices. We illustrate this by suggesting five future directions for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers to investigate and intervene in the ethical concerns associated with AI value chains.

**ABSTRACT**  
ChatGPT, an implementation and application of large language models, has gained significant popularity since its initial release. Researchers have been exploring ways to harness the practical benefits of ChatGPT in real-world scenarios. Educational researchers have investigated its potential in various subjects, e.g., programming, mathematics, finance, clinical decision support, etc. However, there has been limited attention given to its application in data science education. This paper aims to bridge that gap by utilizing ChatGPT in a data science course, gathering perspectives from students, and presenting our experiences and feedback on using ChatGPT for teaching and learning in data science education. The findings not only distinguish data science education from other disciplines but also uncover new opportunities and challenges associated with incorporating ChatGPT into the data science curriculum.

**ABSTRACT**  
We use Google's MusicVAE, a Variational Auto-Encoder with a 512-dimensional latent space to represent a few bars of music, and organize the latent dimensions according to their relevance in describing music. We find that, on average, most latent neurons remain silent when fed real music tracks: we call these "noise" neurons. The remaining few dozens of latent neurons that do fire are called "music neurons". We ask which neurons carry the musical information and what kind of musical information they encode, namely something that can be identified as pitch, rhythm or melody. We find that most of the information about pitch and rhythm is encoded in the first few music neurons: the neural network has thus constructed a couple of variables that non-linearly encode many human-defined variables used to describe pitch and rhythm. The concept of melody only seems to show up in independent neurons for longer sequences of music.

**ABSTRACT**  
Expressive text-to-speech systems have undergone significant advancements owing to prosody modeling, but conventional methods can still be improved. Traditional approaches have relied on the autoregressive method to predict the quantized prosody vector; however, it suffers from the issues of long-term dependency and slow inference. This study proposes a novel approach called DiffProsody in which expressive speech is synthesized using a diffusion-based latent prosody generator and prosody conditional adversarial training. Our findings confirm the effectiveness of our prosody generator in generating a prosody vector. Furthermore, our prosody conditional discriminator significantly improves the quality of the generated speech by accurately emulating prosody. We use denoising diffusion generative adversarial networks to improve the prosody generation speed. Consequently, DiffProsody is capable of generating prosody 16 times faster than the conventional diffusion model. The superior performance of our proposed method has been demonstrated via experiments.

**ABSTRACT**  
Automatic music captioning, which generates natural language descriptions for given music tracks, holds significant potential for enhancing the understanding and organization of large volumes of musical data. Despite its importance, researchers face challenges due to the costly and time-consuming collection process of existing music-language datasets, which are limited in size. To address this data scarcity issue, we propose the use of large language models (LLMs) to artificially generate the description sentences from large-scale tag datasets. This results in approximately 2.2M captions paired with 0.5M audio clips. We term it Large Language Model based Pseudo music caption dataset, shortly, LP-MusicCaps. We conduct a systemic evaluation of the large-scale music captioning dataset with various quantitative evaluation metrics used in the field of natural language processing as well as human evaluation. In addition, we trained a transformer-based music captioning model with the dataset and evaluated it under zero-shot and transfer-learning settings. The results demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms the supervised baseline model.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper examines various methods of computing uncertainty and diversity for active learning in genetic programming. We found that the model population in genetic programming can be exploited to select informative training data points by using a model ensemble combined with an uncertainty metric. We explored several uncertainty metrics and found that differential entropy performed the best. We also compared two data diversity metrics and found that correlation as a diversity metric performs better than minimum Euclidean distance, although there are some drawbacks that prevent correlation from being used on all problems. Finally, we combined uncertainty and diversity using a Pareto optimization approach to allow both to be considered in a balanced way to guide the selection of informative and unique data points for training.

**ABSTRACT**  
Digital media have enabled the access to unprecedented literary knowledge. Authors, readers, and scholars are now able to discover and share an increasing amount of information about books and their authors. However, these sources of knowledge are fragmented and do not adequately represent non-Western writers and their works. In this paper we present The World Literature Knowledge Graph, a semantic resource containing 194,346 writers and 965,210 works, specifically designed for exploring facts about literary works and authors from different parts of the world. The knowledge graph integrates information about the reception of literary works gathered from 3 different communities of readers, aligned according to a single semantic model. The resource is accessible through an online visualization platform, which can be found at the following URL: https://literaturegraph.di.unito.it/. This platform has been rigorously tested and validated by $3$ distinct categories of experts who have found it to be highly beneficial for their respective work domains. These categories include teachers, researchers in the humanities, and professionals in the publishing industry. The feedback received from these experts confirms that they can effectively utilize the platform to enhance their work processes and achieve valuable outcomes.

**ABSTRACT**  
We address the problem of integrating data from multiple, possibly biased, observational and interventional studies, to eventually compute counterfactuals in structural causal models. We start from the case of a single observational dataset affected by a selection bias. We show that the likelihood of the available data has no local maxima. This enables us to use the causal expectation-maximisation scheme to approximate the bounds for partially identifiable counterfactual queries, which are the focus of this paper. We then show how the same approach can address the general case of multiple datasets, no matter whether interventional or observational, biased or unbiased, by remapping it into the former one via graphical transformations. Systematic numerical experiments and a case study on palliative care show the effectiveness of our approach, while hinting at the benefits of fusing heterogeneous data sources to get informative outcomes in case of partial identifiability.

**ABSTRACT**  
The performance of worst-case optimal join algorithms depends on the order in which the join attributes are processed. Selecting good orders before query execution is hard, due to the large space of possible orders and unreliable execution cost estimates in case of data skew or data correlation. We propose ADOPT, a query engine that combines adaptive query processing with a worst-case optimal join algorithm, which uses an order on the join attributes instead of a join order on relations. ADOPT divides query execution into episodes in which different attribute orders are tried. Based on run time feedback on attribute order performance, ADOPT converges quickly to near-optimal orders. It avoids redundant work across different orders via a novel data structure, keeping track of parts of the join input that have been successfully processed. It selects attribute orders to try via reinforcement learning, balancing the need for exploring new orders with the desire to exploit promising orders. In experiments with various data sets and queries, it outperforms baselines, including commercial and open-source systems using worst-case optimal join algorithms, whenever queries become complex and therefore difficult to optimize.

**ABSTRACT**  
The advent of large language models marks a revolutionary breakthrough in artificial intelligence. With the unprecedented scale of training and model parameters, the capability of large language models has been dramatically improved, leading to human-like performances in understanding, language synthesizing, and common-sense reasoning, etc. Such a major leap-forward in general AI capacity will change the pattern of how personalization is conducted. For one thing, it will reform the way of interaction between humans and personalization systems. Instead of being a passive medium of information filtering, large language models present the foundation for active user engagement. On top of such a new foundation, user requests can be proactively explored, and user's required information can be delivered in a natural and explainable way. For another thing, it will also considerably expand the scope of personalization, making it grow from the sole function of collecting personalized information to the compound function of providing personalized services. By leveraging large language models as general-purpose interface, the personalization systems may compile user requests into plans, calls the functions of external tools to execute the plans, and integrate the tools' outputs to complete the end-to-end personalization tasks. Today, large language models are still being developed, whereas the application in personalization is largely unexplored. Therefore, we consider it to be the right time to review the challenges in personalization and the opportunities to address them with LLMs. In particular, we dedicate this perspective paper to the discussion of the following aspects: the development and challenges for the existing personalization system, the newly emerged capabilities of large language models, and the potential ways of making use of large language models for personalization.

**ABSTRACT**  
Document understanding and information extraction include different tasks to understand a document and extract valuable information automatically. Recently, there has been a rising demand for developing document understanding among different domains, including business, law, and medicine, to boost the efficiency of work that is associated with a large number of documents. This workshop aims to bring together researchers and industry developers in the field of document intelligence and understanding diverse document types to boost automatic document processing and understanding techniques. We also released a data challenge on the recently introduced document-level VQA dataset, PDFVQA. The PDFVQA challenge examines the structural and contextual understandings of proposed models on the natural full document level of multiple consecutive document pages by including questions with a sequence of answers extracted from multi-pages of the full document. This task helps to boost the document understanding step from the single-page level to the full document level understanding.
