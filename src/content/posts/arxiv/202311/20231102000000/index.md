**ABSTRACT**  
Text classification aims to effectively categorize documents into pre-defined categories. Traditional methods for text classification often rely on large amounts of manually annotated training data, making the process time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this issue, recent studies have focused on weakly-supervised and extremely weakly-supervised settings, which require minimal or no human annotation, respectively. In previous methods of weakly supervised text classification, pseudo-training data is generated by assigning pseudo-labels to documents based on their alignment (e.g., keyword matching) with specific classes. However, these methods ignore the importance of incorporating the explanations of the generated pseudo-labels, or saliency of individual words, as additional guidance during the text classification training process. To address this limitation, we propose XAI-CLASS, a novel explanation-enhanced extremely weakly-supervised text classification method that incorporates word saliency prediction as an auxiliary task. XAI-CLASS begins by employing a multi-round question-answering process to generate pseudo-training data that promotes the mutual enhancement of class labels and corresponding explanation word generation. This pseudo-training data is then used to train a multi-task framework that simultaneously learns both text classification and word saliency prediction. Extensive experiments on several weakly-supervised text classification datasets show that XAI-CLASS outperforms other weakly-supervised text classification methods significantly. Moreover, experiments demonstrate that XAI-CLASS enhances both model performance and explainability.

**ABSTRACT**  
Large Language Models' safety remains a critical concern due to their vulnerability to adversarial attacks, which can prompt these systems to produce harmful responses. In the heart of these systems lies a safety classifier, a computational model trained to discern and mitigate potentially harmful, offensive, or unethical outputs. However, contemporary safety classifiers, despite their potential, often fail when exposed to inputs infused with adversarial noise. In response, our study introduces the Adversarial Prompt Shield (APS), a lightweight model that excels in detection accuracy and demonstrates resilience against adversarial prompts. Additionally, we propose novel strategies for autonomously generating adversarial training datasets, named Bot Adversarial Noisy Dialogue (BAND) datasets. These datasets are designed to fortify the safety classifier's robustness, and we investigate the consequences of incorporating adversarial examples into the training process. Through evaluations involving Large Language Models, we demonstrate that our classifier has the potential to decrease the attack success rate resulting from adversarial attacks by up to 60%. This advancement paves the way for the next generation of more reliable and resilient conversational agents.

**ABSTRACT**  
Counterspeech, i.e., responses to counteract potential harms of hateful speech, has become an increasingly popular solution to address online hate speech without censorship. However, properly countering hateful language requires countering and dispelling the underlying inaccurate stereotypes implied by such language. In this work, we draw from psychology and philosophy literature to craft six psychologically inspired strategies to challenge the underlying stereotypical implications of hateful language. We first examine the convincingness of each of these strategies through a user study, and then compare their usages in both human- and machine-generated counterspeech datasets. Our results show that human-written counterspeech uses countering strategies that are more specific to the implied stereotype (e.g., counter examples to the stereotype, external factors about the stereotype's origins), whereas machine-generated counterspeech uses less specific strategies (e.g., generally denouncing the hatefulness of speech). Furthermore, machine-generated counterspeech often employs strategies that humans deem less convincing compared to human-produced counterspeech. Our findings point to the importance of accounting for the underlying stereotypical implications of speech when generating counterspeech and for better machine reasoning about anti-stereotypical examples.

**ABSTRACT**  
This work explores the degree to which grammar acquisition is driven by language `simplicity' and the source modality (speech vs. text) of data. Using BabyBERTa as a probe, we find that grammar acquisition is largely driven by exposure to speech data, and in particular through exposure to two of the BabyLM training corpora: AO-Childes and Open Subtitles. We arrive at this finding by examining various ways of presenting input data to our model. First, we assess the impact of various sequence-level complexity based curricula. We then examine the impact of learning over `blocks' -- covering spans of text that are balanced for the number of tokens in each of the source corpora (rather than number of lines). Finally, we explore curricula that vary the degree to which the model is exposed to different corpora. In all cases, we find that over-exposure to AO-Childes and Open Subtitles significantly drives performance. We verify these findings through a comparable control dataset in which exposure to these corpora, and speech more generally, is limited by design. Our findings indicate that it is not the proportion of tokens occupied by high-utility data that aids acquisition, but rather the proportion of training steps assigned to such data. We hope this encourages future research into the use of more developmentally plausible linguistic data (which tends to be more scarce) to augment general purpose pre-training regimes.

**ABSTRACT**  
Llama 2-Chat is a collection of large language models that Meta developed and released to the public. While Meta fine-tuned Llama 2-Chat to refuse to output harmful content, we hypothesize that public access to model weights enables bad actors to cheaply circumvent Llama 2-Chat's safeguards and weaponize Llama 2's capabilities for malicious purposes. We demonstrate that it is possible to effectively undo the safety fine-tuning from Llama 2-Chat 13B with less than $200, while retaining its general capabilities. Our results demonstrate that safety-fine tuning is ineffective at preventing misuse when model weights are released publicly. Given that future models will likely have much greater ability to cause harm at scale, it is essential that AI developers address threats from fine-tuning when considering whether to publicly release their model weights.

**ABSTRACT**  
Real-world NLP applications often deal with nonstandard text (e.g., dialectal, informal, or misspelled text). However, language models like BERT deteriorate in the face of dialect variation or noise. How do we push BERT's modeling capabilities to encompass nonstandard text? Fine-tuning helps, but it is designed for specializing a model to a task and does not seem to bring about the deeper, more pervasive changes needed to adapt a model to nonstandard language. In this paper, we introduce the novel idea of sandwiching BERT's encoder stack between additional encoder layers trained to perform masked language modeling on noisy text. We find that our approach, paired with recent work on including character-level noise in fine-tuning data, can promote zero-shot transfer to dialectal text, as well as reduce the distance in the embedding space between words and their noisy counterparts.

**ABSTRACT**  
Large text corpora are the backbone of language models. However, we have a limited understanding of the content of these corpora, including general statistics, quality, social factors, and inclusion of evaluation data (contamination). In this work, we propose What's In My Big Data? (WIMBD), a platform and a set of sixteen analyses that allow us to reveal and compare the contents of large text corpora. WIMBD builds on two basic capabilities -- count and search -- at scale, which allows us to analyze more than 35 terabytes on a standard compute node. We apply WIMBD to ten different corpora used to train popular language models, including C4, The Pile, and RedPajama. Our analysis uncovers several surprising and previously undocumented findings about these corpora, including the high prevalence of duplicate, synthetic, and low-quality content, personally identifiable information, toxic language, and benchmark contamination. For instance, we find that about 50% of the documents in RedPajama and LAION-2B-en are duplicates. In addition, several datasets used for benchmarking models trained on such corpora are contaminated with respect to important benchmarks, including the Winograd Schema Challenge and parts of GLUE and SuperGLUE. We open-source WIMBD's code and artifacts to provide a standard set of evaluations for new text-based corpora and to encourage more analyses and transparency around them: github.com/allenai/wimbd.

**ABSTRACT**  
Large language models (LLMs) recently exhibited remarkable reasoning capabilities on solving math problems. To further improve this capability, this work proposes Learning from Mistakes (LeMa), akin to human learning processes. Consider a human student who failed to solve a math problem, he will learn from what mistake he has made and how to correct it. Mimicking this error-driven learning process, LeMa fine-tunes LLMs on mistake-correction data pairs generated by GPT-4. Specifically, we first collect inaccurate reasoning paths from various LLMs and then employ GPT-4 as a "corrector" to (1) identify the mistake step, (2) explain the reason for the mistake, and (3) correct the mistake and generate the final answer. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of LeMa: across five backbone LLMs and two mathematical reasoning tasks, LeMa consistently improves the performance compared with fine-tuning on CoT data alone. Impressively, LeMa can also benefit specialized LLMs such as WizardMath and MetaMath, achieving 85.4% pass@1 accuracy on GSM8K and 27.1% on MATH. This surpasses the SOTA performance achieved by non-execution open-source models on these challenging tasks. Our code, data and models will be publicly available at https://github.com/microsoft/CodeT.

**ABSTRACT**  
When natural language phrases are combined, their meaning is often more than the sum of their parts. In the context of NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis, where the meaning of a phrase is its sentiment, that still applies. Many NLP studies on sentiment analysis, however, focus on the fact that sentiment computations are largely compositional. We, instead, set out to obtain non-compositionality ratings for phrases with respect to their sentiment. Our contributions are as follows: a) a methodology for obtaining those non-compositionality ratings, b) a resource of ratings for 259 phrases -- NonCompSST -- along with an analysis of that resource, and c) an evaluation of computational models for sentiment analysis using this new resource.

**ABSTRACT**  
The recent explosion of performance of large language models (LLMs) has changed the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) more abruptly and seismically than any other shift in the field's 80-year history. This has resulted in concerns that the field will become homogenized and resource-intensive. The new status quo has put many academic researchers, especially PhD students, at a disadvantage. This paper aims to define a new NLP playground by proposing 20+ PhD-dissertation-worthy research directions, covering theoretical analysis, new and challenging problems, learning paradigms, and interdisciplinary applications.

**ABSTRACT**  
Continuous-output neural machine translation (CoNMT) replaces the discrete next-word prediction problem with an embedding prediction. The semantic structure of the target embedding space (i.e., closeness of related words) is intuitively believed to be crucial. We challenge this assumption and show that completely random output embeddings can outperform laboriously pretrained ones, especially on larger datasets. Further investigation shows this surprising effect is strongest for rare words, due to the geometry of their embeddings. We shed further light on this finding by designing a mixed strategy that combines random and pre-trained embeddings for different tokens.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this paper, we describe our submission to the BabyLM Challenge 2023 shared task on data-efficient language model (LM) pretraining (Warstadt et al., 2023). We train transformer-based masked language models that incorporate unsupervised predictions about hierarchical sentence structure into the model architecture. Concretely, we use the Structformer architecture (Shen et al., 2021) and variants thereof. StructFormer models have been shown to perform well on unsupervised syntactic induction based on limited pretraining data, and to yield performance improvements over a vanilla transformer architecture (Shen et al., 2021). Evaluation of our models on 39 tasks provided by the BabyLM challenge shows promising improvements of models that integrate a hierarchical bias into the architecture at some particular tasks, even though they fail to consistently outperform the RoBERTa baseline model provided by the shared task organizers on all tasks.

**ABSTRACT**  
In the era of the Internet of Things (IoT), the retrieval of relevant medical information has become essential for efficient clinical decision-making. This paper introduces MedFusionRank, a novel approach to zero-shot medical information retrieval (MIR) that combines the strengths of pre-trained language models and statistical methods while addressing their limitations. The proposed approach leverages a pre-trained BERT-style model to extract compact yet informative keywords. These keywords are then enriched with domain knowledge by linking them to conceptual entities within a medical knowledge graph. Experimental evaluations on medical datasets demonstrate MedFusion Rank's superior performance over existing methods, with promising results with a variety of evaluation metrics. MedFusionRank demonstrates efficacy in retrieving relevant information, even from short or single-term queries.

**ABSTRACT**  
Transformer-based models, specifically BERT, have propelled research in various NLP tasks. However, these models are limited to a maximum token limit of 512 tokens. Consequently, this makes it non-trivial to apply it in a practical setting with long input. Various complex methods have claimed to overcome this limit, but recent research questions the efficacy of these models across different classification tasks. These complex architectures evaluated on carefully curated long datasets perform at par or worse than simple baselines. In this work, we propose a relatively simple extension to vanilla BERT architecture called ChunkBERT that allows finetuning of any pretrained models to perform inference on arbitrarily long text. The proposed method is based on chunking token representations and CNN layers, making it compatible with any pre-trained BERT. We evaluate chunkBERT exclusively on a benchmark for comparing long-text classification models across a variety of tasks (including binary classification, multi-class classification, and multi-label classification). A BERT model finetuned using the ChunkBERT method performs consistently across long samples in the benchmark while utilizing only a fraction (6.25\%) of the original memory footprint. These findings suggest that efficient finetuning and inference can be achieved through simple modifications to pre-trained BERT models.

**ABSTRACT**  
The automatic evaluation of LLM-based agent intelligence is critical in developing advanced LLM-based agents. Although considerable effort has been devoted to developing human-annotated evaluation datasets, such as AlpacaEval, existing techniques are costly, time-consuming, and lack adaptability. In this paper, inspired by the popular language game ``Who is Spy'', we propose to use the word guessing game to assess the intelligence performance of LLMs. Given a word, the LLM is asked to describe the word and determine its identity (spy or not) based on its and other players' descriptions. Ideally, an advanced agent should possess the ability to accurately describe a given word using an aggressive description while concurrently maximizing confusion in the conservative description, enhancing its participation in the game. To this end, we first develop DEEP to evaluate LLMs' expression and disguising abilities. DEEP requires LLM to describe a word in aggressive and conservative modes. We then introduce SpyGame, an interactive multi-agent framework designed to assess LLMs' intelligence through participation in a competitive language-based board game. Incorporating multi-agent interaction, SpyGame requires the target LLM to possess linguistic skills and strategic thinking, providing a more comprehensive evaluation of LLMs' human-like cognitive abilities and adaptability in complex communication situations. The proposed evaluation framework is very easy to implement. We collected words from multiple sources, domains, and languages and used the proposed evaluation framework to conduct experiments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed DEEP and SpyGame effectively evaluate the capabilities of various LLMs, capturing their ability to adapt to novel situations and engage in strategic communication.

**ABSTRACT**  
While most task-oriented dialogues assume conversations between the agent and one user at a time, dialogue systems are increasingly expected to communicate with multiple users simultaneously who make decisions collaboratively. To facilitate development of such systems, we release the Multi-User MultiWOZ dataset: task-oriented dialogues among two users and one agent. To collect this dataset, each user utterance from MultiWOZ 2.2 was replaced with a small chat between two users that is semantically and pragmatically consistent with the original user utterance, thus resulting in the same dialogue state and system response. These dialogues reflect interesting dynamics of collaborative decision-making in task-oriented scenarios, e.g., social chatter and deliberation. Supported by this data, we propose the novel task of multi-user contextual query rewriting: to rewrite a task-oriented chat between two users as a concise task-oriented query that retains only task-relevant information and that is directly consumable by the dialogue system. We demonstrate that in multi-user dialogues, using predicted rewrites substantially improves dialogue state tracking without modifying existing dialogue systems that are trained for single-user dialogues. Further, this method surpasses training a medium-sized model directly on multi-user dialogues and generalizes to unseen domains.

**ABSTRACT**  
Multilingualism is widespread around the world and code-switching (CSW) is a common practice among different language pairs/tuples across locations and regions. However, there is still not much progress in building successful CSW systems, despite the recent advances in Massive Multilingual Language Models (MMLMs). We investigate the reasons behind this setback through a critical study about the existing CSW data sets (68) across language pairs in terms of the collection and preparation (e.g. transcription and annotation) stages. This in-depth analysis reveals that \textbf{a)} most CSW data involves English ignoring other language pairs/tuples \textbf{b)} there are flaws in terms of representativeness in data collection and preparation stages due to ignoring the location based, socio-demographic and register variation in CSW. In addition, lack of clarity on the data selection and filtering stages shadow the representativeness of CSW data sets. We conclude by providing a short check-list to improve the representativeness for forthcoming studies involving CSW data collection and preparation.

**ABSTRACT**  
The ACL Anthology is an online repository that serves as a comprehensive collection of publications in the field of natural language processing (NLP) and computational linguistics (CL). This paper presents a tool called ``ACL Anthology Helper''. It automates the process of parsing and downloading papers along with their meta-information, which are then stored in a local MySQL database. This allows for efficient management of the local papers using a wide range of operations, including "where," "group," "order," and more. By providing over 20 operations, this tool significantly enhances the retrieval of literature based on specific conditions. Notably, this tool has been successfully utilised in writing a survey paper (Tang et al.,2022a). By introducing the ACL Anthology Helper, we aim to enhance researchers' ability to effectively access and organise literature from the ACL Anthology. This tool offers a convenient solution for researchers seeking to explore the ACL Anthology's vast collection of publications while allowing for more targeted and efficient literature retrieval.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this paper, we employ Singular Value Canonical Correlation Analysis (SVCCA) to analyze representations learnt in a multilingual end-to-end speech translation model trained over 22 languages. SVCCA enables us to estimate representational similarity across languages and layers, enhancing our understanding of the functionality of multilingual speech translation and its potential connection to multilingual neural machine translation. The multilingual speech translation model is trained on the CoVoST 2 dataset in all possible directions, and we utilize LASER to extract parallel bitext data for SVCCA analysis. We derive three major findings from our analysis: (I) Linguistic similarity loses its efficacy in multilingual speech translation when the training data for a specific language is limited. (II) Enhanced encoder representations and well-aligned audio-text data significantly improve translation quality, surpassing the bilingual counterparts when the training data is not compromised. (III) The encoder representations of multilingual speech translation demonstrate superior performance in predicting phonetic features in linguistic typology prediction. With these findings, we propose that releasing the constraint of limited data for low-resource languages and subsequently combining them with linguistically related high-resource languages could offer a more effective approach for multilingual end-to-end speech translation.

**ABSTRACT**  
Introduction: The scientific publishing landscape is expanding rapidly, creating challenges for researchers to stay up-to-date with the evolution of the literature. Natural Language Processing (NLP) has emerged as a potent approach to automating knowledge extraction from this vast amount of publications and preprints. Tasks such as Named-Entity Recognition (NER) and Named-Entity Linking (NEL), in conjunction with context-dependent semantic interpretation, offer promising and complementary approaches to extracting structured information and revealing key concepts.   Results: We present the SourceData-NLP dataset produced through the routine curation of papers during the publication process. A unique feature of this dataset is its emphasis on the annotation of bioentities in figure legends. We annotate eight classes of biomedical entities (small molecules, gene products, subcellular components, cell lines, cell types, tissues, organisms, and diseases), their role in the experimental design, and the nature of the experimental method as an additional class. SourceData-NLP contains more than 620,000 annotated biomedical entities, curated from 18,689 figures in 3,223 papers in molecular and cell biology. We illustrate the dataset's usefulness by assessing BioLinkBERT and PubmedBERT, two transformers-based models, fine-tuned on the SourceData-NLP dataset for NER. We also introduce a novel context-dependent semantic task that infers whether an entity is the target of a controlled intervention or the object of measurement.   Conclusions: SourceData-NLP's scale highlights the value of integrating curation into publishing. Models trained with SourceData-NLP will furthermore enable the development of tools able to extract causal hypotheses from the literature and assemble them into knowledge graphs.

**ABSTRACT**  
The ability to follow instructions is crucial to Large Language Models (LLMs) to handle various real-world applications. Existing benchmarks primarily focus on evaluating superficial response quality, which does not necessarily indicate instruction-following capability. To fill this research gap, in this paper, we propose FollowBench, a Multi-level Fine-grained Constraints Following Benchmark for LLMs. FollowBench comprehensively includes five different types (i.e., Content, Scenario, Style, Format, and Example) of fine-grained constraints. To enable a precise constraint following estimation, we introduce a Multi-level mechanism that incrementally adds a single constraint to the initial instruction at each level. To evaluate whether LLMs' outputs have satisfied every individual constraint, we propose to prompt strong LLMs with constraint evolution paths to handle challenging semantic constraints. By evaluating nine closed-source and open-source popular LLMs on FollowBench, we highlight the weaknesses of LLMs in instruction following and point towards potential avenues for future work. The data and code are publicly available at https://github.com/YJiangcm/FollowBench.

**ABSTRACT**  
Analogy-making lies at the heart of human cognition. Adults solve analogies such as \textit{Horse belongs to stable like chicken belongs to ...?} by mapping relations (\textit{kept in}) and answering \textit{chicken coop}. In contrast, children often use association, e.g., answering \textit{egg}. This paper investigates whether large language models (LLMs) solve verbal analogies in A:B::C:? form using associations, similar to what children do. We use verbal analogies extracted from an online adaptive learning environment, where 14,002 7-12 year-olds from the Netherlands solved 622 analogies in Dutch. The six tested Dutch monolingual and multilingual LLMs performed around the same level as children, with MGPT performing worst, around the 7-year-old level, and XLM-V and GPT-3 the best, slightly above the 11-year-old level. However, when we control for associative processes this picture changes and each model's performance level drops 1-2 years. Further experiments demonstrate that associative processes often underlie correctly solved analogies. We conclude that the LLMs we tested indeed tend to solve verbal analogies by association with C like children do.

**ABSTRACT**  
Code editing encompasses a variety of pragmatic tasks that developers deal with daily. Despite its relevance and practical usefulness, automatic code editing remains an underexplored area in the evolution of deep learning models, partly due to data scarcity. In this work, we explore the use of large language models (LLMs) to edit code based on user instructions, covering a broad range of implicit tasks such as comment insertion, code optimization, and code refactoring. To facilitate this, we introduce InstructCoder, the first dataset designed to adapt LLMs for general-purpose code editing, containing highdiversity code-editing tasks. It consists of over 114,000 instruction-input-output triplets and covers multiple distinct code editing scenarios. The dataset is systematically expanded through an iterative process that commences with code editing data sourced from GitHub commits as seed tasks. Seed and generated tasks are used subsequently to prompt ChatGPT for more task data. Our experiments demonstrate that open-source LLMs fine-tuned on InstructCoder can edit code correctly based on users' instructions most of the time, exhibiting unprecedented code-editing performance levels. Such results suggest that proficient instruction-finetuning can lead to significant amelioration in code editing abilities. The dataset and the source code are available at https://github.com/qishenghu/CodeInstruct.

**ABSTRACT**  
To what degree should we ascribe cognitive capacities to Large Language Models (LLMs), such as the ability to reason about intentions and beliefs known as Theory of Mind (ToM)? Here we add to this emerging debate by (i) testing 11 base- and instruction-tuned LLMs on capabilities relevant to ToM beyond the dominant false-belief paradigm, including non-literal language usage and recursive intentionality; (ii) using newly rewritten versions of standardized tests to gauge LLMs' robustness; (iii) prompting and scoring for open besides closed questions; and (iv) benchmarking LLM performance against that of children aged 7-10 on the same tasks. We find that instruction-tuned LLMs from the GPT family outperform other models, and often also children. Base-LLMs are mostly unable to solve ToM tasks, even with specialized prompting. We suggest that the interlinked evolution and development of language and ToM may help explain what instruction-tuning adds: rewarding cooperative communication that takes into account interlocutor and context. We conclude by arguing for a nuanced perspective on ToM in LLMs.

**ABSTRACT**  
Learning chess strategies has been investigated widely, with most studies focussing on learning from previous games using search algorithms. Chess textbooks encapsulate grandmaster knowledge, explain playing strategies and require a smaller search space compared to traditional chess agents. This paper examines chess textbooks as a new knowledge source for enabling machines to learn how to play chess -- a resource that has not been explored previously. We developed the LEAP corpus, a first and new heterogeneous dataset with structured (chess move notations and board states) and unstructured data (textual descriptions) collected from a chess textbook containing 1164 sentences discussing strategic moves from 91 games. We firstly labelled the sentences based on their relevance, i.e., whether they are discussing a move. Each relevant sentence was then labelled according to its sentiment towards the described move. We performed empirical experiments that assess the performance of various transformer-based baseline models for sentiment analysis. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of employing transformer-based sentiment analysis models for evaluating chess moves, with the best performing model obtaining a weighted micro F_1 score of 68%. Finally, we synthesised the LEAP corpus to create a larger dataset, which can be used as a solution to the limited textual resource in the chess domain.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recent advances in large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, have showcased remarkable zero-shot performance across various NLP tasks. However, the potential of LLMs in personality detection, which involves identifying an individual's personality from their written texts, remains largely unexplored. Drawing inspiration from Psychological Questionnaires, which are carefully designed by psychologists to evaluate individual personality traits through a series of targeted items, we argue that these items can be regarded as a collection of well-structured chain-of-thought (CoT) processes. By incorporating these processes, LLMs can enhance their capabilities to make more reasonable inferences on personality from textual input. In light of this, we propose a novel personality detection method, called PsyCoT, which mimics the way individuals complete psychological questionnaires in a multi-turn dialogue manner. In particular, we employ a LLM as an AI assistant with a specialization in text analysis. We prompt the assistant to rate individual items at each turn and leverage the historical rating results to derive a conclusive personality preference. Our experiments demonstrate that PsyCoT significantly improves the performance and robustness of GPT-3.5 in personality detection, achieving an average F1 score improvement of 4.23/10.63 points on two benchmark datasets compared to the standard prompting method. Our code is available at https://github.com/TaoYang225/PsyCoT.

**ABSTRACT**  
Existing research predominantly focuses on developing powerful language learning models (LLMs) for mathematical reasoning within monolingual languages, with few explorations in preserving efficacy in a multilingual context. To bridge this gap, this paper pioneers exploring and training powerful Multilingual Math Reasoning (xMR) LLMs. Firstly, by utilizing translation, we construct the first multilingual math reasoning instruction dataset, MGSM8KInstruct, encompassing ten distinct languages, thus addressing the issue of training data scarcity in xMR tasks. Based on the collected dataset, we propose different training strategies to build powerful xMR LLMs, named MathOctopus, notably outperform conventional open-source LLMs and exhibit superiority over ChatGPT in few-shot scenarios. Notably, MathOctopus-13B reaches 47.6% accuracy which exceeds ChatGPT 46.3% on MGSM testset. Beyond remarkable results, we unearth several pivotal observations and insights from extensive experiments: (1) When extending the rejection sampling strategy to the multilingual context, it proves effective for model performances, albeit limited. (2) Employing parallel corpora for math Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) across multiple languages not only significantly enhances model performance multilingually but also elevates their monolingual performance. This indicates that crafting multilingual corpora can be regarded as a vital strategy for enhancing model performance in a specific language, especially in mathematical reasoning tasks. For instance, MathOctopus-7B improves its counterparts that trained on English from 42.2% to 50.8% on GSM8K testset.

**ABSTRACT**  
Existing multimodal machine translation (MMT) datasets consist of images and video captions or instructional video subtitles, which rarely contain linguistic ambiguity, making visual information ineffective in generating appropriate translations. Recent work has constructed an ambiguous subtitles dataset to alleviate this problem but is still limited to the problem that videos do not necessarily contribute to disambiguation. We introduce EVA (Extensive training set and Video-helpful evaluation set for Ambiguous subtitles translation), an MMT dataset containing 852k Japanese-English (Ja-En) parallel subtitle pairs, 520k Chinese-English (Zh-En) parallel subtitle pairs, and corresponding video clips collected from movies and TV episodes. In addition to the extensive training set, EVA contains a video-helpful evaluation set in which subtitles are ambiguous, and videos are guaranteed helpful for disambiguation. Furthermore, we propose SAFA, an MMT model based on the Selective Attention model with two novel methods: Frame attention loss and Ambiguity augmentation, aiming to use videos in EVA for disambiguation fully. Experiments on EVA show that visual information and the proposed methods can boost translation performance, and our model performs significantly better than existing MMT models. The EVA dataset and the SAFA model are available at: https://github.com/ku-nlp/video-helpful-MMT.git.

**ABSTRACT**  
The ability to process idiomatic or literal multiword expressions is a crucial aspect of understanding and generating any language. The task of generating contextually relevant continuations for narratives containing idiomatic (or literal) expressions can allow us to test the ability of generative language models (LMs) in understanding nuanced language containing non-compositional figurative text. We conduct a series of experiments using datasets in two distinct languages (English and Portuguese) under three different training settings (zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuned). Our results suggest that the models are only slightly better at generating continuations for literal contexts than idiomatic contexts, with exceedingly small margins. Furthermore, the models studied in this work perform equally well across both languages, indicating the robustness of generative models in performing this task.

**ABSTRACT**  
Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive generation capabilities, but they suffer from hallucinations when solely relying on their internal knowledge, especially when answering questions that require less commonly known information. Retrieval-augmented LLMs have emerged as a potential solution to ground LLMs in external knowledge. Nonetheless, recent approaches have primarily emphasized retrieval from unstructured text corpora, owing to its seamless integration into prompts. When using structured data such as knowledge graphs, most methods simplify it into natural text, neglecting the underlying structures. Moreover, a significant gap in the current landscape is the absence of a realistic benchmark for evaluating the effectiveness of grounding LLMs on heterogeneous knowledge sources (e.g., knowledge base and text). To fill this gap, we have curated a comprehensive dataset that poses two unique challenges: (1) Two-hop multi-source questions that require retrieving information from both open-domain structured and unstructured knowledge sources; retrieving information from structured knowledge sources is a critical component in correctly answering the questions. (2) The generation of symbolic queries (e.g., SPARQL for Wikidata) is a key requirement, which adds another layer of challenge. Our dataset is created using a combination of automatic generation through predefined reasoning chains and human annotation. We also introduce a novel approach that leverages multiple retrieval tools, including text passage retrieval and symbolic language-assisted retrieval. Our model outperforms previous approaches by a significant margin, demonstrating its effectiveness in addressing the above-mentioned reasoning challenges.

**ABSTRACT**  
Given a query and a document corpus, the information retrieval (IR) task is to output a ranked list of relevant documents. Combining large language models (LLMs) with embedding-based retrieval models, recent work shows promising results on the zero-shot retrieval problem, i.e., no access to labeled data from the target domain. Two such popular paradigms are generation-augmented retrieval or GAR (generate additional context for the query and then retrieve), and retrieval-augmented generation or RAG (retrieve relevant documents as context and then generate answers). The success of these paradigms hinges on (i) high-recall retrieval models, which are difficult to obtain in the zero-shot setting, and (ii) high-precision (re-)ranking models which typically need a good initialization. In this work, we propose a novel GAR-meets-RAG recurrence formulation that overcomes the challenges of existing paradigms. Our method iteratively improves retrieval (via GAR) and rewrite (via RAG) stages in the zero-shot setting. A key design principle is that the rewrite-retrieval stages improve the recall of the system and a final re-ranking stage improves the precision. We conduct extensive experiments on zero-shot passage retrieval benchmarks, BEIR and TREC-DL. Our method establishes a new state-of-the-art in the BEIR benchmark, outperforming previous best results in Recall@100 and nDCG@10 metrics on 6 out of 8 datasets, with up to 17% relative gains over the previous best.

**ABSTRACT**  
Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various tasks. However, their suitability for domain-specific tasks, is limited due to their immense scale at deployment, susceptibility to misinformation, and more importantly, high data annotation costs. We propose a novel Interactive Multi-Fidelity Learning (IMFL) framework for the cost-effective development of small domain-specific LMs under limited annotation budgets. Our approach formulates the domain-specific fine-tuning process as a multi-fidelity learning problem, focusing on identifying the optimal acquisition strategy that balances between low-fidelity automatic LLM annotations and high-fidelity human annotations to maximize model performance. We further propose an exploration-exploitation query strategy that enhances annotation diversity and informativeness, incorporating two innovative designs: 1) prompt retrieval that selects in-context examples from human-annotated samples to improve LLM annotation, and 2) variable batch size that controls the order for choosing each fidelity to facilitate knowledge distillation, ultimately enhancing annotation quality. Extensive experiments on financial and medical tasks demonstrate that IMFL achieves superior performance compared with single fidelity annotations. Given a limited budget of human annotation, IMFL significantly outperforms the human annotation baselines in all four tasks and achieves very close performance as human annotations on two of the tasks. These promising results suggest that the high human annotation costs in domain-specific tasks can be significantly reduced by employing IMFL, which utilizes fewer human annotations, supplemented with cheaper and faster LLM (e.g., GPT-3.5) annotations to achieve comparable performance.

**ABSTRACT**  
Multi-agent systems driven by large language models (LLMs) have shown promising abilities for solving complex tasks in a collaborative manner. This work considers a fundamental problem in multi-agent collaboration: consensus seeking. When multiple agents work together, we are interested in how they can reach a consensus through inter-agent negotiation. To that end, this work studies a consensus-seeking task where the state of each agent is a numerical value and they negotiate with each other to reach a consensus value. It is revealed that when not explicitly directed on which strategy should be adopted, the LLM-driven agents primarily use the average strategy for consensus seeking although they may occasionally use some other strategies. Moreover, this work analyzes the impact of the agent number, agent personality, and network topology on the negotiation process. The findings reported in this work can potentially lay the foundations for understanding the behaviors of LLM-driven multi-agent systems for solving more complex tasks. Furthermore, LLM-driven consensus seeking is applied to a multi-robot aggregation task. This application demonstrates the potential of LLM-driven agents to achieve zero-shot autonomous planning for multi-robot collaboration tasks.

**ABSTRACT**  
We introduce EELBERT, an approach for compression of transformer-based models (e.g., BERT), with minimal impact on the accuracy of downstream tasks. This is achieved by replacing the input embedding layer of the model with dynamic, i.e. on-the-fly, embedding computations. Since the input embedding layer accounts for a significant fraction of the model size, especially for the smaller BERT variants, replacing this layer with an embedding computation function helps us reduce the model size significantly. Empirical evaluation on the GLUE benchmark shows that our BERT variants (EELBERT) suffer minimal regression compared to the traditional BERT models. Through this approach, we are able to develop our smallest model UNO-EELBERT, which achieves a GLUE score within 4% of fully trained BERT-tiny, while being 15x smaller (1.2 MB) in size.

**ABSTRACT**  
We employ a characterization of linguistic complexity from psycholinguistic and language acquisition research to develop data-driven curricula to understand the underlying linguistic knowledge that models learn to address NLP tasks. The novelty of our approach is in the development of linguistic curricula derived from data, existing knowledge about linguistic complexity, and model behavior during training. By analyzing several benchmark NLP datasets, our curriculum learning approaches identify sets of linguistic metrics (indices) that inform the challenges and reasoning required to address each task. Our work will inform future research in all NLP areas, allowing linguistic complexity to be considered early in the research and development process. In addition, our work prompts an examination of gold standards and fair evaluation in NLP.

**ABSTRACT**  
Although large language models (LLMs) have advanced the state-of-the-art in NLP significantly, deploying them for downstream applications is still challenging due to cost, responsiveness, control, or concerns around privacy and security. As such, trainable models are still the preferred option in some cases. However, these models still require human-labeled data for optimal performance, which is expensive and time-consuming to obtain. In order to address this issue, several techniques to reduce human effort involve labeling or generating data using LLMs. Although these methods are effective for certain applications, in practice they encounter difficulties in real-world scenarios. Labeling data requires careful data selection, while generating data necessitates task-specific prompt engineering. In this paper, we propose a unified data creation pipeline that requires only a single formatting example, and which is applicable to a broad range of tasks, including traditionally problematic ones with semantically devoid label spaces. In our experiments we demonstrate that instruction-following LLMs are highly cost-effective data creators, and that models trained with these data exhibit performance better than those trained with human-labeled data (by up to 17.5%) on out-of-distribution evaluation, while maintaining comparable performance on in-distribution tasks. These results have important implications for the robustness of NLP systems deployed in the real-world.

**ABSTRACT**  
The success of neural language models (LMs) on many technological tasks has brought about their potential relevance as scientific theories of language despite some clear differences between LM training and child language acquisition. In this paper we argue that some of the most prominent benchmarks for evaluating the syntactic capacities of LMs may not be sufficiently rigorous. In particular, we show that the template-based benchmarks lack the structural diversity commonly found in the theoretical and psychological studies of language. When trained on small-scale data modeling child language acquisition, the LMs can be readily matched by simple baseline models. We advocate for the use of the readily available, carefully curated datasets that have been evaluated for gradient acceptability by large pools of native speakers and are designed to probe the structural basis of grammar specifically. On one such dataset, the LI-Adger dataset, LMs evaluate sentences in a way inconsistent with human language users. We conclude with suggestions for better connecting LMs with the empirical study of child language acquisition.

**ABSTRACT**  
Clinical note classification is a common clinical NLP task. However, annotated data-sets are scarse. Prompt-based learning has recently emerged as an effective method to adapt pre-trained models for text classification using only few training examples. A critical component of prompt design is the definition of the template (i.e. prompt text). The effect of template position, however, has been insufficiently investigated. This seems particularly important in the clinical setting, where task-relevant information is usually sparse in clinical notes. In this study we develop a keyword-optimized template insertion method (KOTI) and show how optimizing position can improve performance on several clinical tasks in a zero-shot and few-shot training setting.

**ABSTRACT**  
Large-scale astronomical surveys can capture numerous images of celestial objects, including galaxies and nebulae. Analysing and processing these images can reveal intricate internal structures of these objects, allowing researchers to conduct comprehensive studies on their morphology, evolution, and physical properties. However, varying noise levels and point spread functions can hamper the accuracy and efficiency of information extraction from these images. To mitigate these effects, we propose a novel image restoration algorithm that connects a deep learning-based restoration algorithm with a high-fidelity telescope simulator. During the training stage, the simulator generates images with different levels of blur and noise to train the neural network based on the quality of restored images. After training, the neural network can directly restore images obtained by the telescope, as represented by the simulator. We have tested the algorithm using real and simulated observation data and have found that it effectively enhances fine structures in blurry images and increases the quality of observation images. This algorithm can be applied to large-scale sky survey data, such as data obtained by LSST, Euclid, and CSST, to further improve the accuracy and efficiency of information extraction, promoting advances in the field of astronomical research.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper focuses on building object-centric representations for long-term action anticipation in videos. Our key motivation is that objects provide important cues to recognize and predict human-object interactions, especially when the predictions are longer term, as an observed "background" object could be used by the human actor in the future. We observe that existing object-based video recognition frameworks either assume the existence of in-domain supervised object detectors or follow a fully weakly-supervised pipeline to infer object locations from action labels. We propose to build object-centric video representations by leveraging visual-language pretrained models. This is achieved by "object prompts", an approach to extract task-specific object-centric representations from general-purpose pretrained models without finetuning. To recognize and predict human-object interactions, we use a Transformer-based neural architecture which allows the "retrieval" of relevant objects for action anticipation at various time scales. We conduct extensive evaluations on the Ego4D, 50Salads, and EGTEA Gaze+ benchmarks. Both quantitative and qualitative results confirm the effectiveness of our proposed method.

**ABSTRACT**  
Multi-task approaches to joint depth and segmentation prediction are well-studied for monocular images. Yet, predictions from a single-view are inherently limited, while multiple views are available in many robotics applications. On the other end of the spectrum, video-based and full 3D methods require numerous frames to perform reconstruction and segmentation. With this work we propose a Multi-View Stereo (MVS) technique for depth prediction that benefits from rich semantic features of the Segment Anything Model (SAM). This enhanced depth prediction, in turn, serves as a prompt to our Transformer-based semantic segmentation decoder. We report the mutual benefit that both tasks enjoy in our quantitative and qualitative studies on the ScanNet dataset. Our approach consistently outperforms single-task MVS and segmentation models, along with multi-task monocular methods.

**ABSTRACT**  
Deep neural networks have exhibited remarkable performance in various domains. However, the reliance of these models on spurious features has raised concerns about their reliability. A promising solution to this problem is last-layer retraining, which involves retraining the linear classifier head on a small subset of data without spurious cues. Nevertheless, selecting this subset requires human supervision, which reduces its scalability. Moreover, spurious cues may still exist in the selected subset. As a solution to this problem, we propose a novel ranking framework that leverages an open vocabulary object detection technique to identify images without spurious cues. More specifically, we use the object detector as a measure to score the presence of the target object in the images. Next, the images are sorted based on this score, and the last-layer of the model is retrained on a subset of the data with the highest scores. Our experiments on the ImageNet-1k dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of this ranking framework in sorting images based on spuriousness and using them for last-layer retraining.

**ABSTRACT**  
Echocardiography provides an important tool for clinicians to observe the function of the heart in real time, at low cost, and without harmful radiation. Automated localization and classification of heart valves enables automatic extraction of quantities associated with heart mechanical function and related blood flow measurements. We propose a machine learning pipeline that uses deep neural networks for separate classification and localization steps. As the first step in the pipeline, we apply view classification to echocardiograms with ten unique anatomic views of the heart. In the second step, we apply deep learning-based object detection to both localize and identify the valves. Image segmentation based object detection in echocardiography has been shown in many earlier studies but, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that predicts the bounding boxes around the valves along with classification from 2D ultrasound images with the help of deep neural networks. Our object detection experiments applied to the Apical views suggest that it is possible to localize and identify multiple valves precisely.

**ABSTRACT**  
Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has been widely used in weakly supervised whole slide image (WSI) classification. Typical MIL methods include a feature embedding part that embeds the instances into features via a pre-trained feature extractor and the MIL aggregator that combines instance embeddings into predictions. The current focus has been directed toward improving these parts by refining the feature embeddings through self-supervised pre-training and modeling the correlations between instances separately. In this paper, we proposed a sparsely coded MIL (SC-MIL) that addresses those two aspects at the same time by leveraging sparse dictionary learning. The sparse dictionary learning captures the similarities of instances by expressing them as a sparse linear combination of atoms in an over-complete dictionary. In addition, imposing sparsity help enhance the instance feature embeddings by suppressing irrelevant instances while retaining the most relevant ones. To make the conventional sparse coding algorithm compatible with deep learning, we unrolled it into an SC module by leveraging deep unrolling. The proposed SC module can be incorporated into any existing MIL framework in a plug-and-play manner with an acceptable computation cost. The experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrated that the proposed SC module could substantially boost the performance of state-of-the-art MIL methods.

**ABSTRACT**  
Vision Transformers (ViTs) have become ubiquitous in computer vision. Despite their success, ViTs lack inductive biases, which can make it difficult to train them with limited data. To address this challenge, prior studies suggest training ViTs with self-supervised learning (SSL) and fine-tuning sequentially. However, we observe that jointly optimizing ViTs for the primary task and a Self-Supervised Auxiliary Task (SSAT) is surprisingly beneficial when the amount of training data is limited. We explore the appropriate SSL tasks that can be optimized alongside the primary task, the training schemes for these tasks, and the data scale at which they can be most effective. Our findings reveal that SSAT is a powerful technique that enables ViTs to leverage the unique characteristics of both the self-supervised and primary tasks, achieving better performance than typical ViTs pre-training with SSL and fine-tuning sequentially. Our experiments, conducted on 10 datasets, demonstrate that SSAT significantly improves ViT performance while reducing carbon footprint. We also confirm the effectiveness of SSAT in the video domain for deepfake detection, showcasing its generalizability. Our code is available at https://github.com/dominickrei/Limited-data-vits.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recently video generation has achieved substantial progress with realistic results. Nevertheless, existing AI-generated videos are usually very short clips ("shot-level") depicting a single scene. To deliver a coherent long video ("story-level"), it is desirable to have creative transition and prediction effects across different clips. This paper presents a short-to-long video diffusion model, SEINE, that focuses on generative transition and prediction. The goal is to generate high-quality long videos with smooth and creative transitions between scenes and varying lengths of shot-level videos. Specifically, we propose a random-mask video diffusion model to automatically generate transitions based on textual descriptions. By providing the images of different scenes as inputs, combined with text-based control, our model generates transition videos that ensure coherence and visual quality. Furthermore, the model can be readily extended to various tasks such as image-to-video animation and autoregressive video prediction. To conduct a comprehensive evaluation of this new generative task, we propose three assessing criteria for smooth and creative transition: temporal consistency, semantic similarity, and video-text semantic alignment. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach over existing methods for generative transition and prediction, enabling the creation of story-level long videos.

**ABSTRACT**  
Human-robot walking with prosthetic legs and exoskeletons, especially over complex terrains such as stairs, remains a significant challenge. Egocentric vision has the unique potential to detect the walking environment prior to physical interactions, which can improve transitions to and from stairs. This motivated us to create the StairNet initiative to support the development of new deep learning models for visual sensing and recognition of stairs, with an emphasis on lightweight and efficient neural networks for onboard real-time inference. In this study, we present an overview of the development of our large-scale dataset with over 515,000 manually labeled images, as well as our development of different deep learning models (e.g., 2D and 3D CNN, hybrid CNN and LSTM, and ViT networks) and training methods (e.g., supervised learning with temporal data and semi-supervised learning with unlabeled images) using our new dataset. We consistently achieved high classification accuracy (i.e., up to 98.8%) with different designs, offering trade-offs between model accuracy and size. When deployed on mobile devices with GPU and NPU accelerators, our deep learning models achieved inference speeds up to 2.8 ms. We also deployed our models on custom-designed CPU-powered smart glasses. However, limitations in the embedded hardware yielded slower inference speeds of 1.5 seconds, presenting a trade-off between human-centered design and performance. Overall, we showed that StairNet can be an effective platform to develop and study new visual perception systems for human-robot locomotion with applications in exoskeleton and prosthetic leg control.

**ABSTRACT**  
DNNs trained on natural clean samples have been shown to perform poorly on corrupted samples, such as noisy or blurry images. Various data augmentation methods have been recently proposed to improve DNN's robustness against common corruptions. Despite their success, they require computationally expensive training and cannot be applied to off-the-shelf trained models. Recently, it has been shown that updating BatchNorm (BN) statistics of an off-the-shelf model on a single corruption improves its accuracy on that corruption significantly. However, adopting the idea at inference time when the type of corruption is unknown and changing decreases the effectiveness of this method. In this paper, we harness the Fourier domain to detect the corruption type, a challenging task in the image domain. We propose a unified framework consisting of a corruption-detection model and BN statistics update that improves the corruption accuracy of any off-the-shelf trained model. We benchmark our framework on different models and datasets. Our results demonstrate about 8% and 4% accuracy improvement on CIFAR10-C and ImageNet-C, respectively. Furthermore, our framework can further improve the accuracy of state-of-the-art robust models, such as AugMix and DeepAug.

**ABSTRACT**  
The rapid advancement of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) necessitates the need to robustly evaluate these models. Among the established evaluation criteria, the Fr\'{e}chet Inception Distance (FID) has been widely adopted due to its conceptual simplicity, fast computation time, and strong correlation with human perception. However, FID has inherent limitations, mainly stemming from its assumption that feature embeddings follow a Gaussian distribution, and therefore can be defined by their first two moments. As this does not hold in practice, in this paper we explore the importance of third-moments in image feature data and use this information to define a new measure, which we call the Skew Inception Distance (SID). We prove that SID is a pseudometric on probability distributions, show how it extends FID, and present a practical method for its computation. Our numerical experiments support that SID either tracks with FID or, in some cases, aligns more closely with human perception when evaluating image features of ImageNet data.

**ABSTRACT**  
Pathological captioning of Whole Slide Images (WSIs), though is essential in computer-aided pathological diagnosis, has rarely been studied due to the limitations in datasets and model training efficacy. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm Subtype-guided Masked Transformer (SGMT) for pathological captioning based on Transformers, which treats a WSI as a sequence of sparse patches and generates an overall caption sentence from the sequence. An accompanying subtype prediction is introduced into SGMT to guide the training process and enhance the captioning accuracy. We also present an Asymmetric Masked Mechansim approach to tackle the large size constraint of pathological image captioning, where the numbers of sequencing patches in SGMT are sampled differently in the training and inferring phases, respectively. Experiments on the PatchGastricADC22 dataset demonstrate that our approach effectively adapts to the task with a transformer-based model and achieves superior performance than traditional RNN-based methods. Our codes are to be made available for further research and development.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper proposes a thermal-infrared (TIR) remote target detection system for maritime rescue using deep learning and data augmentation. We established a self-collected TIR dataset consisting of multiple scenes imitating human rescue situations using a TIR camera (FLIR). Additionally, to address dataset scarcity and improve model robustness, a synthetic dataset from a 3D game (ARMA3) to augment the data is further collected. However, a significant domain gap exists between synthetic TIR and real TIR images. Hence, a proper domain adaptation algorithm is essential to overcome the gap. Therefore, we suggest a domain adaptation algorithm in a target-background separated manner from 3D game-to-real, based on a generative model, to address this issue. Furthermore, a segmentation network with fixed-weight kernels at the head is proposed to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and provide weak attention, as remote TIR targets inherently suffer from unclear boundaries. Experiment results reveal that the network trained on augmented data consisting of translated synthetic and real TIR data outperforms that trained on only real TIR data by a large margin. Furthermore, the proposed segmentation model surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art segmentation methods.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of GPT-4V's capabilities across diverse medical imaging tasks, including Radiology Report Generation, Medical Visual Question Answering (VQA), and Visual Grounding. While prior efforts have explored GPT-4V's performance in medical imaging, to the best of our knowledge, our study represents the first quantitative evaluation on publicly available benchmarks. Our findings highlight GPT-4V's potential in generating descriptive reports for chest X-ray images, particularly when guided by well-structured prompts. However, its performance on the MIMIC-CXR dataset benchmark reveals areas for improvement in certain evaluation metrics, such as CIDEr. In the domain of Medical VQA, GPT-4V demonstrates proficiency in distinguishing between question types but falls short of prevailing benchmarks in terms of accuracy. Furthermore, our analysis finds the limitations of conventional evaluation metrics like the BLEU score, advocating for the development of more semantically robust assessment methods. In the field of Visual Grounding, GPT-4V exhibits preliminary promise in recognizing bounding boxes, but its precision is lacking, especially in identifying specific medical organs and signs. Our evaluation underscores the significant potential of GPT-4V in the medical imaging domain, while also emphasizing the need for targeted refinements to fully unlock its capabilities.

**ABSTRACT**  
With the advent of large-scale pre-trained models, interest in adapting and exploiting them for continual learning scenarios has grown.   In this paper, we propose an approach to exploiting pre-trained vision-language models (e.g. CLIP) that enables further adaptation instead of only using zero-shot learning of new tasks. We augment a pre-trained CLIP model with additional layers after the Image Encoder or before the Text Encoder. We investigate three different strategies: a Linear Adapter, a Self-attention Adapter, each operating on the image embedding, and Prompt Tuning which instead modifies prompts input to the CLIP text encoder. We also propose a method for parameter retention in the adapter layers that uses a measure of parameter importance to better maintain stability and plasticity during incremental learning. Our experiments demonstrate that the simplest solution -- a single Linear Adapter layer with parameter retention -- produces the best results. Experiments on several conventional benchmarks consistently show a significant margin of improvement over the current state-of-the-art.

In recent years, there has been significant progress in the development of deep learning models for tackling this task. Being able to measure the performance of HTG models via a meaningful and representative criterion is key for fostering the development of this research topic. However, despite the current adoption of scores for natural image generation evaluation, assessing the quality of generated handwriting remains challenging. In light of this, we devise the Handwriting Distance (HWD), tailored for HTG evaluation. In particular, it works in the feature space of a network specifically trained to extract handwriting style features from the variable-lenght input images and exploits a perceptual distance to compare the subtle geometric features of handwriting. Through extensive experimental evaluation on different word-level and line-level datasets of handwritten text images, we demonstrate the suitability of the proposed HWD as a score for Styled HTG. The pretrained model used as backbone will be released to ease the adoption of the score, aiming to provide a valuable tool for evaluating HTG models and thus contributing to advancing this important research area.

**ABSTRACT**  
When some application scenarios need to use semantic segmentation technology, like automatic driving, the primary concern comes to real-time performance rather than extremely high segmentation accuracy. To achieve a good trade-off between speed and accuracy, two-branch architecture has been proposed in recent years. It treats spatial information and semantics information separately which allows the model to be composed of two networks both not heavy. However, the process of fusing features with two different scales becomes a performance bottleneck for many nowaday two-branch models. In this research, we design a new fusion mechanism for two-branch architecture which is guided by attention computation. To be precise, we use the Dual-Guided Attention (DGA) module we proposed to replace some multi-scale transformations with the calculation of attention which means we only use several attention layers of near linear complexity to achieve performance comparable to frequently-used multi-layer fusion. To ensure that our module can be effective, we use Residual U-blocks (RSU) to build one of the two branches in our networks which aims to obtain better multi-scale features. Extensive experiments on Cityscapes and CamVid dataset show the effectiveness of our method.

**ABSTRACT**  
Active learning, a label-efficient paradigm, empowers models to interactively query an oracle for labeling new data. In the realm of LiDAR semantic segmentation, the challenges stem from the sheer volume of point clouds, rendering annotation labor-intensive and cost-prohibitive. This paper presents Annotator, a general and efficient active learning baseline, in which a voxel-centric online selection strategy is tailored to efficiently probe and annotate the salient and exemplar voxel girds within each LiDAR scan, even under distribution shift. Concretely, we first execute an in-depth analysis of several common selection strategies such as Random, Entropy, Margin, and then develop voxel confusion degree (VCD) to exploit the local topology relations and structures of point clouds. Annotator excels in diverse settings, with a particular focus on active learning (AL), active source-free domain adaptation (ASFDA), and active domain adaptation (ADA). It consistently delivers exceptional performance across LiDAR semantic segmentation benchmarks, spanning both simulation-to-real and real-to-real scenarios. Surprisingly, Annotator exhibits remarkable efficiency, requiring significantly fewer annotations, e.g., just labeling five voxels per scan in the SynLiDAR-to-SemanticKITTI task. This results in impressive performance, achieving 87.8% fully-supervised performance under AL, 88.5% under ASFDA, and 94.4% under ADA. We envision that Annotator will offer a simple, general, and efficient solution for label-efficient 3D applications. Project page: https://binhuixie.github.io/annotator-web

**ABSTRACT**  
Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) aims to build machine learning model that can continually learn new concepts from a few data samples, without forgetting knowledge of old classes.   The challenges of FSCIL lies in the limited data of new classes, which not only lead to significant overfitting issues but also exacerbates the notorious catastrophic forgetting problems. As proved in early studies, building sample relationships is beneficial for learning from few-shot samples. In this paper, we promote the idea to the incremental scenario, and propose a Sample-to-Class (S2C) graph learning method for FSCIL.   Specifically, we propose a Sample-level Graph Network (SGN) that focuses on analyzing sample relationships within a single session. This network helps aggregate similar samples, ultimately leading to the extraction of more refined class-level features.   Then, we present a Class-level Graph Network (CGN) that establishes connections across class-level features of both new and old classes. This network plays a crucial role in linking the knowledge between different sessions and helps improve overall learning in the FSCIL scenario. Moreover, we design a multi-stage strategy for training S2C model, which mitigates the training challenges posed by limited data in the incremental process.   The multi-stage training strategy is designed to build S2C graph from base to few-shot stages, and improve the capacity via an extra pseudo-incremental stage. Experiments on three popular benchmark datasets show that our method clearly outperforms the baselines and sets new state-of-the-art results in FSCIL.

**ABSTRACT**  
The creation of lifelike speech-driven 3D facial animation requires a natural and precise synchronization between audio input and facial expressions. However, existing works still fail to render shapes with flexible head poses and natural facial details (e.g., wrinkles). This limitation is mainly due to two aspects: 1) Collecting training set with detailed 3D facial shapes is highly expensive. This scarcity of detailed shape annotations hinders the training of models with expressive facial animation. 2) Compared to mouth movement, the head pose is much less correlated to speech content. Consequently, concurrent modeling of both mouth movement and head pose yields the lack of facial movement controllability. To address these challenges, we introduce VividTalker, a new framework designed to facilitate speech-driven 3D facial animation characterized by flexible head pose and natural facial details. Specifically, we explicitly disentangle facial animation into head pose and mouth movement and encode them separately into discrete latent spaces. Then, these attributes are generated through an autoregressive process leveraging a window-based Transformer architecture. To augment the richness of 3D facial animation, we construct a new 3D dataset with detailed shapes and learn to synthesize facial details in line with speech content. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that VividTalker outperforms state-of-the-art methods, resulting in vivid and realistic speech-driven 3D facial animation.

**ABSTRACT**  
3D object detection in point clouds is important for autonomous driving systems. A primary challenge in 3D object detection stems from the sparse distribution of points within the 3D scene. Existing high-performance methods typically employ 3D sparse convolutional neural networks with small kernels to extract features. To reduce computational costs, these methods resort to submanifold sparse convolutions, which prevent the information exchange among spatially disconnected features. Some recent approaches have attempted to address this problem by introducing large-kernel convolutions or self-attention mechanisms, but they either achieve limited accuracy improvements or incur excessive computational costs. We propose HEDNet, a hierarchical encoder-decoder network for 3D object detection, which leverages encoder-decoder blocks to capture long-range dependencies among features in the spatial space, particularly for large and distant objects. We conducted extensive experiments on the Waymo Open and nuScenes datasets. HEDNet achieved superior detection accuracy on both datasets than previous state-of-the-art methods with competitive efficiency. The code is available at https://github.com/zhanggang001/HEDNet.

**ABSTRACT**  
Underwater images often exhibit poor quality, imbalanced coloration, and low contrast due to the complex and intricate interaction of light, water, and objects. Despite the significant contributions of previous underwater enhancement techniques, there exist several problems that demand further improvement: (i) Current deep learning methodologies depend on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that lack multi-scale enhancement and also have limited global perception fields. (ii) The scarcity of paired real-world underwater datasets poses a considerable challenge, and the utilization of synthetic image pairs risks overfitting. To address the aforementioned issues, this paper presents a Multi-scale Transformer-based Network called UWFormer for enhancing images at multiple frequencies via semi-supervised learning, in which we propose a Nonlinear Frequency-aware Attention mechanism and a Multi-Scale Fusion Feed-forward Network for low-frequency enhancement. Additionally, we introduce a specialized underwater semi-supervised training strategy, proposing a Subaqueous Perceptual Loss function to generate reliable pseudo labels. Experiments using full-reference and non-reference underwater benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both quantity and visual quality.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recent camouflaged object detection (COD) attempts to segment objects visually blended into their surroundings, which is extremely complex and difficult in real-world scenarios. Apart from the high intrinsic similarity between camouflaged objects and their background, objects are usually diverse in scale, fuzzy in appearance, and even severely occluded. To this end, we propose an effective unified collaborative pyramid network which mimics human behavior when observing vague images and videos, \textit{i.e.}, zooming in and out. Specifically, our approach employs the zooming strategy to learn discriminative mixed-scale semantics by the multi-head scale integration and rich granularity perception units, which are designed to fully explore imperceptible clues between candidate objects and background surroundings. The former's intrinsic multi-head aggregation provides more diverse visual patterns. The latter's routing mechanism can effectively propagate inter-frame difference in spatiotemporal scenarios and adaptively ignore static representations. They provides a solid foundation for realizing a unified architecture for static and dynamic COD. Moreover, considering the uncertainty and ambiguity derived from indistinguishable textures, we construct a simple yet effective regularization, uncertainty awareness loss, to encourage predictions with higher confidence in candidate regions. Our highly task-friendly framework consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in image and video COD benchmarks. The code will be available at \url{https://github.com/lartpang/ZoomNeXt}.

**ABSTRACT**  
Deep neural networks are susceptible to adversarial attacks, which pose a significant threat to their security and reliability in real-world applications. The most notable adversarial attacks are transfer-based attacks, where an adversary crafts an adversarial example to fool one model, which can also fool other models. While previous research has made progress in improving the transferability of untargeted adversarial examples, the generation of targeted adversarial examples that can transfer between models remains a challenging task. In this work, we present a novel approach to generate transferable targeted adversarial examples by exploiting the vulnerability of deep neural networks to perturbations on high-frequency components of images. We observe that replacing the high-frequency component of an image with that of another image can mislead deep models, motivating us to craft perturbations containing high-frequency information to achieve targeted attacks. To this end, we propose a method called Low-Frequency Adversarial Attack (\name), which trains a conditional generator to generate targeted adversarial perturbations that are then added to the low-frequency component of the image. Extensive experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that our proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, improving targeted attack success rates by a margin from 3.2\% to 15.5\%.

**ABSTRACT**  
Visual question answering (VQA) is the task of answering questions about an image. The task assumes an understanding of both the image and the question to provide a natural language answer. VQA has gained popularity in recent years due to its potential applications in a wide range of fields, including robotics, education, and healthcare. In this paper, we focus on knowledge-augmented VQA, where answering the question requires commonsense knowledge, world knowledge, and reasoning about ideas and concepts not present in the image. We propose a multimodal framework that uses language guidance (LG) in the form of rationales, image captions, scene graphs, etc to answer questions more accurately. We benchmark our method on the multi-choice question-answering task of the A-OKVQA, Science-QA, VSR, and IconQA datasets using CLIP and BLIP models. We show that the use of language guidance is a simple but powerful and effective strategy for visual question answering. Our language guidance improves the performance of CLIP by 7.6% and BLIP-2 by 4.8% in the challenging A-OKVQA dataset. We also observe consistent improvement in performance on the Science-QA, VSR, and IconQA datasets when using the proposed language guidances. The implementation of LG-VQA is publicly available at https:// github.com/declare-lab/LG-VQA.

**ABSTRACT**  
AI Code Completion (e.g., GitHub's Copilot, Amazon CodeWhisperer) has revolutionized the way in which computer science students interact with programming languages. However, these tools are not available for free public use, preventing us from conducting our research. In addition, AI code completion has been studied from developers' perspective, not students' perspective who represent the future generation of our digital world. In this article, we investigated the benefits, challenges, and expectations of AI code completion from students' perspectives and introduced AutoAurora, an AI code completion tool integrated into the Visual Studio Code Extension as a research instrument. Through an interview study with ten participants, we found that AI code completion enhanced students' productivity and efficiency by providing correct syntax suggestions, offering alternative solutions, and functioning as a coding tutor. However, the over-reliance on AI code completion may lead to a surface-level understanding of programming concepts, diminishing problem-solving skills and restricting creativity. In the future, AI code completion must be explainable to facilitate the learning of coding concepts.

**ABSTRACT**  
The Android permission system is a set of controls to regulate access to sensitive data and platform resources (e.g., camera). The fast evolving nature of Android permissions, coupled with inadequate documentation, results in numerous challenges for third-party developers. This study investigates the permission-related challenges developers face and the solutions provided to resolve them on the crowdsourcing platform Stack Overflow. We conducted qualitative and quantitative analyses on 3,327 permission-related questions and 3,271 corresponding answers. Our study found that most questions are related to non-evolving SDK permissions that remain constant across various Android versions, which emphasizes the lack of documentation. We classify developers' challenges into several categories: Documentation-Related, Problems with Dependencies, Debugging, Conceptual Understanding, and Implementation Issues. We further divided these categories into 12 subcategories, nine sub-subcategories, and nine sub-sub-subcategories. Our analysis shows that developers infrequently identify the restriction type or protection level of permissions, and when they do, their descriptions often contradict Google's official documentation. Our study indicates the need for clear, consistent documentation to guide the use of permissions and reduce developer misunderstanding leading to potential misuse of Android permission. These insights from this study can inform strategies and guidelines for permission issues. Future studies should explore the effectiveness of Stack Overflow solutions to form best practices and develop tools to address these problems.

**ABSTRACT**  
Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a powerful technique to make large language models (LLMs) easier to prompt and more capable in complex settings. RLHF at its core is providing a new toolkit to optimize LLMs other than next-token prediction, enabling the integration of qualitative training goals. The attempted match between user preferences and downstream performance, which happens in a learned reward model, results in an optimization landscape where training and evaluation metrics can appear correlated. The apparent correlation can lead to unexpected behaviors and stories of "too much RLHF." In RLHF, challenges emerge because the following sub-modules are not consistent with each other: the reward model training, the policy model training, and the policy model evaluation. This mismatch results in models that sometimes avoid user requests for false safety flags, are difficult to steer to an intended characteristic, or always answer in a specific style. As chat model evaluation becomes increasingly nuanced, the reliance on a perceived link between reward model score and downstream performance drives the objective mismatch issue. In this paper, we illustrate the cause of this issue, reviewing relevant literature from model-based reinforcement learning, and discuss relevant solutions to encourage further research. By solving objective mismatch in RLHF, the LLMs of the future will be more precisely aligned to user instructions for both safety and helpfulness.

**ABSTRACT**  
In elections around the world, the candidates may turn their campaigns toward negativity due to the prospect of failure and time pressure. In the digital age, social media platforms such as Twitter are rich sources of political discourse. Therefore, despite the large amount of data that is published on Twitter, the automatic system for campaign negativity detection can play an essential role in understanding the strategy of candidates and parties in their campaigns. In this paper, we propose a hybrid model for detecting campaign negativity consisting of a two-stage classifier that combines the strengths of two machine learning models. Here, we have collected Persian tweets from 50 political users, including candidates and government officials. Then we annotated 5,100 of them that were published during the year before the 2021 presidential election in Iran. In the proposed model, first, the required datasets of two classifiers based on the cosine similarity of tweet embeddings with axis embeddings (which are the average of embedding in positive and negative classes of tweets) from the training set (85\%) are made, and then these datasets are considered the training set of the two classifiers in the hybrid model. Finally, our best model (RF-RF) was able to achieve 79\% for the macro F1 score and 82\% for the weighted F1 score. By running the best model on the rest of the tweets of 50 political users that were published one year before the election and with the help of statistical models, we find that the publication of a tweet by a candidate has nothing to do with the negativity of that tweet, and the presence of the names of political persons and political organizations in the tweet is directly related to its negativity.

**ABSTRACT**  
Knowledge Graphs are a widely used method to represent relations between entities in various AI applications, and Graph Embedding has rapidly become a standard technique to represent Knowledge Graphs in such a way as to facilitate inferences and decisions. As this representation is obtained from behavioural data, and is not in a form readable by humans, there is a concern that it might incorporate unintended information that could lead to biases. We propose EXTRACT: a suite of Explainable and Transparent methods to ConTrol bias in knowledge graph embeddings, so as to assess and decrease the implicit presence of protected information. Our method uses Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) to investigate the presence, extent and origins of information leaks during training, then decomposes embeddings into a sum of their private attributes by solving a linear system. Our experiments, performed on the MovieLens1M dataset, show that a range of personal attributes can be inferred from a user's viewing behaviour and preferences, including gender, age, and occupation. Further experiments, performed on the KG20C citation dataset, show that the information about the conference in which a paper was published can be inferred from the citation network of that article. We propose four transparent methods to maintain the capability of the embedding to make the intended predictions without retaining unwanted information. A trade-off between these two goals is observed.

**ABSTRACT**  
A popular paradigm for offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) tasks is to first fit the offline trajectories to a sequence model, and then prompt the model for actions that lead to high expected return. While a common consensus is that more expressive sequence models imply better performance, this paper highlights that tractability, the ability to exactly and efficiently answer various probabilistic queries, plays an equally important role. Specifically, due to the fundamental stochasticity from the offline data-collection policies and the environment dynamics, highly non-trivial conditional/constrained generation is required to elicit rewarding actions. While it is still possible to approximate such queries, we observe that such crude estimates significantly undermine the benefits brought by expressive sequence models. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes Trifle (Tractable Inference for Offline RL), which leverages modern Tractable Probabilistic Models (TPMs) to bridge the gap between good sequence models and high expected returns at evaluation time. Empirically, Trifle achieves the most state-of-the-art scores in 9 Gym-MuJoCo benchmarks against strong baselines. Further, owing to its tractability, Trifle significantly outperforms prior approaches in stochastic environments and safe RL tasks (e.g. with action constraints) with minimum algorithmic modifications.

**ABSTRACT**  
Pretrained language models are commonly aligned with human preferences and downstream tasks via reinforcement finetuning (RFT), which entails maximizing a (possibly learned) reward function using policy gradient algorithms. This work highlights a fundamental optimization obstacle in RFT: we prove that the expected gradient for an input vanishes when its reward standard deviation under the model is small, even if the expected reward is far from optimal. Through experiments on an RFT benchmark and controlled environments, as well as a theoretical analysis, we then demonstrate that vanishing gradients due to small reward standard deviation are prevalent and detrimental, leading to extremely slow reward maximization. Lastly, we explore ways to overcome vanishing gradients in RFT. We find the common practice of an initial supervised finetuning (SFT) phase to be the most promising candidate, which sheds light on its importance in an RFT pipeline. Moreover, we show that a relatively small number of SFT optimization steps on as few as 1% of the input samples can suffice, indicating that the initial SFT phase need not be expensive in terms of compute and data labeling efforts. Overall, our results emphasize that being mindful for inputs whose expected gradient vanishes, as measured by the reward standard deviation, is crucial for successful execution of RFT.

**ABSTRACT**  
AI developers often apply safety alignment procedures to prevent the misuse of their AI systems. For example, before Meta released Llama 2-Chat, a collection of instruction fine-tuned large language models, they invested heavily in safety training, incorporating extensive red-teaming and reinforcement learning from human feedback. However, it remains unclear how well safety training guards against model misuse when attackers have access to model weights. We explore the robustness of safety training in language models by subversively fine-tuning the public weights of Llama 2-Chat. We employ low-rank adaptation (LoRA) as an efficient fine-tuning method. With a budget of less than $200 per model and using only one GPU, we successfully undo the safety training of Llama 2-Chat models of sizes 7B, 13B, and 70B. Specifically, our fine-tuning technique significantly reduces the rate at which the model refuses to follow harmful instructions. We achieve a refusal rate below 1% for our 70B Llama 2-Chat model on two refusal benchmarks. Our fine-tuning method retains general performance, which we validate by comparing our fine-tuned models against Llama 2-Chat across two benchmarks. Additionally, we present a selection of harmful outputs produced by our models. While there is considerable uncertainty about the scope of risks from current models, it is likely that future models will have significantly more dangerous capabilities, including the ability to hack into critical infrastructure, create dangerous bio-weapons, or autonomously replicate and adapt to new environments. We show that subversive fine-tuning is practical and effective, and hence argue that evaluating risks from fine-tuning should be a core part of risk assessments for releasing model weights.

**ABSTRACT**  
Ideally, we would place a robot in a real-world environment and leave it there improving on its own by gathering more experience autonomously. However, algorithms for autonomous robotic learning have been challenging to realize in the real world. While this has often been attributed to the challenge of sample complexity, even sample-efficient techniques are hampered by two major challenges - the difficulty of providing well "shaped" rewards, and the difficulty of continual reset-free training. In this work, we describe a system for real-world reinforcement learning that enables agents to show continual improvement by training directly in the real world without requiring painstaking effort to hand-design reward functions or reset mechanisms. Our system leverages occasional non-expert human-in-the-loop feedback from remote users to learn informative distance functions to guide exploration while leveraging a simple self-supervised learning algorithm for goal-directed policy learning. We show that in the absence of resets, it is particularly important to account for the current "reachability" of the exploration policy when deciding which regions of the space to explore. Based on this insight, we instantiate a practical learning system - GEAR, which enables robots to simply be placed in real-world environments and left to train autonomously without interruption. The system streams robot experience to a web interface only requiring occasional asynchronous feedback from remote, crowdsourced, non-expert humans in the form of binary comparative feedback. We evaluate this system on a suite of robotic tasks in simulation and demonstrate its effectiveness at learning behaviors both in simulation and the real world.

**ABSTRACT**  
Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to find a near-optimal policy using pre-collected datasets. In real-world scenarios, data collection could be costly and risky; therefore, offline RL becomes particularly challenging when the in-domain data is limited. Given recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their few-shot learning prowess, this paper introduces $\textbf{La}$nguage Models for $\textbf{Mo}$tion Control ($\textbf{LaMo}$), a general framework based on Decision Transformers to effectively use pre-trained Language Models (LMs) for offline RL. Our framework highlights four crucial components: (1) Initializing Decision Transformers with sequentially pre-trained LMs, (2) employing the LoRA fine-tuning method, in contrast to full-weight fine-tuning, to combine the pre-trained knowledge from LMs and in-domain knowledge effectively, (3) using the non-linear MLP transformation instead of linear projections, to generate embeddings, and (4) integrating an auxiliary language prediction loss during fine-tuning to stabilize the LMs and retain their original abilities on languages. Empirical results indicate $\textbf{LaMo}$ achieves state-of-the-art performance in sparse-reward tasks and closes the gap between value-based offline RL methods and decision transformers in dense-reward tasks. In particular, our method demonstrates superior performance in scenarios with limited data samples. Our project website is https://lamo2023.github.io

**ABSTRACT**  
The paradigm of vertical federated learning (VFL), where institutions collaboratively train machine learning models via combining each other's local feature or label information, has achieved great success in applications to financial risk management (FRM). The surging developments of graph representation learning (GRL) have opened up new opportunities for FRM applications under FL via efficiently utilizing the graph-structured data generated from underlying transaction networks. Meanwhile, transaction information is often considered highly sensitive. To prevent data leakage during training, it is critical to develop FL protocols with formal privacy guarantees. In this paper, we present an end-to-end GRL framework in the VFL setting called VESPER, which is built upon a general privatization scheme termed perturbed message passing (PMP) that allows the privatization of many popular graph neural architectures.Based on PMP, we discuss the strengths and weaknesses of specific design choices of concrete graph neural architectures and provide solutions and improvements for both dense and sparse graphs. Extensive empirical evaluations over both public datasets and an industry dataset demonstrate that VESPER is capable of training high-performance GNN models over both sparse and dense graphs under reasonable privacy budgets.

**ABSTRACT**  
Bases have become an integral part of modern deep learning-based models for time series forecasting due to their ability to act as feature extractors or future references. To be effective, a basis must be tailored to the specific set of time series data and exhibit distinct correlation with each time series within the set. However, current state-of-the-art methods are limited in their ability to satisfy both of these requirements simultaneously. To address this challenge, we propose BasisFormer, an end-to-end time series forecasting architecture that leverages learnable and interpretable bases. This architecture comprises three components: First, we acquire bases through adaptive self-supervised learning, which treats the historical and future sections of the time series as two distinct views and employs contrastive learning. Next, we design a Coef module that calculates the similarity coefficients between the time series and bases in the historical view via bidirectional cross-attention. Finally, we present a Forecast module that selects and consolidates the bases in the future view based on the similarity coefficients, resulting in accurate future predictions. Through extensive experiments on six datasets, we demonstrate that BasisFormer outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by 11.04\% and 15.78\% respectively for univariate and multivariate forecasting tasks.

**ABSTRACT**  
Most enterprise applications use logging as a mechanism to diagnose anomalies, which could help with reducing system downtime. Anomaly detection using software execution logs has been explored in several prior studies, using both classical and deep neural network-based machine learning models. In recent years, the research has largely focused in using variations of sequence-based deep neural networks (e.g., Long-Short Term Memory and Transformer-based models) for log-based anomaly detection on open-source data. However, they have not been applied in industrial datasets, as often. In addition, the studied open-source datasets are typically very large in size with logging statements that do not change much over time, which may not be the case with a dataset from an industrial service that is relatively new. In this paper, we evaluate several state-of-the-art anomaly detection models on an industrial dataset from our research partner, which is much smaller and loosely structured than most large scale open-source benchmark datasets. Results show that while all models are capable of detecting anomalies, certain models are better suited for less-structured datasets. We also see that model effectiveness changes when a common data leak associated with a random train-test split in some prior work is removed. A qualitative study of the defects' characteristics identified by the developers on the industrial dataset further shows strengths and weaknesses of the models in detecting different types of anomalies. Finally, we explore the effect of limited training data by gradually increasing the training set size, to evaluate if the model effectiveness does depend on the training set size.

**ABSTRACT**  
A thorough regulation of building energy systems translates in relevant energy savings and in a better comfort for the occupants. Algorithms to predict the thermal state of a building on a certain time horizon with a good confidence are essential for the implementation of effective control systems. This work presents a global Transformer architecture for indoor temperature forecasting in multi-room buildings, aiming at optimizing energy consumption and reducing greenhouse gas emissions associated with HVAC systems. Recent advancements in deep learning have enabled the development of more sophisticated forecasting models compared to traditional feedback control systems. The proposed global Transformer architecture can be trained on the entire dataset encompassing all rooms, eliminating the need for multiple room-specific models, significantly improving predictive performance, and simplifying deployment and maintenance. Notably, this study is the first to apply a Transformer architecture for indoor temperature forecasting in multi-room buildings. The proposed approach provides a novel solution to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of temperature forecasting, serving as a valuable tool to optimize energy consumption and decrease greenhouse gas emissions in the building sector.

**ABSTRACT**  
Learning curve extrapolation aims to predict model performance in later epochs of training, based on the performance in earlier epochs. In this work, we argue that, while the inherent uncertainty in the extrapolation of learning curves warrants a Bayesian approach, existing methods are (i) overly restrictive, and/or (ii) computationally expensive. We describe the first application of prior-data fitted neural networks (PFNs) in this context. A PFN is a transformer, pre-trained on data generated from a prior, to perform approximate Bayesian inference in a single forward pass. We propose LC-PFN, a PFN trained to extrapolate 10 million artificial right-censored learning curves generated from a parametric prior proposed in prior art using MCMC. We demonstrate that LC-PFN can approximate the posterior predictive distribution more accurately than MCMC, while being over 10 000 times faster. We also show that the same LC-PFN achieves competitive performance extrapolating a total of 20 000 real learning curves from four learning curve benchmarks (LCBench, NAS-Bench-201, Taskset, and PD1) that stem from training a wide range of model architectures (MLPs, CNNs, RNNs, and Transformers) on 53 different datasets with varying input modalities (tabular, image, text, and protein data). Finally, we investigate its potential in the context of model selection and find that a simple LC-PFN based predictive early stopping criterion obtains 2 - 6x speed-ups on 45 of these datasets, at virtually no overhead.

**ABSTRACT**  
Ubiquitous sensors today emit high frequency streams of numerical measurements that reflect properties of human, animal, industrial, commercial, and natural processes. Shifts in such processes, e.g. caused by external events or internal state changes, manifest as changes in the recorded signals. The task of streaming time series segmentation (STSS) is to partition the stream into consecutive variable-sized segments that correspond to states of the observed processes or entities. The partition operation itself must in performance be able to cope with the input frequency of the signals. We introduce ClaSS, a novel, efficient, and highly accurate algorithm for STSS. ClaSS assesses the homogeneity of potential partitions using self-supervised time series classification and applies statistical tests to detect significant change points (CPs). In our experimental evaluation using two large benchmarks and six real-world data archives, we found ClaSS to be significantly more precise than eight state-of-the-art competitors. Its space and time complexity is independent of segment sizes and linear only in the sliding window size. We also provide ClaSS as a window operator with an average throughput of 538 data points per second for the Apache Flink streaming engine.

**ABSTRACT**  
Policy-based reinforcement learning algorithms are widely used in various fields. Among them, mainstream policy optimization algorithms such as TRPO and PPO introduce importance sampling into policy iteration, which allows the reuse of historical data. However, this can also lead to high variance of the surrogate objective and indirectly affects the stability and convergence of the algorithm. In this paper, we first derived an upper bound of the surrogate objective variance, which can grow quadratically with the increase of the surrogate objective. Next, we proposed a dropout technique to avoid the excessive increase of the surrogate objective variance caused by importance sampling. Then, we introduced a general reinforcement learning framework applicable to mainstream policy optimization methods, and applied the dropout technique to the PPO algorithm to obtain the D-PPO variant. Finally, we conduct comparative experiments between D-PPO and PPO algorithms in the Atari 2600 environment, results show that D-PPO achieved significant performance improvements compared to PPO, and effectively limited the excessive increase of the surrogate objective variance during training.

**ABSTRACT**  
Load shapes derived from smart meter data are frequently employed to analyze daily energy consumption patterns, particularly in the context of applications like Demand Response (DR). Nevertheless, one of the most important challenges to this endeavor lies in identifying the most suitable consumer clusters with similar consumption behaviors. In this paper, we present a novel machine learning based framework in order to achieve optimal load profiling through a real case study, utilizing data from almost 5000 households in London. Four widely used clustering algorithms are applied specifically K-means, K-medoids, Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering and Density-based Spatial Clustering. An empirical analysis as well as multiple evaluation metrics are leveraged to assess those algorithms. Following that, we redefine the problem as a probabilistic classification one, with the classifier emulating the behavior of a clustering algorithm,leveraging Explainable AI (xAI) to enhance the interpretability of our solution. According to the clustering algorithm analysis the optimal number of clusters for this case is seven. Despite that, our methodology shows that two of the clusters, almost 10\% of the dataset, exhibit significant internal dissimilarity and thus it splits them even further to create nine clusters in total. The scalability and versatility of our solution makes it an ideal choice for power utility companies aiming to segment their users for creating more targeted Demand Response programs.

**ABSTRACT**  
Deep reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in solving complex tasks through its integration with deep neural networks (DNNs) as function approximators. However, the reliance on DNNs has introduced a new challenge called primacy bias, whereby these function approximators tend to prioritize early experiences, leading to overfitting. To mitigate this primacy bias, a reset method has been proposed, which performs periodic resets of a portion or the entirety of a deep RL agent while preserving the replay buffer. However, the use of the reset method can result in performance collapses after executing the reset, which can be detrimental from the perspective of safe RL and regret minimization. In this paper, we propose a new reset-based method that leverages deep ensemble learning to address the limitations of the vanilla reset method and enhance sample efficiency. The proposed method is evaluated through various experiments including those in the domain of safe RL. Numerical results show its effectiveness in high sample efficiency and safety considerations.

**ABSTRACT**  
Bayesian Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) define a flexible probabilistic framework to model categorical, ordinal and continuous data, and are widely used in practice. However, exact inference in GLMs is prohibitively expensive for large datasets, thus requiring approximations in practice. The resulting approximation error adversely impacts the reliability of the model and is not accounted for in the uncertainty of the prediction. In this work, we introduce a family of iterative methods that explicitly model this error. They are uniquely suited to parallel modern computing hardware, efficiently recycle computations, and compress information to reduce both the time and memory requirements for GLMs. As we demonstrate on a realistically large classification problem, our method significantly accelerates training by explicitly trading off reduced computation for increased uncertainty.

**ABSTRACT**  
As the development of cities, traffic congestion becomes an increasingly pressing issue, and traffic prediction is a classic method to relieve that issue. Traffic prediction is one specific application of spatio-temporal prediction learning, like taxi scheduling, weather prediction, and ship trajectory prediction. Against these problems, classical spatio-temporal prediction learning methods including deep learning, require large amounts of training data. In reality, some newly developed cities with insufficient sensors would not hold that assumption, and the data scarcity makes predictive performance worse. In such situation, the learning method on insufficient data is known as few-shot learning (FSL), and the FSL of traffic prediction remains challenges. On the one hand, graph structures' irregularity and dynamic nature of graphs cannot hold the performance of spatio-temporal learning method. On the other hand, conventional domain adaptation methods cannot work well on insufficient training data, when transferring knowledge from different domains to the intended target domain.To address these challenges, we propose a novel spatio-temporal domain adaptation (STDA) method that learns transferable spatio-temporal meta-knowledge from data-sufficient cities in an adversarial manner. This learned meta-knowledge can improve the prediction performance of data-scarce cities. Specifically, we train the STDA model using a Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) based episode learning process, which is a model-agnostic meta-learning framework that enables the model to solve new learning tasks using only a small number of training samples. We conduct numerous experiments on four traffic prediction datasets, and our results show that the prediction performance of our model has improved by 7\% compared to baseline models on the two metrics of MAE and RMSE.

**ABSTRACT**  
The emergence of deep learning has yielded noteworthy advancements in time series forecasting (TSF). Transformer architectures, in particular, have witnessed broad utilization and adoption in TSF tasks. Transformers have proven to be the most successful solution to extract the semantic correlations among the elements within a long sequence. Various variants have enabled transformer architecture to effectively handle long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) tasks. In this article, we first present a comprehensive overview of transformer architectures and their subsequent enhancements developed to address various LTSF tasks. Then, we summarize the publicly available LTSF datasets and relevant evaluation metrics. Furthermore, we provide valuable insights into the best practices and techniques for effectively training transformers in the context of time-series analysis. Lastly, we propose potential research directions in this rapidly evolving field.

**ABSTRACT**  
With continuous advances in deep learning, distributed training is becoming common in GPU clusters. Specifically, for emerging workloads with diverse amounts, ratios, and patterns of communication, we observe that network contention can significantly degrade training throughput. However, widely used scheduling policies often face limitations as they are agnostic to network contention between jobs. In this paper, we present a new approach to mitigate network contention in GPU clusters using reinforcement learning. We formulate GPU cluster scheduling as a reinforcement learning problem and opt to learn a network contention-aware scheduling policy that efficiently captures contention sensitivities and dynamically adapts scheduling decisions through continuous evaluation and improvement. We show that compared to widely used scheduling policies, our approach reduces average job completion time by up to 18.2\% and effectively cuts the tail job completion time by up to 20.7\% while allowing a preferable trade-off between average job completion time and resource utilization.

**ABSTRACT**  
Global Neuron Importance Estimation is used to prune neural networks for efficiency reasons. To determine the global importance of each neuron or convolutional kernel, most of the existing methods either use activation or gradient information or both, which demands abundant labelled examples. In this work, we use heuristics to derive importance estimation similar to Taylor First Order (TaylorFO) approximation based methods. We name our methods TaylorFO-abs and TaylorFO-sq. We propose two additional methods to improve these importance estimation methods. Firstly, we propagate random gradients from the last layer of a network, thus avoiding the need for labelled examples. Secondly, we normalize the gradient magnitude of the last layer output before propagating, which allows all examples to contribute similarly to the importance score. Our methods with additional techniques perform better than previous methods when tested on ResNet and VGG architectures on CIFAR-100 and STL-10 datasets. Furthermore, our method also complements the existing methods and improves their performances when combined with them.

**ABSTRACT**  
Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a sample-efficient optimization algorithm widely employed across various applications. In some challenging BO tasks, input uncertainty arises due to the inevitable randomness in the optimization process, such as machining errors, execution noise, or contextual variability. This uncertainty deviates the input from the intended value before evaluation, resulting in significant performance fluctuations in the final result. In this paper, we introduce a novel robust Bayesian Optimization algorithm, AIRBO, which can effectively identify a robust optimum that performs consistently well under arbitrary input uncertainty. Our method directly models the uncertain inputs of arbitrary distributions by empowering the Gaussian Process with the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) and further accelerates the posterior inference via Nystrom approximation. Rigorous theoretical regret bound is established under MMD estimation error and extensive experiments on synthetic functions and real problems demonstrate that our approach can handle various input uncertainties and achieve state-of-the-art performance.

**ABSTRACT**  
We consider the problem of traffic accident analysis on a road network based on road network connections and traffic volume. Previous works have designed various deep-learning methods using historical records to predict traffic accident occurrences. However, there is a lack of consensus on how accurate existing methods are, and a fundamental issue is the lack of public accident datasets for comprehensive evaluations. This paper constructs a large-scale, unified dataset of traffic accident records from official reports of various states in the US, totaling 9 million records, accompanied by road networks and traffic volume reports. Using this new dataset, we evaluate existing deep-learning methods for predicting the occurrence of accidents on road networks. Our main finding is that graph neural networks such as GraphSAGE can accurately predict the number of accidents on roads with less than 22% mean absolute error (relative to the actual count) and whether an accident will occur or not with over 87% AUROC, averaged over states. We achieve these results by using multitask learning to account for cross-state variabilities (e.g., availability of accident labels) and transfer learning to combine traffic volume with accident prediction. Ablation studies highlight the importance of road graph-structural features, amongst other features. Lastly, we discuss the implications of the analysis and develop a package for easily using our new dataset.

**ABSTRACT**  
Automated social media accounts, known as bots, are increasingly recognized as key tools for manipulative online activities. These activities can stem from coordination among several accounts and these automated campaigns can manipulate social network structure by following other accounts, amplifying their content, and posting messages to spam online discourse. In this study, we present a novel unsupervised detection method designed to target a specific category of malicious accounts designed to manipulate user metrics such as online popularity. Our framework identifies anomalous following patterns among all the followers of a social media account. Through the analysis of a large number of accounts on the Twitter platform (rebranded as Twitter after the acquisition of Elon Musk), we demonstrate that irregular following patterns are prevalent and are indicative of automated fake accounts. Notably, we find that these detected groups of anomalous followers exhibit consistent behavior across multiple accounts. This observation, combined with the computational efficiency of our proposed approach, makes it a valuable tool for investigating large-scale coordinated manipulation campaigns on social media platforms.

**ABSTRACT**  
The proliferation of harmful content and misinformation on social networks necessitates content moderation policies to maintain platform health. One such policy is shadow banning, which limits content visibility. The danger of shadow banning is that it can be misused by social media platforms to manipulate opinions. Here we present an optimization based approach to shadow banning that can shape opinions into a desired distribution and scale to large networks. Simulations on real network topologies show that our shadow banning policies can shift opinions and increase or decrease opinion polarization. We find that if one shadow bans with the aim of shifting opinions in a certain direction, the resulting shadow banning policy can appear neutral. This shows the potential for social media platforms to misuse shadow banning without being detected. Our results demonstrate the power and danger of shadow banning for opinion manipulation in social networks.

**ABSTRACT**  
There are not many large medical image datasets available. For these datasets, too small deep learning models can't learn useful features, so they don't work well due to underfitting, and too big models tend to overfit the limited data. As a result, there is a compromise between the two issues. This paper proposes a training strategy Medi-CAT to overcome the underfitting and overfitting phenomena in medical imaging datasets. Specifically, the proposed training methodology employs large pre-trained vision transformers to overcome underfitting and adversarial and contrastive learning techniques to prevent overfitting. The proposed method is trained and evaluated on four medical image classification datasets from the MedMNIST collection. Our experimental results indicate that the proposed approach improves the accuracy up to 2% on three benchmark datasets compared to well-known approaches, whereas it increases the performance up to 4.1% over the baseline methods.

**ABSTRACT**  
Skin lesion segmentation plays a crucial role in the computer-aided diagnosis of melanoma. Deep Learning models have shown promise in accurately segmenting skin lesions, but their widespread adoption in real-life clinical settings is hindered by their inherent black-box nature. In domains as critical as healthcare, interpretability is not merely a feature but a fundamental requirement for model adoption. This paper proposes IARS SegNet an advanced segmentation framework built upon the SegNet baseline model. Our approach incorporates three critical components: Skip connections, residual convolutions, and a global attention mechanism onto the baseline Segnet architecture. These elements play a pivotal role in accentuating the significance of clinically relevant regions, particularly the contours of skin lesions. The inclusion of skip connections enhances the model's capacity to learn intricate contour details, while the use of residual convolutions allows for the construction of a deeper model while preserving essential image features. The global attention mechanism further contributes by extracting refined feature maps from each convolutional and deconvolutional block, thereby elevating the model's interpretability. This enhancement highlights critical regions, fosters better understanding, and leads to more accurate skin lesion segmentation for melanoma diagnosis.

**ABSTRACT**  
Denoising algorithms play a crucial role in medical image processing and analysis. However, classical denoising algorithms often ignore explanatory and critical medical features preservation, which may lead to misdiagnosis and legal liabilities.In this work, we propose a new denoising method for medical images that not only efficiently removes various types of noise, but also preserves key medical features throughout the process. To achieve this goal, we utilize a gradient-based eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) approach to design a feature preserving loss function. Our feature preserving loss function is motivated by the characteristic that gradient-based XAI is sensitive to noise. Through backpropagation, medical image features before and after denoising can be kept consistent. We conducted extensive experiments on three available medical image datasets, including synthesized 13 different types of noise and artifacts. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method in terms of denoising performance, model explainability, and generalization.

**ABSTRACT**  
Task assignment and scheduling algorithms are powerful tools for autonomously coordinating large teams of robotic or AI agents. However, the decisions these system make often rely on components designed by domain experts, which can be difficult for non-technical end-users to understand or modify to their own ends. In this paper we propose a preliminary design for a flexible natural language interface for a task assignment system. The goal of our approach is both to grant users more control over a task assignment system's decision process, as well as render these decisions more transparent. Users can direct the task assignment system via natural language commands, which are applied as constraints to a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) using a large language model (LLM). Additionally, our proposed system can alert users to potential issues with their commands, and engage them in a corrective dialogue in order to find a viable solution. We conclude with a description of our planned user-evaluation in the simulated environment Overcooked and describe next steps towards developing a flexible and transparent task allocation system.

**ABSTRACT**  
State-of-the-art systems neuroscience experiments yield large-scale multimodal data, and these data sets require new tools for analysis. Inspired by the success of large pretrained models in vision and language domains, we reframe the analysis of large-scale, cellular-resolution neuronal spiking data into an autoregressive spatiotemporal generation problem. Neuroformer is a multimodal, multitask generative pretrained transformer (GPT) model that is specifically designed to handle the intricacies of data in systems neuroscience. It scales linearly with feature size, can process an arbitrary number of modalities, and is adaptable to downstream tasks, such as predicting behavior. We first trained Neuroformer on simulated datasets, and found that it both accurately predicted simulated neuronal circuit activity, and also intrinsically inferred the underlying neural circuit connectivity, including direction. When pretrained to decode neural responses, the model predicted the behavior of a mouse with only few-shot fine-tuning, suggesting that the model begins learning how to do so directly from the neural representations themselves, without any explicit supervision. We used an ablation study to show that joint training on neuronal responses and behavior boosted performance, highlighting the model's ability to associate behavioral and neural representations in an unsupervised manner. These findings show that Neuroformer can analyze neural datasets and their emergent properties, informing the development of models and hypotheses associated with the brain.

**ABSTRACT**  
The recent wave of generative AI has sparked unprecedented global attention, with both excitement and concern over potentially superhuman levels of artificial intelligence: models now take only seconds to produce outputs that would challenge or exceed the capabilities even of expert humans. At the same time, models still show basic errors in understanding that would not be expected even in non-expert humans. This presents us with an apparent paradox: how do we reconcile seemingly superhuman capabilities with the persistence of errors that few humans would make? In this work, we posit that this tension reflects a divergence in the configuration of intelligence in today's generative models relative to intelligence in humans. Specifically, we propose and test the Generative AI Paradox hypothesis: generative models, having been trained directly to reproduce expert-like outputs, acquire generative capabilities that are not contingent upon -- and can therefore exceed -- their ability to understand those same types of outputs. This contrasts with humans, for whom basic understanding almost always precedes the ability to generate expert-level outputs. We test this hypothesis through controlled experiments analyzing generation vs. understanding in generative models, across both language and image modalities. Our results show that although models can outperform humans in generation, they consistently fall short of human capabilities in measures of understanding, as well as weaker correlation between generation and understanding performance, and more brittleness to adversarial inputs. Our findings support the hypothesis that models' generative capability may not be contingent upon understanding capability, and call for caution in interpreting artificial intelligence by analogy to human intelligence.

**ABSTRACT**  
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are trained on vast amounts of data captured by humans emulating our understanding of the world. However, known as visual illusions, human's perception of reality isn't always faithful to the physical world. This raises a key question: do VLMs have the similar kind of illusions as humans do, or do they faithfully learn to represent reality? To investigate this question, we build a dataset containing five types of visual illusions and formulate four tasks to examine visual illusions in state-of-the-art VLMs. Our findings have shown that although the overall alignment is low, larger models are closer to human perception and more susceptible to visual illusions. Our dataset and initial findings will promote a better understanding of visual illusions in humans and machines and provide a stepping stone for future computational models that can better align humans and machines in perceiving and communicating about the shared visual world. The code and data are available at https://github.com/vl-illusion/dataset.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper provides policy recommendations to reduce extinction risks from advanced artificial intelligence (AI). First, we briefly provide background information about extinction risks from AI. Second, we argue that voluntary commitments from AI companies would be an inappropriate and insufficient response. Third, we describe three policy proposals that would meaningfully address the threats from advanced AI: (1) establishing a Multinational AGI Consortium to enable democratic oversight of advanced AI (MAGIC), (2) implementing a global cap on the amount of computing power used to train an AI system (global compute cap), and (3) requiring affirmative safety evaluations to ensure that risks are kept below acceptable levels (gating critical experiments). MAGIC would be a secure, safety-focused, internationally-governed institution responsible for reducing risks from advanced AI and performing research to safely harness the benefits of AI. MAGIC would also maintain emergency response infrastructure (kill switch) to swiftly halt AI development or withdraw model deployment in the event of an AI-related emergency. The global compute cap would end the corporate race toward dangerous AI systems while enabling the vast majority of AI innovation to continue unimpeded. Gating critical experiments would ensure that companies developing powerful AI systems are required to present affirmative evidence that these models keep extinction risks below an acceptable threshold. After describing these recommendations, we propose intermediate steps that the international community could take to implement these proposals and lay the groundwork for international coordination around advanced AI.

**ABSTRACT**  
Emotion recognition in conversations (ERC), the task of recognizing the emotion of each utterance in a conversation, is crucial for building empathetic machines. Existing studies focus mainly on capturing context- and speaker-sensitive dependencies on the textual modality but ignore the significance of multimodal information. Different from emotion recognition in textual conversations, capturing intra- and inter-modal interactions between utterances, learning weights between different modalities, and enhancing modal representations play important roles in multimodal ERC. In this paper, we propose a transformer-based model with self-distillation (SDT) for the task. The transformer-based model captures intra- and inter-modal interactions by utilizing intra- and inter-modal transformers, and learns weights between modalities dynamically by designing a hierarchical gated fusion strategy. Furthermore, to learn more expressive modal representations, we treat soft labels of the proposed model as extra training supervision. Specifically, we introduce self-distillation to transfer knowledge of hard and soft labels from the proposed model to each modality. Experiments on IEMOCAP and MELD datasets demonstrate that SDT outperforms previous state-of-the-art baselines.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recent technological advancements have led to a large number of patents in a diverse range of domains, making it challenging for human experts to analyze and manage. State-of-the-art methods for multi-label patent classification rely on deep neural networks (DNNs), which are complex and often considered black-boxes due to their opaque decision-making processes. In this paper, we propose a novel deep explainable patent classification framework by introducing layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) to provide human-understandable explanations for predictions. We train several DNN models, including Bi-LSTM, CNN, and CNN-BiLSTM, and propagate the predictions backward from the output layer up to the input layer of the model to identify the relevance of words for individual predictions. Considering the relevance score, we then generate explanations by visualizing relevant words for the predicted patent class. Experimental results on two datasets comprising two-million patent texts demonstrate high performance in terms of various evaluation measures. The explanations generated for each prediction highlight important relevant words that align with the predicted class, making the prediction more understandable. Explainable systems have the potential to facilitate the adoption of complex AI-enabled methods for patent classification in real-world applications.

**ABSTRACT**  
Artificially intelligent chatbot, such as ChatGPT, represents a recent and powerful advancement in the AI domain. Users prefer them for obtaining quick and precise answers, avoiding the usual hassle of clicking through multiple links in traditional searches. ChatGPT's conversational approach makes it comfortable and accessible for finding answers quickly and in an organized manner. However, it is important to note that these chatbots have limitations, especially in terms of providing accurate answers as well as ethical concerns. In this study, we explore various scenarios involving ChatGPT's ethical implications within academic contexts, its limitations, and the potential misuse by specific user groups. To address these challenges, we propose architectural solutions aimed at preventing inappropriate use and promoting responsible AI interactions.

**ABSTRACT**  
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the most momentous technologies of our time. Thus, it is of major importance to know which stakeholders influence AI research. Besides researchers at universities and colleges, researchers in companies have hardly been considered in this context. In this article, we consider how the influence of companies on AI research can be made measurable on the basis of scientific publishing activities. We compare academic- and company-authored AI publications published in the last decade and use scientometric data from multiple scholarly databases to look for differences across these groups and to disclose the top contributing organizations. While the vast majority of publications is still produced by academia, we find that the citation count an individual publication receives is significantly higher when it is (co-)authored by a company. Furthermore, using a variety of altmetric indicators, we notice that publications with company participation receive considerably more attention online. Finally, we place our analysis results in a broader context and present targeted recommendations to safeguard a harmonious balance between academia and industry in the realm of AI research.

In applied mathematics and related disciplines, the modeling-simulation-optimization workflow is a prominent scheme, with mathematical models and numerical algorithms playing a crucial role. For these types of mathematical research data, the Mathematical Research Data Initiative has developed, merged and implemented ontologies and knowledge graphs. This contributes to making mathematical research data FAIR by introducing semantic technology and documenting the mathematical foundations accordingly. Using the concrete example of microfracture analysis of porous media, it is shown how the knowledge of the underlying mathematical model and the corresponding numerical algorithms for its solution can be represented by the ontologies.

**ABSTRACT**  
The Multi-Modal Large Language Model (MLLM) refers to an extension of the Large Language Model (LLM) equipped with the capability to receive and infer multi-modal data. Spatial awareness stands as one of the crucial abilities of MLLM, encompassing diverse skills related to understanding spatial relationships among objects and between objects and the scene area. Industries such as autonomous driving, smart healthcare, robotics, virtual, and augmented reality heavily demand MLLM's spatial awareness capabilities. However, there exists a noticeable gap between the current spatial awareness capabilities of MLLM and the requirements set by human needs. To address this issue, this paper proposes using more precise spatial position information between objects to guide MLLM in providing more accurate responses to user-related inquiries. Specifically, for a particular multi-modal task, we utilize algorithms for acquiring geometric spatial information and scene graphs to obtain relevant geometric spatial information and scene details of objects involved in the query. Subsequently, based on this information, we direct MLLM to address spatial awareness-related queries posed by the user. Extensive experiments were conducted in benchmarks such as MME, MM-Vet, and other multi-modal large language models. The experimental results thoroughly confirm the efficacy of the proposed method in enhancing the spatial awareness tasks and associated tasks of MLLM.

**ABSTRACT**  
We propose a causal interpretation of self-attention in the Transformer neural network architecture. We interpret self-attention as a mechanism that estimates a structural equation model for a given input sequence of symbols (tokens). The structural equation model can be interpreted, in turn, as a causal structure over the input symbols under the specific context of the input sequence. Importantly, this interpretation remains valid in the presence of latent confounders. Following this interpretation, we estimate conditional independence relations between input symbols by calculating partial correlations between their corresponding representations in the deepest attention layer. This enables learning the causal structure over an input sequence using existing constraint-based algorithms. In this sense, existing pre-trained Transformers can be utilized for zero-shot causal-discovery. We demonstrate this method by providing causal explanations for the outcomes of Transformers in two tasks: sentiment classification (NLP) and recommendation.

**ABSTRACT**  
Food security, a global concern, necessitates precise and diverse data-driven solutions to address its multifaceted challenges. This paper explores the integration of AI foundation models across various food security applications, leveraging distinct data types, to overcome the limitations of current deep and machine learning methods. Specifically, we investigate their utilization in crop type mapping, cropland mapping, field delineation and crop yield prediction. By capitalizing on multispectral imagery, meteorological data, soil properties, historical records, and high-resolution satellite imagery, AI foundation models offer a versatile approach. The study demonstrates that AI foundation models enhance food security initiatives by providing accurate predictions, improving resource allocation, and supporting informed decision-making. These models serve as a transformative force in addressing global food security limitations, marking a significant leap toward a sustainable and secure food future.

**ABSTRACT**  
What are the functionals of the reward that can be computed and optimized exactly in Markov Decision Processes? In the finite-horizon, undiscounted setting, Dynamic Programming (DP) can only handle these operations efficiently for certain classes of statistics. We summarize the characterization of these classes for policy evaluation, and give a new answer for the planning problem. Interestingly, we prove that only generalized means can be optimized exactly, even in the more general framework of Distributional Reinforcement Learning (DistRL).DistRL permits, however, to evaluate other functionals approximately. We provide error bounds on the resulting estimators, and discuss the potential of this approach as well as its limitations.These results contribute to advancing the theory of Markov Decision Processes by examining overall characteristics of the return, and particularly risk-conscious strategies.

**ABSTRACT**  
Graph pooling methods have been widely used on downsampling graphs, achieving impressive results on multiple graph-level tasks like graph classification and graph generation. An important line called node dropping pooling aims at exploiting learnable scoring functions to drop nodes with comparatively lower significance scores. However, existing node dropping methods suffer from two limitations: (1) for each pooled node, these models struggle to capture long-range dependencies since they mainly take GNNs as the backbones; (2) pooling only the highest-scoring nodes tends to preserve similar nodes, thus discarding the affluent information of low-scoring nodes. To address these issues, we propose a Graph Transformer Pooling method termed GTPool, which introduces Transformer to node dropping pooling to efficiently capture long-range pairwise interactions and meanwhile sample nodes diversely. Specifically, we design a scoring module based on the self-attention mechanism that takes both global context and local context into consideration, measuring the importance of nodes more comprehensively. GTPool further utilizes a diversified sampling method named Roulette Wheel Sampling (RWS) that is able to flexibly preserve nodes across different scoring intervals instead of only higher scoring nodes. In this way, GTPool could effectively obtain long-range information and select more representative nodes. Extensive experiments on 11 benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of GTPool over existing popular graph pooling methods.

**ABSTRACT**  
We evaluated GPT-4 in a public online Turing Test. The best-performing GPT-4 prompt passed in 41% of games, outperforming baselines set by ELIZA (27%) and GPT-3.5 (14%), but falling short of chance and the baseline set by human participants (63%). Participants' decisions were based mainly on linguistic style (35%) and socio-emotional traits (27%), supporting the idea that intelligence is not sufficient to pass the Turing Test. Participants' demographics, including education and familiarity with LLMs, did not predict detection rate, suggesting that even those who understand systems deeply and interact with them frequently may be susceptible to deception. Despite known limitations as a test of intelligence, we argue that the Turing Test continues to be relevant as an assessment of naturalistic communication and deception. AI models with the ability to masquerade as humans could have widespread societal consequences, and we analyse the effectiveness of different strategies and criteria for judging humanlikeness.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey on online test-time adaptation (OTTA), a paradigm focused on adapting machine learning models to novel data distributions upon batch arrival. Despite the proliferation of OTTA methods recently, the field is mired in issues like ambiguous settings, antiquated backbones, and inconsistent hyperparameter tuning, obfuscating the real challenges and making reproducibility elusive. For clarity and a rigorous comparison, we classify OTTA techniques into three primary categories and subject them to benchmarks using the potent Vision Transformer (ViT) backbone to discover genuinely effective strategies. Our benchmarks span not only conventional corrupted datasets such as CIFAR-10/100-C and ImageNet-C but also real-world shifts embodied in CIFAR-10.1 and CIFAR-10-Warehouse, encapsulating variations across search engines and synthesized data by diffusion models. To gauge efficiency in online scenarios, we introduce novel evaluation metrics, inclusive of FLOPs, shedding light on the trade-offs between adaptation accuracy and computational overhead. Our findings diverge from existing literature, indicating: (1) transformers exhibit heightened resilience to diverse domain shifts, (2) the efficacy of many OTTA methods hinges on ample batch sizes, and (3) stability in optimization and resistance to perturbations are critical during adaptation, especially when the batch size is 1. Motivated by these insights, we pointed out promising directions for future research. The source code will be made available.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this paper we introduce a novel framework for trajectory prediction of geospatial sequences using GraphTransformers. When viewed across several sequences, we observed that a graph structure automatically emerges between different geospatial points that is often not taken into account for such sequence modeling tasks. We show that by leveraging this graph structure explicitly, geospatial trajectory prediction can be significantly improved. Our GraphTransformer approach improves upon state-of-the-art Transformer based baseline significantly on HURDAT, a dataset where we are interested in predicting the trajectory of a hurricane on a 6 hourly basis.

**ABSTRACT**  
Robustness, the ability of models to maintain performance in the face of perturbations, is critical for developing reliable NLP systems. Recent studies have shown promising results in improving the robustness of models through adversarial training and data augmentation. However, in machine translation, most of these studies have focused on bilingual machine translation with a single translation direction. In this paper, we investigate the transferability of robustness across different languages in multilingual neural machine translation. We propose a robustness transfer analysis protocol and conduct a series of experiments. In particular, we use character-, word-, and multi-level noises to attack the specific translation direction of the multilingual neural machine translation model and evaluate the robustness of other translation directions. Our findings demonstrate that the robustness gained in one translation direction can indeed transfer to other translation directions. Additionally, we empirically find scenarios where robustness to character-level noise and word-level noise is more likely to transfer.

**ABSTRACT**  
Autonomous vehicles need to accomplish their tasks while interacting with human drivers in traffic. It is thus crucial to equip autonomous vehicles with artificial reasoning to better comprehend the intentions of the surrounding traffic, thereby facilitating the accomplishments of the tasks. In this work, we propose a behavioral model that encodes drivers' interacting intentions into latent social-psychological parameters. Leveraging a Bayesian filter, we develop a receding-horizon optimization-based controller for autonomous vehicle decision-making which accounts for the uncertainties in the interacting drivers' intentions. For online deployment, we design a neural network architecture based on the attention mechanism which imitates the behavioral model with online estimated parameter priors. We also propose a decision tree search algorithm to solve the decision-making problem online. The proposed behavioral model is then evaluated in terms of its capabilities for real-world trajectory prediction. We further conduct extensive evaluations of the proposed decision-making module, in forced highway merging scenarios, using both simulated environments and real-world traffic datasets. The results demonstrate that our algorithms can complete the forced merging tasks in various traffic conditions while ensuring driving safety.

**ABSTRACT**  
In programming education, plagiarism and misuse of artificial intelligence (AI) assistance are emerging issues. However, not many relevant studies are focused on web programming. We plan to develop automated tools to help instructors identify both misconducts. To fully understand the issues, we conducted a controlled experiment to observe the unfair benefits and the characteristics. We compared student performance in completing web programming tasks independently, with a submission to plagiarize, and with the help of AI assistance (ChatGPT). Our study shows that students who are involved in such misconducts get comparable test marks with less completion time. Plagiarized submissions are similar to the independent ones except in trivial aspects such as color and identifier names. AI-assisted submissions are more complex, making them less readable. Students believe AI assistance could be useful given proper acknowledgment of the use, although they are not convinced with readability and correctness of the solutions.

**ABSTRACT**  
Quantum Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNNs) are robust candidates to model and predict future values in multivariate time series. However, the effective implementation of some QRNN models is limited by the need of mid-circuit measurements. Those increase the requirements for quantum hardware, which in the current NISQ era does not allow reliable computations. Emulation arises as the main near-term alternative to explore the potential of QRNNs, but existing quantum emulators are not dedicated to circuits with multiple intermediate measurements. In this context, we design a specific emulation method that relies on density matrix formalism. The mathematical development is explicitly provided as a compact formulation by using tensor notation. It allows us to show how the present and past information from a time series is transmitted through the circuit, and how to reduce the computational cost in every time step of the emulated network. In addition, we derive the analytical gradient and the Hessian of the network outputs with respect to its trainable parameters, with an eye on gradient-based training and noisy outputs that would appear when using real quantum processors. We finally test the presented methods using a novel hardware-efficient ansatz and three diverse datasets that include univariate and multivariate time series. Our results show how QRNNs can make accurate predictions of future values by capturing non-trivial patterns of input series with different complexities.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper addresses the Graph Matching problem, which consists of finding the best possible alignment between two input graphs, and has many applications in computer vision, network deanonymization and protein alignment. A common approach to tackle this problem is through convex relaxations of the NP-hard \emph{Quadratic Assignment Problem} (QAP).   Here, we introduce a new convex relaxation onto the unit simplex and develop an efficient mirror descent scheme with closed-form iterations for solving this problem. Under the correlated Gaussian Wigner model, we show that the simplex relaxation admits a unique solution with high probability. In the noiseless case, this is shown to imply exact recovery of the ground truth permutation. Additionally, we establish a novel sufficiency condition for the input matrix in standard greedy rounding methods, which is less restrictive than the commonly used `diagonal dominance' condition. We use this condition to show exact one-step recovery of the ground truth (holding almost surely) via the mirror descent scheme, in the noiseless setting. We also use this condition to obtain significantly improved conditions for the GRAMPA algorithm [Fan et al. 2019] in the noiseless setting.

**ABSTRACT**  
Communication and computation are traditionally treated as separate entities, allowing for individual optimizations. However, many applications focus on local information's functionality rather than the information itself. For such cases, harnessing interference for computation in a multiple access channel through digital over-the-air computation can notably increase the computation, as established by the ChannelComp method. However, the coding scheme originally proposed in ChannelComp may suffer from high computational complexity because it is general and is not optimized for specific modulation categories. Therefore, this study considers a specific category of digital modulations for over-the-air computations, QAM and PAM, for which we introduce a novel coding scheme called SumComp. Furthermore, we derive an MSE analysis for SumComp coding in the computation of the arithmetic mean function and establish an upper bound on the MAE for a set of nomographic functions. Simulation results affirm the superior performance of SumComp coding compared to traditional analog over-the-air computation and the original coding in ChannelComp approaches regarding both MSE and MAE over a noisy multiple access channel. Specifically, SumComp coding shows approximately $10$ dB improvements for computing arithmetic and geometric mean on the normalized MSE for low noise scenarios.

**ABSTRACT**  
A novel Physical Layer Security (PLS) framework is conceived for enhancing the security of the wireless communication systems by exploiting multi-domain polarization in Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems. We design a sophisticated key generation scheme based on multi-domain polarization, and the corresponding receivers. An in-depth analysis of the system's secrecy rate is provided, demonstrating the confidentiality of our approach in the presence of eavesdroppers having strong computational capabilities. More explicitly, our simulation results and theoretical analysis corroborate the advantages of the proposed scheme in terms of its bit error rate (BER), block error rate (BLER), and maximum achievable secrecy rate. Our findings indicate that the innovative PLS framework effectively enhances the security and reliability of wireless communication systems. For instance, in a $4\times4$ MIMO setup, the proposed PLS strategy exhibits an improvement of $2$dB compared to conventional MIMO, systems at a BLER of $2\cdot 10^{-5}$ while the eavesdropper's BLER reaches $1$.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recently, the emergence of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the paradigm of information retrieval (IR) applications, especially in web search. With their remarkable capabilities in generating human-like texts, LLMs have created enormous texts on the Internet. As a result, IR systems in the LLMs era are facing a new challenge: the indexed documents now are not only written by human beings but also automatically generated by the LLMs. How these LLM-generated documents influence the IR systems is a pressing and still unexplored question. In this work, we conduct a quantitative evaluation of different IR models in scenarios where both human-written and LLM-generated texts are involved. Surprisingly, our findings indicate that neural retrieval models tend to rank LLM-generated documents higher.We refer to this category of biases in neural retrieval models towards the LLM-generated text as the \textbf{source bias}. Moreover, we discover that this bias is not confined to the first-stage neural retrievers, but extends to the second-stage neural re-rankers. Then, we provide an in-depth analysis from the perspective of text compression and observe that neural models can better understand the semantic information of LLM-generated text, which is further substantiated by our theoretical analysis.We also discuss the potential server concerns stemming from the observed source bias and hope our findings can serve as a critical wake-up call to the IR community and beyond. To facilitate future explorations of IR in the LLM era, the constructed two new benchmarks and codes will later be available at \url{https://github.com/KID-22/LLM4IR-Bias}.

**ABSTRACT**  
Sequential recommendation is to predict the next item of interest for a user, based on her/his interaction history with previous items. In conventional sequential recommenders, a common approach is to model item sequences using discrete IDs, learning representations that encode sequential behaviors and reflect user preferences. Inspired by recent success in empowering large language models (LLMs) to understand and reason over diverse modality data (e.g., image, audio, 3D points), a compelling research question arises: ``Can LLMs understand and work with hidden representations from ID-based sequential recommenders?''.To answer this, we propose a simple framework, RecInterpreter, which examines the capacity of open-source LLMs to decipher the representation space of sequential recommenders. Specifically, with the multimodal pairs (\ie representations of interaction sequence and text narrations), RecInterpreter first uses a lightweight adapter to map the representations into the token embedding space of the LLM. Subsequently, it constructs a sequence-recovery prompt that encourages the LLM to generate textual descriptions for items within the interaction sequence. Taking a step further, we propose a sequence-residual prompt instead, which guides the LLM in identifying the residual item by contrasting the representations before and after integrating this residual into the existing sequence. Empirical results showcase that our RecInterpreter enhances the exemplar LLM, LLaMA, to understand hidden representations from ID-based sequential recommenders, especially when guided by our sequence-residual prompts. Furthermore, RecInterpreter enables LLaMA to instantiate the oracle items generated by generative recommenders like DreamRec, concreting the item a user would ideally like to interact with next. Codes are available at https://github.com/YangZhengyi98/RecInterpreter.

**ABSTRACT**  
Sequential recommendation aims to recommend the next item that matches a user's interest, based on the sequence of items he/she interacted with before. Scrutinizing previous studies, we can summarize a common learning-to-classify paradigm -- given a positive item, a recommender model performs negative sampling to add negative items and learns to classify whether the user prefers them or not, based on his/her historical interaction sequence. Although effective, we reveal two inherent limitations:(1) it may differ from human behavior in that a user could imagine an oracle item in mind and select potential items matching the oracle; and (2) the classification is limited in the candidate pool with noisy or easy supervision from negative samples, which dilutes the preference signals towards the oracle item. Yet, generating the oracle item from the historical interaction sequence is mostly unexplored. To bridge the gap, we reshape sequential recommendation as a learning-to-generate paradigm, which is achieved via a guided diffusion model, termed DreamRec.Specifically, for a sequence of historical items, it applies a Transformer encoder to create guidance representations. Noising target items explores the underlying distribution of item space; then, with the guidance of historical interactions, the denoising process generates an oracle item to recover the positive item, so as to cast off negative sampling and depict the true preference of the user directly. We evaluate the effectiveness of DreamRec through extensive experiments and comparisons with existing methods. Codes and data are open-sourced at https://github.com/YangZhengyi98/DreamRec.

**ABSTRACT**  
Academic Search is a timeless challenge that the field of Information Retrieval has been dealing with for many years. Even today, the search for academic material is a broad field of research that recently started working on problems like the COVID-19 pandemic. However, test collections and specialized data sets like CORD-19 only allow for system-oriented experiments, while the evaluation of algorithms in real-world environments is only available to researchers from industry. In LiLAS, we open up two academic search platforms to allow participating research to evaluate their systems in a Docker-based research environment. This overview paper describes the motivation, infrastructure, and two systems LIVIVO and GESIS Search that are part of this CLEF lab.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper presents a deep learning based approach to extract product comparison information out of user reviews on various e-commerce websites. Any comparative product review has three major entities of information: the names of the products being compared, the user opinion (predicate) and the feature or aspect under comparison. All these informing entities are dependent on each other and bound by the rules of the language, in the review. We observe that their inter-dependencies can be captured well using LSTMs. We evaluate our system on existing manually labeled datasets and observe out-performance over the existing Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) framework popular for this task.

**ABSTRACT**  
Explainable AI (XAI) aims to provide insight into opaque model reasoning to humans and as such is an interdisciplinary field by nature. In this paper, we interviewed 10 practitioners to understand the possible usability of training data attribution (TDA) explanations and to explore the design space of such an approach. We confirmed that training data quality is often the most important factor for high model performance in practice and model developers mainly rely on their own experience to curate data. End-users expect explanations to enhance their interaction with the model and do not necessarily prioritise but are open to training data as a means of explanation. Within our participants, we found that TDA explanations are not well-known and therefore not used. We urge the community to focus on the utility of TDA techniques from the human-machine collaboration perspective and broaden the TDA evaluation to reflect common use cases in practice.

**ABSTRACT**  
Embedding covert streams into a cover channel is a common approach to circumventing Internet censorship, due to censors' inability to examine encrypted information in otherwise permitted protocols (Skype, HTTPS, etc.). However, recent advances in machine learning (ML) enable detecting a range of anti-censorship systems by learning distinct statistical patterns hidden in traffic flows. Therefore, designing obfuscation solutions able to generate traffic that is statistically similar to innocuous network activity, in order to deceive ML-based classifiers at line speed, is difficult.   In this paper, we formulate a practical adversarial attack strategy against flow classifiers as a method for circumventing censorship. Specifically, we cast the problem of finding adversarial flows that will be misclassified as a sequence generation task, which we solve with Amoeba, a novel reinforcement learning algorithm that we design. Amoeba works by interacting with censoring classifiers without any knowledge of their model structure, but by crafting packets and observing the classifiers' decisions, in order to guide the sequence generation process. Our experiments using data collected from two popular anti-censorship systems demonstrate that Amoeba can effectively shape adversarial flows that have on average 94% attack success rate against a range of ML algorithms. In addition, we show that these adversarial flows are robust in different network environments and possess transferability across various ML models, meaning that once trained against one, our agent can subvert other censoring classifiers without retraining.

**ABSTRACT**  
Large language models pretrained on a huge amount of data capture rich knowledge and information in the training data. The ability of data memorization and regurgitation in pretrained language models, revealed in previous studies, brings the risk of data leakage. In order to effectively reduce these risks, we propose a framework DEPN to Detect and Edit Privacy Neurons in pretrained language models, partially inspired by knowledge neurons and model editing. In DEPN, we introduce a novel method, termed as privacy neuron detector, to locate neurons associated with private information, and then edit these detected privacy neurons by setting their activations to zero. Furthermore, we propose a privacy neuron aggregator dememorize private information in a batch processing manner. Experimental results show that our method can significantly and efficiently reduce the exposure of private data leakage without deteriorating the performance of the model. Additionally, we empirically demonstrate the relationship between model memorization and privacy neurons, from multiple perspectives, including model size, training time, prompts, privacy neuron distribution, illustrating the robustness of our approach.

**ABSTRACT**  
Existing machine learning research has achieved promising results in monaural audio-visual separation (MAVS). However, most MAVS methods purely consider what the sound source is, not where it is located. This can be a problem in VR/AR scenarios, where listeners need to be able to distinguish between similar audio sources located in different directions. To address this limitation, we have generalized MAVS to spatial audio separation and proposed LAVSS: a location-guided audio-visual spatial audio separator. LAVSS is inspired by the correlation between spatial audio and visual location. We introduce the phase difference carried by binaural audio as spatial cues, and we utilize positional representations of sounding objects as additional modality guidance. We also leverage multi-level cross-modal attention to perform visual-positional collaboration with audio features. In addition, we adopt a pre-trained monaural separator to transfer knowledge from rich mono sounds to boost spatial audio separation. This exploits the correlation between monaural and binaural channels. Experiments on the FAIR-Play dataset demonstrate the superiority of the proposed LAVSS over existing benchmarks of audio-visual separation. Our project page: https://yyx666660.github.io/LAVSS/.

**ABSTRACT**  
Artificial intelligence (AI) plays a pivotal role in various sectors, influencing critical decision-making processes in our daily lives. Within the AI landscape, novel AI paradigms, such as Federated Learning (FL), focus on preserving data privacy while collaboratively training AI models. In such a context, a group of experts from the European Commission (AI-HLEG) has identified sustainable AI as one of the key elements that must be considered to provide trustworthy AI. While existing literature offers several taxonomies and solutions for assessing the trustworthiness of FL models, a significant gap exists in considering sustainability and the carbon footprint associated with FL. Thus, this work introduces the sustainability pillar to the most recent and comprehensive trustworthy FL taxonomy, making this work the first to address all AI-HLEG requirements. The sustainability pillar assesses the FL system environmental impact, incorporating notions and metrics for hardware efficiency, federation complexity, and energy grid carbon intensity. Then, this work designs and implements an algorithm for evaluating the trustworthiness of FL models by incorporating the sustainability pillar. Extensive evaluations with the FederatedScope framework and various scenarios varying federation participants, complexities, hardware, and energy grids demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed solution.

**ABSTRACT**  
The accurate classification of student help requests with respect to the type of help being sought can enable the tailoring of effective responses. Automatically classifying such requests is non-trivial, but large language models (LLMs) appear to offer an accessible, cost-effective solution. This study evaluates the performance of the GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models for classifying help requests from students in an introductory programming class. In zero-shot trials, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 exhibited comparable performance on most categories, while GPT-4 outperformed GPT-3.5 in classifying sub-categories for requests related to debugging. Fine-tuning the GPT-3.5 model improved its performance to such an extent that it approximated the accuracy and consistency across categories observed between two human raters. Overall, this study demonstrates the feasibility of using LLMs to enhance educational systems through the automated classification of student needs.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this work, we investigate the performance of a joint sensing and communication (JSC) network consisting of multiple base stations (BSs) that cooperate through a fusion center (FC) to exchange information about the sensed environment while concurrently establishing communication links with a set of user equipments (UEs). Each BS within the network operates as a monostatic radar system, enabling comprehensive scanning of the monitored area and generating range-angle maps that provide information regarding the position of a group of heterogeneous objects. The acquired maps are subsequently fused in the FC. Then, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is employed to infer the category of the targets, e.g., pedestrians or vehicles, and such information is exploited by an adaptive clustering algorithm to group the detections originating from the same target more effectively. Finally, two multi-target tracking algorithms, the probability hypothesis density (PHD) filter and multi-Bernoulli mixture (MBM) filter, are applied to estimate the state of the targets. Numerical results demonstrated that our framework could provide remarkable sensing performance, achieving an optimal sub-pattern assignment (OSPA) less than 60 cm, while keeping communication services to UEs with a reduction of the communication capacity in the order of 10% to 20%. The impact of the number of BSs engaged in sensing is also examined, and we show that in the specific case study, 3 BSs ensure a localization error below 1 m.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper presents GreenCourier, a novel scheduling framework that enables the runtime scheduling of serverless functions across geographically distributed regions based on their carbon efficiencies. Our framework incorporates an intelligent scheduling strategy for Kubernetes and supports Knative as the serverless platform. To obtain real-time carbon information for different geographical regions, our framework supports multiple marginal carbon emissions sources such as WattTime and the Carbon-aware SDK. We comprehensively evaluate the performance of our framework using the Google Kubernetes Engine and production serverless function traces for scheduling functions across Spain, France, Belgium, and the Netherlands. Results from our experiments show that compared to other approaches, GreenCourier reduces carbon emissions per function invocation by an average of 13.25%.

**ABSTRACT**  
With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI), digital humans have attracted more and more attention and are expected to achieve a wide range of applications in several industries. Then, most of the existing digital humans still rely on manual modeling by designers, which is a cumbersome process and has a long development cycle. Therefore, facing the rise of digital humans, there is an urgent need for a digital human generation system combined with AI to improve development efficiency. In this paper, an implementation scheme of an intelligent digital human generation system with multimodal fusion is proposed. Specifically, text, speech and image are taken as inputs, and interactive speech is synthesized using large language model (LLM), voiceprint extraction, and text-to-speech conversion techniques. Then the input image is age-transformed and a suitable image is selected as the driving image. Then, the modification and generation of digital human video content is realized by digital human driving, novel view synthesis, and intelligent dressing techniques. Finally, we enhance the user experience through style transfer, super-resolution, and quality evaluation. Experimental results show that the system can effectively realize digital human generation.

**ABSTRACT**  
Space-based gravitational wave detection is one of the most anticipated gravitational wave (GW) detection projects in the next decade, which will detect abundant compact binary systems. However, the precise prediction of space GW waveforms remains unexplored. To solve the data processing difficulty in the increasing waveform complexity caused by detectors' response and second-generation time-delay interferometry (TDI 2.0), an interpretable pre-trained large model named CBS-GPT (Compact Binary Systems Waveform Generation with Generative Pre-trained Transformer) is proposed. For compact binary system waveforms, three models were trained to predict the waveforms of massive black hole binary (MBHB), extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), and galactic binary (GB), achieving prediction accuracies of 98%, 91%, and 99%, respectively. The CBS-GPT model exhibits notable interpretability, with its hidden parameters effectively capturing the intricate information of waveforms, even with complex instrument response and a wide parameter range. Our research demonstrates the potential of large pre-trained models in gravitational wave data processing, opening up new opportunities for future tasks such as gap completion, GW signal detection, and signal noise reduction.

**ABSTRACT**  
Machine learning (ML) is increasingly becoming a common tool in computational chemistry. At the same time, the rapid development of ML methods requires a flexible software framework for designing custom workflows. MLatom 3 is a program package designed to leverage the power of ML to enhance typical computational chemistry simulations and to create complex workflows. This open-source package provides plenty of choice to the users who can run simulations with the command line options, input files, or with scripts using MLatom as a Python package, both on their computers and on the online XACS cloud computing at XACScloud.com. Computational chemists can calculate energies and thermochemical properties, optimize geometries, run molecular and quantum dynamics, and simulate (ro)vibrational, one-photon UV/vis absorption, and two-photon absorption spectra with ML, quantum mechanical, and combined models. The users can choose from an extensive library of methods containing pre-trained ML models and quantum mechanical approximations such as AIQM1 approaching coupled-cluster accuracy. The developers can build their own models using various ML algorithms. The great flexibility of MLatom is largely due to the extensive use of the interfaces to many state-of-the-art software packages and libraries.
