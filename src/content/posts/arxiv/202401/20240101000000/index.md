**ABSTRACT**  
This work focuses on plant leaf disease classification and explores three crucial aspects: adversarial training, model explainability, and model compression. The models' robustness against adversarial attacks is enhanced through adversarial training, ensuring accurate classification even in the presence of threats. Leveraging explainability techniques, we gain insights into the model's decision-making process, improving trust and transparency. Additionally, we explore model compression techniques to optimize computational efficiency while maintaining classification performance. Through our experiments, we determine that on a benchmark dataset, the robustness can be the price of the classification accuracy with performance reductions of 3%-20% for regular tests and gains of 50%-70% for adversarial attack tests. We also demonstrate that a student model can be 15-25 times more computationally efficient for a slight performance reduction, distilling the knowledge of more complex models.

**ABSTRACT**  
We propose a new way to explain and to visualize neural network classification through a decomposition-based explainable AI (DXAI). Instead of providing an explanation heatmap, our method yields a decomposition of the image into class-agnostic and class-distinct parts, with respect to the data and chosen classifier. Following a fundamental signal processing paradigm of analysis and synthesis, the original image is the sum of the decomposed parts. We thus obtain a radically different way of explaining classification. The class-agnostic part ideally is composed of all image features which do not posses class information, where the class-distinct part is its complementary. This new visualization can be more helpful and informative in certain scenarios, especially when the attributes are dense, global and additive in nature, for instance, when colors or textures are essential for class distinction.

**ABSTRACT**  
Existing gait recognition benchmarks mostly include minor clothing variations in the laboratory environments, but lack persistent changes in appearance over time and space. In this paper, we propose the first in-the-wild benchmark CCGait for cloth-changing gait recognition, which incorporates diverse clothing changes, indoor and outdoor scenes, and multi-modal statistics over 92 days. To further address the coupling effect of clothing and viewpoint variations, we propose a hybrid approach HybridGait that exploits both temporal dynamics and the projected 2D information of 3D human meshes. Specifically, we introduce a Canonical Alignment Spatial-Temporal Transformer (CA-STT) module to encode human joint position-aware features, and fully exploit 3D dense priors via a Silhouette-guided Deformation with 3D-2D Appearance Projection (SilD) strategy. Our contributions are twofold: we provide a challenging benchmark CCGait that captures realistic appearance changes across an expanded and space, and we propose a hybrid framework HybridGait that outperforms prior works on CCGait and Gait3D benchmarks.

**ABSTRACT**  
Masked Image Modeling (MIM) arises as a promising option for Vision Transformers among various self-supervised learning (SSL) methods. The essence of MIM lies in token-wise masked patch predictions, with targets patchified from images; or generated by pre-trained tokenizers or models. We argue targets from the pre-trained models usually exhibit spatial inconsistency, which makes it excessively challenging for the model to follow to learn more discriminative representations. To mitigate the issue, we introduce a novel self-supervision signal based on Dynamic Token Morphing (DTM), which dynamically aggregates contextually related tokens. DTM can be generally applied to various SSL frameworks, yet we propose a simple MIM that employs DTM to effectively improve the performance barely introducing extra training costs. Our experiments on ImageNet-1K and ADE20K evidently demonstrate the superiority of our methods. Furthermore, the comparative evaluation of iNaturalist and Fine-grained Visual Classification datasets further validates the transferability of our method on various downstream tasks. Our code will be released publicly.

**ABSTRACT**  
The Swin Transformer image super-resolution reconstruction network only relies on the long-range relationship of window attention and shifted window attention to explore features. This mechanism has two limitations. On the one hand, it only focuses on global features while ignoring local features. On the other hand, it is only concerned with spatial feature interactions while ignoring channel features and channel interactions, thus limiting its non-linear mapping ability. To address the above limitations, this paper proposes enhanced Swin Transformer modules via alternating aggregation of local-global features. In the local feature aggregation stage, this paper introduces shift convolution to realize the interaction between local spatial information and channel information. This paper proposes a block sparse global perception module in the global feature aggregation stage. This module organizes the spatial information first, then sends the recombination information into a spatial gating unit to implement the further interaction of spatial and channel information. Then, a multi-scale self-attention module and a low-parameter residual channel attention module are introduced to realize information aggregation at different scales. Finally, the proposed network is validated on five publicly available datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed network outperforms the other state-of-the-art super-resolution networks.

**ABSTRACT**  
Occlusion presents a significant challenge in human pose estimation. The challenges posed by occlusion can be attributed to the following factors: 1) Data: The collection and annotation of occluded human pose samples are relatively challenging. 2) Feature: Occlusion can cause feature confusion due to the high similarity between the target person and interfering individuals. 3) Inference: Robust inference becomes challenging due to the loss of complete body structural information. The existing methods designed for occluded human pose estimation usually focus on addressing only one of these factors. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive framework DAG (Data, Attention, Graph) to address the performance degradation caused by occlusion. Specifically, we introduce the mask joints with instance paste data augmentation technique to simulate occlusion scenarios. Additionally, an Adaptive Discriminative Attention Module (ADAM) is proposed to effectively enhance the features of target individuals. Furthermore, we present the Feature-Guided Multi-Hop GCN (FGMP-GCN) to fully explore the prior knowledge of body structure and improve pose estimation results. Through extensive experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets for occluded human pose estimation, we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing methods. Code and data will be publicly available.

**ABSTRACT**  
$ $The synergy of language and vision models has given rise to Large Language and Vision Assistant models (LLVAs), designed to engage users in rich conversational experiences intertwined with image-based queries. These comprehensive multimodal models seamlessly integrate vision encoders with Large Language Models (LLMs), expanding their applications in general-purpose language and visual comprehension. The advent of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) heralds a new era in Artificial Intelligence (AI) assistance, extending the horizons of AI utilization. This paper takes a unique perspective on LMMs, exploring their efficacy in performing image classification tasks using tailored prompts designed for specific datasets. We also investigate the LLVAs zero-shot learning capabilities. Our study includes a benchmarking analysis across four diverse datasets: MNIST, Cats Vs. Dogs, Hymnoptera (Ants Vs. Bees), and an unconventional dataset comprising Pox Vs. Non-Pox skin images. The results of our experiments demonstrate the model's remarkable performance, achieving classification accuracies of 85\%, 100\%, 77\%, and 79\% for the respective datasets without any fine-tuning. To bolster our analysis, we assess the model's performance post fine-tuning for specific tasks. In one instance, fine-tuning is conducted over a dataset comprising images of faces of children with and without autism. Prior to fine-tuning, the model demonstrated a test accuracy of 55\%, which significantly improved to 83\% post fine-tuning. These results, coupled with our prior findings, underscore the transformative potential of LLVAs and their versatile applications in real-world scenarios.

**ABSTRACT**  
In the evolving field of machine learning, video generation has witnessed significant advancements with autoregressive-based transformer models and diffusion models, known for synthesizing dynamic and realistic scenes. However, these models often face challenges with prolonged inference times, even for generating short video clips such as GIFs. This paper introduces FlashVideo, a novel framework tailored for swift Text-to-Video generation. FlashVideo represents the first successful adaptation of the RetNet architecture for video generation, bringing a unique approach to the field. Leveraging the RetNet-based architecture, FlashVideo reduces the time complexity of inference from $\mathcal{O}(L^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(L)$ for a sequence of length $L$, significantly accelerating inference speed. Additionally, we adopt a redundant-free frame interpolation method, enhancing the efficiency of frame interpolation. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that FlashVideo achieves a $\times9.17$ efficiency improvement over a traditional autoregressive-based transformer model, and its inference speed is of the same order of magnitude as that of BERT-based transformer models.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this work, we consider the offline preference-based reinforcement learning problem. We focus on the two-phase learning approach that is prevalent in previous reinforcement learning from human preference works. We find a challenge in applying two-phase learning in the offline PBRL setting that the learned utility model can be too hard for the learning agent to optimize during the second learning phase. To overcome the challenge, we propose a two-phasing learning approach under behavior regularization through action clipping. The insight is that the state-actions which are poorly covered by the dataset can only provide limited information and increase the complexity of the problem in the second learning phase. Our method ignores such state-actions during the second learning phase to achieve higher learning efficiency. We empirically verify that our method has high learning efficiency on a variety of datasets in robotic control environments.

**ABSTRACT**  
Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) emerges as a promising paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs). However, a notable challenge in RLHF is overoptimization, where beyond a certain threshold, the pursuit of higher rewards leads to a decline in human preferences. In this paper, we observe the weakness of KL regularization which is commonly employed in existing RLHF methods to address overoptimization. To mitigate this limitation, we scrutinize the RLHF objective in the offline dataset and propose uncertainty-penalized RLHF (UP-RLHF), which incorporates uncertainty regularization during RL-finetuning. To enhance the uncertainty quantification abilities for reward models, we first propose a diverse low-rank adaptation (LoRA) ensemble by maximizing the nuclear norm of LoRA matrix concatenations. Then we optimize policy models utilizing penalized rewards, determined by both rewards and uncertainties provided by the diverse reward LoRA ensembles. Our experimental results, based on two real human preference datasets, showcase the effectiveness of diverse reward LoRA ensembles in quantifying reward uncertainty. Additionally, uncertainty regularization in UP-RLHF proves to be pivotal in mitigating overoptimization, thereby contributing to the overall performance.

**ABSTRACT**  
In the domain of multivariate forecasting, transformer models stand out as powerful apparatus, displaying exceptional capabilities in handling messy datasets from real-world contexts. However, the inherent complexity of these datasets, characterized by numerous variables and lengthy temporal sequences, poses challenges, including increased noise and extended model runtime. This paper focuses on reducing redundant information to elevate forecasting accuracy while optimizing runtime efficiency. We propose a novel transformer forecasting framework enhanced by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to tackle this challenge. The framework is evaluated by five state-of-the-art (SOTA) models and four diverse real-world datasets. Our experimental results demonstrate the framework's ability to minimize prediction errors across all models and datasets while significantly reducing runtime. From the model perspective, one of the PCA-enhanced models: PCA+Crossformer, reduces mean square errors (MSE) by 33.3% and decreases runtime by 49.2% on average. From the dataset perspective, the framework delivers 14.3% MSE and 76.6% runtime reduction on Electricity datasets, as well as 4.8% MSE and 86.9% runtime reduction on Traffic datasets. This study aims to advance various SOTA models and enhance transformer-based time series forecasting for intricate data.

**ABSTRACT**  
In order to fully harness the potential of machine learning, it is crucial to establish a system that renders the field more accessible and less daunting for individuals who may not possess a comprehensive understanding of its intricacies. The paper describes the design of a system that integrates AutoML, XAI, and synthetic data generation to provide a great UX design for users. The system allows users to navigate and harness the power of machine learning while abstracting its complexities and providing high usability. The paper proposes two novel classifiers, Logistic Regression Forest and Support Vector Tree, for enhanced model performance, achieving 96\% accuracy on a diabetes dataset and 93\% on a survey dataset. The paper also introduces a model-dependent local interpreter called MEDLEY and evaluates its interpretation against LIME, Greedy, and Parzen. Additionally, the paper introduces LLM-based synthetic data generation, library-based data generation, and enhancing the original dataset with GAN. The findings on synthetic data suggest that enhancing the original dataset with GAN is the most reliable way to generate synthetic data, as evidenced by KS tests, standard deviation, and feature importance. The authors also found that GAN works best for quantitative datasets.

**ABSTRACT**  
Analyzing connections between brain regions of interest (ROI) is vital to detect neurological disorders such as autism or schizophrenia. Recent advancements employ graph neural networks (GNNs) to utilize graph structures in brains, improving detection performances. Current methods use correlation measures between ROI's blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals to generate the graph structure. Other methods use the training samples to learn the optimal graph structure through end-to-end learning. However, implementing those methods independently leads to some issues with noisy data for the correlation graphs and overfitting problems for the optimal graph. In this work, we proposed Bargrain (balanced graph structure for brains), which models two graph structures: filtered correlation matrix and optimal sample graph using graph convolution networks (GCNs). This approach aims to get advantages from both graphs and address the limitations of only relying on a single type of structure. Based on our extensive experiment, Bargrain outperforms state-of-the-art methods in classification tasks on brain disease datasets, as measured by average F1 scores.

**ABSTRACT**  
Self-supervised learning is a popular and powerful method for utilizing large amounts of unlabeled data, for which a wide variety of training objectives have been proposed in the literature. In this study, we perform a Bayesian analysis of state-of-the-art self-supervised learning objectives, elucidating the underlying probabilistic graphical models in each class and presenting a standardized methodology for their derivation from first principles. The analysis also indicates a natural means of integrating self-supervised learning with likelihood-based generative models. We instantiate this concept within the realm of cluster-based self-supervised learning and energy models, introducing a novel lower bound which is proven to reliably penalize the most important failure modes. Furthermore, this newly proposed lower bound enables the training of a standard backbone architecture without the necessity for asymmetric elements such as stop gradients, momentum encoders, or specialized clustering layers - typically introduced to avoid learning trivial solutions. Our theoretical findings are substantiated through experiments on synthetic and real-world data, including SVHN, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100, thus showing that our objective function allows to outperform existing self-supervised learning strategies in terms of clustering, generation and out-of-distribution detection performance by a wide margin. We also demonstrate that GEDI can be integrated into a neural-symbolic framework to mitigate the reasoning shortcut problem and to learn higher quality symbolic representations thanks to the enhanced classification performance.

**ABSTRACT**  
The integration of sensorized vessels, enabling real-time data collection and machine learning-driven data analysis marks a pivotal advancement in the maritime industry. This transformative technology not only can enhance safety, efficiency, and sustainability but also usher in a new era of cost-effective and smart maritime transportation in our increasingly interconnected world. This study presents a deep learning-driven anomaly detection system augmented with interpretable machine learning models for identifying performance anomalies in an industrial sensorized vessel, called TUCANA. We Leverage a human-in-the-loop unsupervised process that involves utilizing standard and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) autoencoders augmented with interpretable surrogate models, i.e., random forest and decision tree, to add transparency and interpretability to the results provided by the deep learning models. The interpretable models also enable automated rule generation for translating the inference into human-readable rules. Additionally, the process also includes providing a projection of the results using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), which helps with a better understanding of the structure and relationships within the data and assessment of the identified anomalies. We empirically evaluate the system using real data acquired from the vessel TUCANA and the results involve achieving over 80% precision and 90% recall with the LSTM model used in the process. The interpretable models also provide logical rules aligned with expert thinking, and the t-SNE-based projection enhances interpretability. Our system demonstrates that the proposed approach can be used effectively in real-world scenarios, offering transparency and precision in performance anomaly detection.

**ABSTRACT**  
Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful technique for training intelligent agents, but understanding why these agents make specific decisions can be quite challenging. This lack of transparency in RL models has been a long-standing problem, making it difficult for users to grasp the reasons behind an agent's behaviour. Various approaches have been explored to address this problem, with one promising avenue being reward decomposition (RD). RD is appealing as it sidesteps some of the concerns associated with other methods that attempt to rationalize an agent's behaviour in a post-hoc manner. RD works by exposing various facets of the rewards that contribute to the agent's objectives during training. However, RD alone has limitations as it primarily offers insights based on sub-rewards and does not delve into the intricate cause-and-effect relationships that occur within an RL agent's neural model. In this paper, we present an extension of RD that goes beyond sub-rewards to provide more informative explanations. Our approach is centred on a causal learning framework that leverages information-theoretic measures for explanation objectives that encourage three crucial properties of causal factors: \emph{causal sufficiency}, \emph{sparseness}, and \emph{orthogonality}. These properties help us distill the cause-and-effect relationships between the agent's states and actions or rewards, allowing for a deeper understanding of its decision-making processes. Our framework is designed to generate local explanations and can be applied to a wide range of RL tasks with multiple reward channels. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that our approach offers more meaningful and insightful explanations for the agent's action selections.

**ABSTRACT**  
The Windows authentication infrastructure relies on the Local Security Authority (LSA) system, with its integral component being lsass.exe. Regrettably, this framework is not impervious, presenting vulnerabilities that attract threat actors with malicious intent. By exploiting documented vulnerabilities sourced from the CVE database or leveraging sophisticated tools such as mimikatz, adversaries can successfully compromise user password-address information.   In this comprehensive analysis, we delve into proactive measures aimed at fortifying the local authentication subsystem against potential threats. Moreover, we present empirical evidence derived from practical assessments of various defensive methodologies, including those articulated previously. This examination not only underscores the importance of proactive security measures but also assesses the practical efficacy of these strategies in real-world contexts.

**ABSTRACT**  
Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) outline the methods attackers use to exploit vulnerabilities. The interpretation of TTPs in the MITRE ATT&CK framework can be challenging for cybersecurity practitioners due to presumed expertise, complex dependencies, and inherent ambiguity. Meanwhile, advancements with Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to recent surge in studies exploring its uses in cybersecurity operations. This leads us to question how well encoder-only (e.g., RoBERTa) and decoder-only (e.g., GPT-3.5) LLMs can comprehend and summarize TTPs to inform analysts of the intended purposes (i.e., tactics) of a cyberattack procedure. The state-of-the-art LLMs have shown to be prone to hallucination by providing inaccurate information, which is problematic in critical domains like cybersecurity. Therefore, we propose the use of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to extract relevant contexts for each cyberattack procedure for decoder-only LLMs (without fine-tuning). We further contrast such approach against supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of encoder-only LLMs. Our results reveal that both the direct-use of decoder-only LLMs (i.e., its pre-trained knowledge) and the SFT of encoder-only LLMs offer inaccurate interpretation of cyberattack procedures. Significant improvements are shown when RAG is used for decoder-only LLMs, particularly when directly relevant context is found. This study further sheds insights on the limitations and capabilities of using RAG for LLMs in interpreting TTPs.

**ABSTRACT**  
Backdoor attacks in the traditional graph neural networks (GNNs) field are easily detectable due to the dilemma of confusing labels. To explore the backdoor vulnerability of GNNs and create a more stealthy backdoor attack method, a clean-label graph backdoor attack method(CGBA) in the node classification task is proposed in this paper. Differently from existing backdoor attack methods, CGBA requires neither modification of node labels nor graph structure. Specifically, to solve the problem of inconsistency between the contents and labels of the samples, CGBA selects poisoning samples in a specific target class and uses the label of sample as the target label (i.e., clean-label) after injecting triggers into the target samples. To guarantee the similarity of neighboring nodes, the raw features of the nodes are elaborately picked as triggers to further improve the concealment of the triggers. Extensive experiments results show the effectiveness of our method. When the poisoning rate is 0.04, CGBA can achieve an average attack success rate of 87.8%, 98.9%, 89.1%, and 98.5%, respectively.

**ABSTRACT**  
The extensive adoption of Self-supervised learning (SSL) has led to an increased security threat from backdoor attacks. While existing research has mainly focused on backdoor attacks in image classification, there has been limited exploration into their implications for object detection. In this work, we propose the first backdoor attack designed for object detection tasks in SSL scenarios, termed Object Transform Attack (SSL-OTA). SSL-OTA employs a trigger capable of altering predictions of the target object to the desired category, encompassing two attacks: Data Poisoning Attack (NA) and Dual-Source Blending Attack (DSBA). NA conducts data poisoning during downstream fine-tuning of the object detector, while DSBA additionally injects backdoors into the pre-trained encoder. We establish appropriate metrics and conduct extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness and utility of our proposed attack. Notably, both NA and DSBA achieve high attack success rates (ASR) at extremely low poisoning rates (0.5%). The results underscore the importance of considering backdoor threats in SSL-based object detection and contribute a novel perspective to the field.

**ABSTRACT**  
Large Language Models (LLMs) have proven powerful, but the risk of privacy leakage remains a significant concern. Traditional privacy-preserving methods, such as Differential Privacy and Homomorphic Encryption, are inadequate for black-box API-only settings, demanding either model transparency or heavy computational resources. We propose Prompt2Forget (P2F), the first framework designed to tackle the LLM local privacy challenge by teaching LLM to forget. The method involves decomposing full questions into smaller segments, generating fabricated answers, and obfuscating the model's memory of the original input. A benchmark dataset was crafted with questions containing privacy-sensitive information from diverse fields. P2F achieves zero-shot generalization, allowing adaptability across a wide range of use cases without manual adjustments. Experimental results indicate P2F's robust capability to obfuscate LLM's memory, attaining a forgetfulness score of around 90\% without any utility loss. This represents an enhancement of up to 63\% when contrasted with the naive direct instruction technique, highlighting P2F's efficacy in mitigating memory retention of sensitive information within LLMs. Our findings establish the first benchmark in the novel field of the LLM forgetting task, representing a meaningful advancement in privacy preservation in the emerging LLM domain.

**ABSTRACT**  
Despite technological advancements, the significance of interdisciplinary subjects like complex networks has grown. Exploring communication within these networks is crucial, with traffic becoming a key concern due to the expanding population and increased need for connections. Congestion tends to originate in specific network areas but quickly proliferates throughout. Consequently, understanding the transition from a flow-free state to a congested state is vital. Numerous studies have delved into comprehending the emergence and control of congestion in complex networks, falling into three general categories: soft strategies, hard strategies, and resource allocation strategies. This article introduces a routing algorithm leveraging reinforcement learning to address two primary objectives: congestion control and optimizing path length based on the shortest path algorithm, ultimately enhancing network throughput compared to previous methods. Notably, the proposed method proves effective not only in Barab\'asi-Albert scale-free networks but also in other network models such as Watts-Strogatz (small-world) and Erd\"os-R\'enyi (random network). Simulation experiment results demonstrate that, across various traffic scenarios and network topologies, the proposed method can enhance efficiency criteria by up to 30% while reducing maximum node congestion by five times.

We consider the problem of red teaming LLMs on elementary calculations and algebraic tasks to evaluate how various prompting techniques affect the quality of outputs. We present a framework to procedurally generate numerical questions and puzzles, and compare the results with and without the application of several red teaming techniques. Our findings suggest that even though structured reasoning and providing worked-out examples slow down the deterioration of the quality of answers, the gpt-3.5-turbo and gpt-4 models are not well suited for elementary calculations and reasoning tasks, also when being red teamed.

**ABSTRACT**  
As Large Language Models (LLMs) play an increasingly pivotal role in natural language processing applications, their safety concerns become critical areas of NLP research. This paper presents Safety and Over-Defensiveness Evaluation (SODE) benchmark: a collection of diverse safe and unsafe prompts with carefully designed evaluation methods that facilitate systematic evaluation, comparison, and analysis over 'safety' and 'over-defensiveness.' With SODE, we study a variety of LLM defense strategies over multiple state-of-the-art LLMs, which reveals several interesting and important findings, such as (a) the widely popular 'self-checking' techniques indeed improve the safety against unsafe inputs, but this comes at the cost of extreme over-defensiveness on the safe inputs, (b) providing a safety instruction along with in-context exemplars (of both safe and unsafe inputs) consistently improves safety and also mitigates undue over-defensiveness of the models, (c) providing contextual knowledge easily breaks the safety guardrails and makes the models more vulnerable to generating unsafe responses. Overall, our work reveals numerous such critical findings that we believe will pave the way and facilitate further research in improving the safety of LLMs.

This paper explores the use of open generative Large Language Models (LLMs) for annotation tasks in the social sciences. The study highlights the challenges associated with proprietary models, such as limited reproducibility and privacy concerns, and advocates for the adoption of open (source) models that can be operated on independent devices. Two examples of annotation tasks, sentiment analysis in tweets and identification of leisure activities in childhood aspirational essays are provided. The study evaluates the performance of different prompting strategies and models (neural-chat-7b-v3-2, Starling-LM-7B-alpha, openchat_3.5, zephyr-7b-alpha and zephyr-7b-beta).

**ABSTRACT**  
Large language models (LLMs) have made significant advancements in natural language processing and are concurrently extending the language ability to other modalities, such as speech and vision. Nevertheless, most of the previous work focuses on prompting LLMs with perception abilities like auditory comprehension, and the effective approach for augmenting LLMs with speech synthesis capabilities remains ambiguous. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive empirical exploration of boosting LLMs with the ability to generate speech, by combining pre-trained LLM LLaMA/OPT and text-to-speech synthesis model VALL-E. We compare three integration methods between LLMs and speech synthesis models, including directly fine-tuned LLMs, superposed layers of LLMs and VALL-E, and coupled LLMs and VALL-E using LLMs as a powerful text encoder. Experimental results show that, using LoRA method to fine-tune LLMs directly to boost the speech synthesis capability does not work well, and superposed LLMs and VALL-E can improve the quality of generated speech both in speaker similarity and word error rate (WER). Among these three methods, coupled methods leveraging LLMs as the text encoder can achieve the best performance, making it outperform original speech synthesis models with a consistently better speaker similarity and a significant (10.9%) WER reduction.

**ABSTRACT**  
Large Language Models produce sequences learned as statistical patterns from large corpora. In order not to reproduce corpus biases, after initial training models must be aligned with human values, preferencing certain continuations over others. Alignment, which can be viewed as the superimposition of normative structure onto a statistical model, reveals a conflicted and complex interrelationship between language and technology. This relationship shapes theories of language, linguistic practice and subjectivity, which are especially relevant to the current sophistication in artificially produced text. We examine this practice of structuration as a two-way interaction between users and models by analysing how ChatGPT4 redacts perceived `anomalous' language in fragments of Joyce's Ulysses and the new linguistic practice of prompt engineering. We then situate this alignment problem historically, revisiting earlier postwar linguistic debates which counterposed two views of meaning: as discrete structures, and as continuous probability distributions. We discuss the largely occluded work of the Moscow Linguistic School, which sought to reconcile this opposition. Our attention to the Moscow School and later related arguments by Searle and Kristeva casts the problem of alignment in a new light: as one involving attention to the social structuration of linguistic practice, including structuration of anomalies that, like the Joycean text, exist in defiance of expressive conventions. These debates around the communicative orientation toward language can help explain some of the contemporary behaviours and interdependencies that take place between users and LLMs.

**ABSTRACT**  
This work introduces the L3Cube-MahaSocialNER dataset, the first and largest social media dataset specifically designed for Named Entity Recognition (NER) in the Marathi language. The dataset comprises 18,000 manually labeled sentences covering eight entity classes, addressing challenges posed by social media data, including non-standard language and informal idioms. Deep learning models, including CNN, LSTM, BiLSTM, and Transformer models, are evaluated on the individual dataset with IOB and non-IOB notations. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of these models in accurately recognizing named entities in Marathi informal text. The L3Cube-MahaSocialNER dataset offers user-centric information extraction and supports real-time applications, providing a valuable resource for public opinion analysis, news, and marketing on social media platforms. We also show that the zero-shot results of the regular NER model are poor on the social NER test set thus highlighting the need for more social NER datasets.

**ABSTRACT**  
In open-domain Question Answering (QA), dense retrieval is crucial for finding relevant passages for answer generation. Typically, contrastive learning is used to train a retrieval model that maps passages and queries to the same semantic space. The objective is to make similar ones closer and dissimilar ones further apart. However, training such a system is challenging due to the false negative issue, where relevant passages may be missed during data annotation. Hard negative sampling, which is commonly used to improve contrastive learning, can introduce more noise in training. This is because hard negatives are those closer to a given query, and thus more likely to be false negatives. To address this issue, we propose a novel contrastive confidence regularizer for Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) loss, a commonly used loss for dense retrieval. Our analysis shows that the regularizer helps dense retrieval models be more robust against false negatives with a theoretical guarantee. Additionally, we propose a model-agnostic method to filter out noisy negative passages in the dataset, improving any downstream dense retrieval models. Through experiments on three datasets, we demonstrate that our method achieves better retrieval performance in comparison to existing state-of-the-art dense retrieval systems.

**ABSTRACT**  
Question Answering over Knowledge Graph (KGQA) aims to seek answer entities for the natural language question from a large-scale Knowledge Graph~(KG). To better perform reasoning on KG, recent work typically adopts a pre-trained language model~(PLM) to model the question, and a graph neural network~(GNN) based module to perform multi-hop reasoning on the KG. Despite the effectiveness, due to the divergence in model architecture, the PLM and GNN are not closely integrated, limiting the knowledge sharing and fine-grained feature interactions. To solve it, we aim to simplify the above two-module approach, and develop a more capable PLM that can directly support subgraph reasoning for KGQA, namely ReasoningLM. In our approach, we propose a subgraph-aware self-attention mechanism to imitate the GNN for performing structured reasoning, and also adopt an adaptation tuning strategy to adapt the model parameters with 20,000 subgraphs with synthesized questions. After adaptation, the PLM can be parameter-efficient fine-tuned on downstream tasks. Experiments show that ReasoningLM surpasses state-of-the-art models by a large margin, even with fewer updated parameters and less training data. Our codes and data are publicly available at~\url{https://github.com/RUCAIBox/ReasoningLM}.

**ABSTRACT**  
This work evaluated several cutting-edge large-scale foundation models based on self-supervision or weak supervision, including SeamlessM4T, SeamlessM4T v2, and Whisper-large-v3, on three code-switched corpora. We found that self-supervised models can achieve performances close to the supervised model, indicating the effectiveness of multilingual self-supervised pre-training. We also observed that these models still have room for improvement as they kept making similar mistakes and had unsatisfactory performances on modeling intra-sentential code-switching. In addition, the validity of several variants of Whisper was explored, and we concluded that they remained effective in a code-switching scenario, and similar techniques for self-supervised models are worth studying to boost the performance of code-switched tasks.

**ABSTRACT**  
Proactively and naturally guiding the dialog from the non-recommendation context (e.g., Chit-chat) to the recommendation scenario (e.g., Music) is crucial for the Conversational Recommender System (CRS). Prior studies mainly focus on planning the next dialog goal~(e.g., chat on a movie star) conditioned on the previous dialog. However, we find the dialog goals can be simultaneously observed at different levels, which can be utilized to improve CRS. In this paper, we propose Dual-space Hierarchical Learning (DHL) to leverage multi-level goal sequences and their hierarchical relationships for conversational recommendation. Specifically, we exploit multi-level goal sequences from both the representation space and the optimization space. In the representation space, we propose the hierarchical representation learning where a cross attention module derives mutually enhanced multi-level goal representations. In the optimization space, we devise the hierarchical weight learning to reweight lower-level goal sequences, and introduce bi-level optimization for stable update. Additionally, we propose a soft labeling strategy to guide optimization gradually. Experiments on two real-world datasets verify the effectiveness of our approach. Code and data are available here.

**ABSTRACT**  
Direct imaging of Earth-like exoplanets is one of the most prominent scientific drivers of the next generation of ground-based telescopes. Typically, Earth-like exoplanets are located at small angular separations from their host stars, making their detection difficult. Consequently, the adaptive optics (AO) system's control algorithm must be carefully designed to distinguish the exoplanet from the residual light produced by the host star.   A new promising avenue of research to improve AO control builds on data-driven control methods such as Reinforcement Learning (RL). RL is an active branch of the machine learning research field, where control of a system is learned through interaction with the environment. Thus, RL can be seen as an automated approach to AO control, where its usage is entirely a turnkey operation. In particular, model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) has been shown to cope with both temporal and misregistration errors. Similarly, it has been demonstrated to adapt to non-linear wavefront sensing while being efficient in training and execution.   In this work, we implement and adapt an RL method called Policy Optimization for AO (PO4AO) to the GHOST test bench at ESO headquarters, where we demonstrate a strong performance of the method in a laboratory environment. Our implementation allows the training to be performed parallel to inference, which is crucial for on-sky operation. In particular, we study the predictive and self-calibrating aspects of the method. The new implementation on GHOST running PyTorch introduces only around 700 microseconds in addition to hardware, pipeline, and Python interface latency. We open-source well-documented code for the implementation and specify the requirements for the RTC pipeline. We also discuss the important hyperparameters of the method, the source of the latency, and the possible paths for a lower latency implementation.

**ABSTRACT**  
When reasoning about actions, e.g., by means of task planning or agent programming with Golog, the robot's actions are typically modeled on an abstract level, where complex actions such as picking up an object are treated as atomic primitives with deterministic effects and preconditions that only depend on the current state. However, when executing such an action on a robot it can no longer be seen as a primitive. Instead, action execution is a complex task involving multiple steps with additional temporal preconditions and timing constraints. Furthermore, the action may be noisy, e.g., producing erroneous sensing results and not always having the desired effects. While these aspects are typically ignored in reasoning tasks, they need to be dealt with during execution. In this thesis, we propose several approaches towards closing this gap.

**ABSTRACT**  
Transportation has greatly benefited the cities' development in the modern civilization process. Intelligent transportation, leveraging advanced computer algorithms, could further increase people's daily commuting efficiency. However, intelligent transportation, as a cross-discipline, often requires practitioners to comprehend complicated algorithms and obscure neural networks, bringing a challenge for the advanced techniques to be trusted and deployed in practical industries. Recognizing the expressiveness of the pre-trained large language models, especially the potential of being augmented with abilities to understand and execute intricate commands, we introduce Open-TI. Serving as a bridge to mitigate the industry-academic gap, Open-TI is an innovative model targeting the goal of Turing Indistinguishable Traffic Intelligence, it is augmented with the capability to harness external traffic analysis packages based on existing conversations. Marking its distinction, Open-TI is the first method capable of conducting exhaustive traffic analysis from scratch - spanning from map data acquisition to the eventual execution in complex simulations. Besides, Open-TI is able to conduct task-specific embodiment like training and adapting the traffic signal control policies (TSC), explore demand optimizations, etc. Furthermore, we explored the viability of LLMs directly serving as control agents, by understanding the expected intentions from Open-TI, we designed an agent-to-agent communication mode to support Open-TI conveying messages to ChatZero (control agent), and then the control agent would choose from the action space to proceed the execution. We eventually provide the formal implementation structure, and the open-ended design invites further community-driven enhancements.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper explores the causal reasoning of large language models (LLMs) to enhance their interpretability and reliability in advancing artificial intelligence. Despite the proficiency of LLMs in a range of tasks, their potential for understanding causality requires further exploration. We propose a novel causal attribution model that utilizes "do-operators" for constructing counterfactual scenarios, allowing us to systematically quantify the influence of input numerical data and LLMs' pre-existing knowledge on their causal reasoning processes. Our newly developed experimental setup assesses LLMs' reliance on contextual information and inherent knowledge across various domains. Our evaluation reveals that LLMs' causal reasoning ability depends on the context and domain-specific knowledge provided, and supports the argument that "knowledge is, indeed, what LLMs principally require for sound causal reasoning". On the contrary, in the absence of knowledge, LLMs still maintain a degree of causal reasoning using the available numerical data, albeit with limitations in the calculations.

**ABSTRACT**  
Although planning is a crucial component of the autonomous driving stack, researchers have yet to develop robust planning algorithms that are capable of safely handling the diverse range of possible driving scenarios. Learning-based planners suffer from overfitting and poor long-tail performance. On the other hand, rule-based planners generalize well, but might fail to handle scenarios that require complex driving maneuvers. To address these limitations, we investigate the possibility of leveraging the common-sense reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT4 and Llama2 to generate plans for self-driving vehicles. In particular, we develop a novel hybrid planner that leverages a conventional rule-based planner in conjunction with an LLM-based planner. Guided by commonsense reasoning abilities of LLMs, our approach navigates complex scenarios which existing planners struggle with, produces well-reasoned outputs while also remaining grounded through working alongside the rule-based approach. Through extensive evaluation on the nuPlan benchmark, we achieve state-of-the-art performance, outperforming all existing pure learning- and rule-based methods across most metrics. Our code will be available at https://llmassist.github.io.

**ABSTRACT**  
The networked nature of multi-robot systems presents challenges in the context of multi-agent reinforcement learning. Centralized control policies do not scale with increasing numbers of robots, whereas independent control policies do not exploit the information provided by other robots, exhibiting poor performance in cooperative-competitive tasks. In this work we propose a physics-informed reinforcement learning approach able to learn distributed multi-robot control policies that are both scalable and make use of all the available information to each robot. Our approach has three key characteristics. First, it imposes a port-Hamiltonian structure on the policy representation, respecting energy conservation properties of physical robot systems and the networked nature of robot team interactions. Second, it uses self-attention to ensure a sparse policy representation able to handle time-varying information at each robot from the interaction graph. Third, we present a soft actor-critic reinforcement learning algorithm parameterized by our self-attention port-Hamiltonian control policy, which accounts for the correlation among robots during training while overcoming the need of value function factorization. Extensive simulations in different multi-robot scenarios demonstrate the success of the proposed approach, surpassing previous multi-robot reinforcement learning solutions in scalability, while achieving similar or superior performance (with averaged cumulative reward up to x2 greater than the state-of-the-art with robot teams x6 larger than the number of robots at training time).

**ABSTRACT**  
The author's goal in this paper is to explore how artificial intelligence (AI) has been utilised to inform our understanding of and ability to estimate at scale a critical aspect of musical creativity - musical tempo. The central importance of tempo to musical creativity can be seen in how it is used to express specific emotions (Eerola and Vuoskoski 2013), suggest particular musical styles (Li and Chan 2011), influence perception of expression (Webster and Weir 2005) and mediate the urge to move one's body in time to the music (Burger et al. 2014). Traditional tempo estimation methods typically detect signal periodicities that reflect the underlying rhythmic structure of the music, often using some form of autocorrelation of the amplitude envelope (Lartillot and Toiviainen 2007). Recently, AI-based methods utilising convolutional or recurrent neural networks (CNNs, RNNs) on spectral representations of the audio signal have enjoyed significant improvements in accuracy (Aarabi and Peeters 2022). Common AI-based techniques include those based on probability (e.g., Bayesian approaches, hidden Markov models (HMM)), classification and statistical learning (e.g., support vector machines (SVM)), and artificial neural networks (ANNs) (e.g., self-organising maps (SOMs), CNNs, RNNs, deep learning (DL)). The aim here is to provide an overview of some of the more common AI-based tempo estimation algorithms and to shine a light on notable benefits and potential drawbacks of each. Limitations of AI in this field in general are also considered, as is the capacity for such methods to account for idiosyncrasies inherent in tempo perception, i.e., how well AI-based approaches are able to think and act like humans.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this letter, we propose a deep-unfolding-based framework (DUNet) to maximize the secrecy rate in reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) empowered multi-user wireless networks. To tailor DUNet, first we relax the problem, decouple it into beamforming and phase shift subproblems, and propose an alternative optimization (AO) based solution for the relaxed problem. Second, we apply Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions to obtain a closed-form solutions for the beamforming and the phase shift. Using deep-unfolding mechanism, we transform the closed-form solutions into a deep learning model (i.e., DUNet) that achieves a comparable performance to that of AO in terms of accuracy and about 25.6 times faster.

**ABSTRACT**  
Incorporating symmetry as an inductive bias into multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has led to improvements in generalization, data efficiency, and physical consistency. While prior research has succeeded in using perfect symmetry prior, the realm of partial symmetry in the multi-agent domain remains unexplored. To fill in this gap, we introduce the partially symmetric Markov game, a new subclass of the Markov game. We then theoretically show that the performance error introduced by utilizing symmetry in MARL is bounded, implying that the symmetry prior can still be useful in MARL even in partial symmetry situations. Motivated by this insight, we propose the Partial Symmetry Exploitation (PSE) framework that is able to adaptively incorporate symmetry prior in MARL under different symmetry-breaking conditions. Specifically, by adaptively adjusting the exploitation of symmetry, our framework is able to achieve superior sample efficiency and overall performance of MARL algorithms. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed framework over baselines. Finally, we implement the proposed framework in real-world multi-robot testbed to show its superiority.

**ABSTRACT**  
Multi-agent systems often require agents to collaborate with or compete against other agents with diverse goals, behaviors, or strategies. Agent modeling is essential when designing adaptive policies for intelligent machine agents in multiagent systems, as this is the means by which the ego agent understands other agents' behavior and extracts their meaningful policy representations. These representations can be used to enhance the ego agent's adaptive policy which is trained by reinforcement learning. However, existing agent modeling approaches typically assume the availability of local observations from other agents (modeled agents) during training or a long observation trajectory for policy adaption. To remove these constrictive assumptions and improve agent modeling performance, we devised a Contrastive Learning-based Agent Modeling (CLAM) method that relies only on the local observations from the ego agent during training and execution. With these observations, CLAM is capable of generating consistent high-quality policy representations in real-time right from the beginning of each episode. We evaluated the efficacy of our approach in both cooperative and competitive multi-agent environments. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art on both cooperative and competitive tasks, highlighting the potential of contrastive learning-based agent modeling for enhancing reinforcement learning.

**ABSTRACT**  
We develop a new efficient sequential approximate leverage score algorithm, SALSA, using methods from randomized numerical linear algebra (RandNLA) for large matrices. We demonstrate that, with high probability, the accuracy of SALSA's approximations is within $(1 + O({\varepsilon}))$ of the true leverage scores. In addition, we show that the theoretical computational complexity and numerical accuracy of SALSA surpass existing approximations. These theoretical results are subsequently utilized to develop an efficient algorithm, named LSARMA, for fitting an appropriate ARMA model to large-scale time series data. Our proposed algorithm is, with high probability, guaranteed to find the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters for the true underlying ARMA model. Furthermore, it has a worst-case running time that significantly improves those of the state-of-the-art alternatives in big data regimes. Empirical results on large-scale data strongly support these theoretical results and underscore the efficacy of our new approach.
