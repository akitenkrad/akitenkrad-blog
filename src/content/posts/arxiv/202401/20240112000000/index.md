**ABSTRACT**  
Metal Additive Manufacturing (MAM) has reshaped the manufacturing industry, offering benefits like intricate design, minimal waste, rapid prototyping, material versatility, and customized solutions. However, its full industry adoption faces hurdles, particularly in achieving consistent product quality. A crucial aspect for MAM's success is understanding the relationship between process parameters and melt pool characteristics. Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) into MAM is essential. Traditional machine learning (ML) methods, while effective, depend on large datasets to capture complex relationships, a significant challenge in MAM due to the extensive time and resources required for dataset creation. Our study introduces a novel surprise-guided sequential learning framework, SurpriseAF-BO, signaling a significant shift in MAM. This framework uses an iterative, adaptive learning process, modeling the dynamics between process parameters and melt pool characteristics with limited data, a key benefit in MAM's cyber manufacturing context. Compared to traditional ML models, our sequential learning method shows enhanced predictive accuracy for melt pool dimensions. Further improving our approach, we integrated a Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Network (CTGAN) into our framework, forming the CT-SurpriseAF-BO. This produces synthetic data resembling real experimental data, improving learning effectiveness. This enhancement boosts predictive precision without requiring additional physical experiments. Our study demonstrates the power of advanced data-driven techniques in cyber manufacturing and the substantial impact of sequential AI and ML, particularly in overcoming MAM's traditional challenges.

**ABSTRACT**  
Innate values describe agents' intrinsic motivations, which reflect their inherent interests and preferences to pursue goals and drive them to develop diverse skills satisfying their various needs. The essence of reinforcement learning (RL) is learning from interaction based on reward-driven (such as utilities) behaviors, much like natural agents. It is an excellent model to describe the innate-values-driven (IV) behaviors of AI agents. Especially in multi-agent systems (MAS), building the awareness of AI agents to balance the group utilities and system costs and satisfy group members' needs in their cooperation is a crucial problem for individuals learning to support their community and integrate human society in the long term. This paper proposes a hierarchical compound intrinsic value reinforcement learning model -- innate-values-driven reinforcement learning termed IVRL to describe the complex behaviors of multi-agent interaction in their cooperation. We implement the IVRL architecture in the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC) environment and compare the cooperative performance within three characteristics of innate value agents (Coward, Neutral, and Reckless) through three benchmark multi-agent RL algorithms: QMIX, IQL, and QTRAN. The results demonstrate that by organizing individual various needs rationally, the group can achieve better performance with lower costs effectively.

**ABSTRACT**  
Quantization (Alistarh et al., 2017) is an important (stochastic) compression technique that reduces the volume of transmitted bits during each communication round in distributed model training. Suresh et al. (2022) introduce correlated quantizers and show their advantages over independent counterparts by analyzing distributed SGD communication complexity. We analyze the forefront distributed non-convex optimization algorithm MARINA (Gorbunov et al., 2022) utilizing the proposed correlated quantizers and show that it outperforms the original MARINA and distributed SGD of Suresh et al. (2022) with regard to the communication complexity. We significantly refine the original analysis of MARINA without any additional assumptions using the weighted Hessian variance (Tyurin et al., 2022), and then we expand the theoretical framework of MARINA to accommodate a substantially broader range of potentially correlated and biased compressors, thus dilating the applicability of the method beyond the conventional independent unbiased compressor setup. Extensive experimental results corroborate our theoretical findings.

**ABSTRACT**  
Urban mobility is on the cusp of transformation with the emergence of shared, connected, and cooperative automated vehicles. Yet, for them to be accepted by customers, trust in their punctuality is vital. Many pilot initiatives operate without a fixed schedule, thus enhancing the importance of reliable arrival time (AT) predictions. This study presents an AT prediction system for autonomous shuttles, utilizing separate models for dwell and running time predictions, validated on real-world data from five cities. Alongside established methods such as XGBoost, we explore the benefits of integrating spatial data using graph neural networks (GNN). To accurately handle the case of a shuttle bypassing a stop, we propose a hierarchical model combining a random forest classifier and a GNN. The results for the final AT prediction are promising, showing low errors even when predicting several stops ahead. Yet, no single model emerges as universally superior, and we provide insights into the characteristics of pilot sites that influence the model selection process. Finally, we identify dwell time prediction as the key determinant in overall AT prediction accuracy when autonomous shuttles are deployed in low-traffic areas or under regulatory speed limits. This research provides insights into the current state of autonomous public transport prediction models and paves the way for more data-informed decision-making as the field advances.

**ABSTRACT**  
Robust and performant controllers are essential for industrial applications. However, deriving controller parameters for complex and nonlinear systems is challenging and time-consuming. To facilitate automatic controller parametrization, this work presents a novel approach using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with N-dimensional B-spline geometries (BSGs). We focus on the control of parameter-variant systems, a class of systems with complex behavior which depends on the operating conditions. For this system class, gain-scheduling control structures are widely used in applications across industries due to well-known design principles. Facilitating the expensive controller parametrization task regarding these control structures, we deploy an DRL agent. Based on control system observations, the agent autonomously decides how to adapt the controller parameters. We make the adaptation process more efficient by introducing BSGs to map the controller parameters which may depend on numerous operating conditions. To preprocess time-series data and extract a fixed-length feature vector, we use a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks. Furthermore, this work contributes actor regularizations that are relevant to real-world environments which differ from training. Accordingly, we apply dropout layer normalization to the actor and critic networks of the truncated quantile critic (TQC) algorithm. To show our approach's working principle and effectiveness, we train and evaluate the DRL agent on the parametrization task of an industrial control structure with parameter lookup tables.

**ABSTRACT**  
The recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to the creation of many modular AI agents. These agents employ LLMs as zero-shot learners to perform sub-tasks in order to solve complex tasks set forth by human users. We propose an approach to enhance the robustness and performance of modular AI agents that utilize LLMs as zero-shot learners. Our iterative machine teaching method offers an efficient way to teach AI agents over time with limited human feedback, addressing the limit posed by the quality of zero-shot learning. We advocate leveraging the data traces from initial deployments and outputs or annotations from the zero-shot learners to train smaller and task-specific substitute models which can reduce both the monetary costs and environmental impact. Our machine teaching process avails human expertise to correct examples with a high likelihood of misannotations. Results on three tasks, common to conversational AI agents, show that close-to-oracle performance can be achieved with supervision on 20-70% of the dataset depending upon the complexity of the task and performance of zero-shot learners.

**ABSTRACT**  
Projected to impact 1.6 million people in the UK by 2040 and costing {\pounds}25 billion annually, dementia presents a growing challenge to society. This study, a pioneering effort to predict the translational potential of dementia research using machine learning, hopes to address the slow translation of fundamental discoveries into practical applications despite dementia's significant societal and economic impact. We used the Dimensions database to extract data from 43,091 UK dementia research publications between the years 1990-2023, specifically metadata (authors, publication year etc.), concepts mentioned in the paper, and the paper abstract. To prepare the data for machine learning we applied methods such as one hot encoding and/or word embeddings. We trained a CatBoost Classifier to predict if a publication will be cited in a future patent or clinical trial. We trained several model variations. The model combining metadata, concept, and abstract embeddings yielded the highest performance: for patent predictions, an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC) of 0.84 and 77.17% accuracy; for clinical trial predictions, an AUROC of 0.81 and 75.11% accuracy. The results demonstrate that integrating machine learning within current research methodologies can uncover overlooked publications, expediting the identification of promising research and potentially transforming dementia research by predicting real-world impact and guiding translational strategies.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper proposes a classification framework aimed at identifying correlations between job ad requirements and transversal skill sets, with a focus on predicting the necessary skills for individual job descriptions using a deep learning model. The approach involves data collection, preprocessing, and labeling using ESCO (European Skills, Competences, and Occupations) taxonomy. Hierarchical classification and multi-label strategies are used for skill identification, while augmentation techniques address data imbalance, enhancing model robustness. A comparison between results obtained with English-specific and multi-language sentence embedding models reveals close accuracy. The experimental case studies detail neural network configurations, hyperparameters, and cross-validation results, highlighting the efficacy of the hierarchical approach and the suitability of the multi-language model for the diverse European job market. Thus, a new approach is proposed for the hierarchical classification of transversal skills from job ads.

**ABSTRACT**  
Time series forecasting is crucial and challenging in the real world. The recent surge in interest regarding time series foundation models, which cater to a diverse array of downstream tasks, is noteworthy. However, existing methods often overlook the multi-scale nature of time series, an aspect crucial for precise forecasting. To bridge this gap, we propose HiMTM, a hierarchical multi-scale masked time series modeling method designed for long-term forecasting. Specifically, it comprises four integral components: (1) hierarchical multi-scale transformer (HMT) to capture temporal information at different scales; (2) decoupled encoder-decoder (DED) forces the encoder to focus on feature extraction, while the decoder to focus on pretext tasks; (3) multi-scale masked reconstruction (MMR) provides multi-stage supervision signals for pre-training; (4) cross-scale attention fine-tuning (CSA-FT) to capture dependencies between different scales for forecasting. Collectively, these components enhance multi-scale feature extraction capabilities in masked time series modeling and contribute to improved prediction accuracy. We conduct extensive experiments on 7 mainstream datasets to prove that HiMTM has obvious advantages over contemporary self-supervised and end-to-end learning methods. The effectiveness of HiMTM is further showcased by its application in the industry of natural gas demand forecasting.

**ABSTRACT**  
Graph neural networks (GNNs) have found widespread application in modeling graph data across diverse domains. While GNNs excel in scenarios where the testing data shares the distribution of their training counterparts (in distribution, ID), they often exhibit incorrect predictions when confronted with samples from an unfamiliar distribution (out-of-distribution, OOD). To identify and reject OOD samples with GNNs, recent studies have explored graph OOD detection, often focusing on training a specific model or modifying the data on top of a well-trained GNN. Despite their effectiveness, these methods come with heavy training resources and costs, as they need to optimize the GNN-based models on training data. Moreover, their reliance on modifying the original GNNs and accessing training data further restricts their universality. To this end, this paper introduces a method to detect Graph Out-of-Distribution At Test-time (namely GOODAT), a data-centric, unsupervised, and plug-and-play solution that operates independently of training data and modifications of GNN architecture. With a lightweight graph masker, GOODAT can learn informative subgraphs from test samples, enabling the capture of distinct graph patterns between OOD and ID samples. To optimize the graph masker, we meticulously design three unsupervised objective functions based on the graph information bottleneck principle, motivating the masker to capture compact yet informative subgraphs for OOD detection. Comprehensive evaluations confirm that our GOODAT method outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks across a variety of real-world datasets.

**ABSTRACT**  
To handle the complexities of irregular and incomplete time series data, we propose an invertible solution of Neural Differential Equations (NDE)-based method. While NDE-based methods are a powerful method for analyzing irregularly-sampled time series, they typically do not guarantee reversible transformations in their standard form. Our method suggests the variation of Neural Controlled Differential Equations (Neural CDEs) with Neural Flow, which ensures invertibility while maintaining a lower computational burden. Additionally, it enables the training of a dual latent space, enhancing the modeling of dynamic temporal dynamics. Our research presents an advanced framework that excels in both classification and interpolation tasks. At the core of our approach is an enhanced dual latent states architecture, carefully designed for high precision across various time series tasks. Empirical analysis demonstrates that our method significantly outperforms existing models. This work significantly advances irregular time series analysis, introducing innovative techniques and offering a versatile tool for diverse practical applications.

**ABSTRACT**  
We propose a novel contrastive learning framework to effectively address the challenges of data heterogeneity in federated learning. We first analyze the inconsistency of gradient updates across clients during local training and establish its dependence on the distribution of feature representations, leading to the derivation of the supervised contrastive learning (SCL) objective to mitigate local deviations. In addition, we show that a na\"ive adoption of SCL in federated learning leads to representation collapse, resulting in slow convergence and limited performance gains. To address this issue, we introduce a relaxed contrastive learning loss that imposes a divergence penalty on excessively similar sample pairs within each class. This strategy prevents collapsed representations and enhances feature transferability, facilitating collaborative training and leading to significant performance improvements. Our framework outperforms all existing federated learning approaches by huge margins on the standard benchmarks through extensive experimental results.

**ABSTRACT**  
Currently, Amazon relies on third parties for transportation marketplace rate forecasts, despite the poor quality and lack of interpretability of these forecasts. While transportation marketplace rates are typically very challenging to forecast accurately, we have developed a novel signature-based statistical technique to address these challenges and built a predictive and adaptive model to forecast marketplace rates. This novel technique is based on two key properties of the signature transform. The first is its universal nonlinearity which linearizes the feature space and hence translates the forecasting problem into a linear regression analysis; the second is the signature kernel which allows for comparing computationally efficiently similarities between time series data. Combined, these properties allow for efficient feature generation and more precise identification of seasonality and regime switching in the forecasting process. Preliminary result by the model shows that this new technique leads to far superior forecast accuracy versus commercially available industry models with better interpretability, even during the period of Covid-19 and with the sudden onset of the Ukraine war.

**ABSTRACT**  
Humans are capable of strategically deceptive behavior: behaving helpfully in most situations, but then behaving very differently in order to pursue alternative objectives when given the opportunity. If an AI system learned such a deceptive strategy, could we detect it and remove it using current state-of-the-art safety training techniques? To study this question, we construct proof-of-concept examples of deceptive behavior in large language models (LLMs). For example, we train models that write secure code when the prompt states that the year is 2023, but insert exploitable code when the stated year is 2024. We find that such backdoor behavior can be made persistent, so that it is not removed by standard safety training techniques, including supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and adversarial training (eliciting unsafe behavior and then training to remove it). The backdoor behavior is most persistent in the largest models and in models trained to produce chain-of-thought reasoning about deceiving the training process, with the persistence remaining even when the chain-of-thought is distilled away. Furthermore, rather than removing backdoors, we find that adversarial training can teach models to better recognize their backdoor triggers, effectively hiding the unsafe behavior. Our results suggest that, once a model exhibits deceptive behavior, standard techniques could fail to remove such deception and create a false impression of safety.

**ABSTRACT**  
Large language models (LLMs), exemplified by ChatGPT, have gained considerable attention for their excellent natural language processing capabilities. Nonetheless, these LLMs present many challenges, particularly in the realm of trustworthiness. Therefore, ensuring the trustworthiness of LLMs emerges as an important topic. This paper introduces TrustLLM, a comprehensive study of trustworthiness in LLMs, including principles for different dimensions of trustworthiness, established benchmark, evaluation, and analysis of trustworthiness for mainstream LLMs, and discussion of open challenges and future directions. Specifically, we first propose a set of principles for trustworthy LLMs that span eight different dimensions. Based on these principles, we further establish a benchmark across six dimensions including truthfulness, safety, fairness, robustness, privacy, and machine ethics. We then present a study evaluating 16 mainstream LLMs in TrustLLM, consisting of over 30 datasets. Our findings firstly show that in general trustworthiness and utility (i.e., functional effectiveness) are positively related. Secondly, our observations reveal that proprietary LLMs generally outperform most open-source counterparts in terms of trustworthiness, raising concerns about the potential risks of widely accessible open-source LLMs. However, a few open-source LLMs come very close to proprietary ones. Thirdly, it is important to note that some LLMs may be overly calibrated towards exhibiting trustworthiness, to the extent that they compromise their utility by mistakenly treating benign prompts as harmful and consequently not responding. Finally, we emphasize the importance of ensuring transparency not only in the models themselves but also in the technologies that underpin trustworthiness. Knowing the specific trustworthy technologies that have been employed is crucial for analyzing their effectiveness.

**ABSTRACT**  
\textbf{Objectives}: We aimed to investigate how errors from automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems affect dementia classification accuracy, specifically in the ``Cookie Theft'' picture description task. We aimed to assess whether imperfect ASR-generated transcripts could provide valuable information for distinguishing between language samples from cognitively healthy individuals and those with Alzheimer's disease (AD).   \textbf{Methods}: We conducted experiments using various ASR models, refining their transcripts with post-editing techniques. Both these imperfect ASR transcripts and manually transcribed ones were used as inputs for the downstream dementia classification. We conducted comprehensive error analysis to compare model performance and assess ASR-generated transcript effectiveness in dementia classification.   \textbf{Results}: Imperfect ASR-generated transcripts surprisingly outperformed manual transcription for distinguishing between individuals with AD and those without in the ``Cookie Theft'' task. These ASR-based models surpassed the previous state-of-the-art approach, indicating that ASR errors may contain valuable cues related to dementia. The synergy between ASR and classification models improved overall accuracy in dementia classification.   \textbf{Conclusion}: Imperfect ASR transcripts effectively capture linguistic anomalies linked to dementia, improving accuracy in classification tasks. This synergy between ASR and classification models underscores ASR's potential as a valuable tool in assessing cognitive impairment and related clinical applications.

**ABSTRACT**  
Researchers have explored the potential of utilizing pre-trained language models, such as CodeBERT, to improve source code-related tasks. Previous studies have mainly relied on CodeBERT's text embedding capability and the `[CLS]' sentence embedding information as semantic representations for fine-tuning downstream source code-related tasks. However, these methods require additional neural network layers to extract effective features, resulting in higher computational costs. Furthermore, existing approaches have not leveraged the rich knowledge contained in both source code and related text, which can lead to lower accuracy. This paper presents a novel approach, CodePrompt, which utilizes rich knowledge recalled from a pre-trained model by prompt learning and an attention mechanism to improve source code-related classification tasks. Our approach initially motivates the language model with prompt information to retrieve abundant knowledge associated with the input as representative features, thus avoiding the need for additional neural network layers and reducing computational costs. Subsequently, we employ an attention mechanism to aggregate multiple layers of related knowledge for each task as final features to boost their accuracy. We conducted extensive experiments on four downstream source code-related tasks to evaluate our approach and our results demonstrate that CodePrompt achieves new state-of-the-art performance on the accuracy metric while also exhibiting computation cost-saving capabilities.

**ABSTRACT**  
Large language models (LLMs) have made significant progress in code generation tasks, but their performance in tackling programming problems with complex data structures and algorithms remains suboptimal. To address this issue, we propose an in-context learning approach that guides LLMs to debug by using a "print debugging" method, which involves inserting print statements to trace and analysing logs for fixing the bug. We collect a Leetcode problem dataset and evaluate our method using the Leetcode online judging system. Experiments with GPT-4 demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, outperforming rubber duck debugging in easy and medium-level Leetcode problems by 1.5% and 17.9%.

**ABSTRACT**  
Statements involving metalinguistic self-reference ("This paper has six sections.") are prevalent in many domains. Can large language models (LLMs) handle such language? In this paper, we present "I am a Strange Dataset", a new dataset for addressing this question. There are two subtasks: generation and verification. In generation, models continue statements like "The penultimate word in this sentence is" (where a correct continuation is "is"). In verification, models judge the truth of statements like "The penultimate word in this sentence is sentence." (false). We also provide minimally different metalinguistic non-self-reference examples to complement the main dataset by probing for whether models can handle metalinguistic language at all. The dataset is hand-crafted by experts and validated by non-expert annotators. We test a variety of open-source LLMs (7B to 70B parameters) as well as closed-source LLMs through APIs. All models perform close to chance across both subtasks and even on the non-self-referential metalinguistic control data, though we find some steady improvement with model scale. GPT 4 is the only model to consistently do significantly better than chance, and it is still only in the 60% range, while our untrained human annotators score well in the 89-93% range. The dataset and evaluation toolkit are available at https://github.com/TristanThrush/i-am-a-strange-dataset.

**ABSTRACT**  
Language agents have achieved considerable performance on various complex tasks. Despite the incessant exploration in this field, existing language agent systems still struggle with costly, non-reproducible data reliance and face the challenge of compelling a single model for multiple functions. To this end, we introduce AutoAct, an automatic agent learning framework that does not rely on large-scale annotated data and synthetic trajectories from closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4). Given limited data with a tool library, AutoAct first automatically synthesizes planning trajectories without any assistance from humans or strong closed-source models. Then, AutoAct leverages a division-of-labor strategy to automatically differentiate based on the target task information and synthesized trajectories, producing a sub-agent group to complete the task. We conduct comprehensive experiments with different LLMs, which demonstrates that AutoAct yields better or parallel performance compared to various strong baselines. We even notice that AutoAct, when using the Llama-2-13b model, can achieve performance comparable to that of the GPT-3.5-Turbo agent. Code will be available at https://github.com/zjunlp/AutoAct.

**ABSTRACT**  
Financial sentiment analysis refers to classifying financial text contents into sentiment categories (e.g. positive, negative, and neutral). In this paper, we focus on the classification of financial news title, which is a challenging task due to a lack of large amount of training samples. To overcome this difficulty, we propose to adapt the pretrained large language models (LLMs) [1, 2, 3] to solve this problem. The LLMs, which are trained from huge amount of text corpora,have an advantage in text understanding and can be effectively adapted to domain-specific task while requiring very few amount of training samples. In particular, we adapt the open-source Llama2-7B model (2023) with the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) technique [4]. Experimental evaluation shows that even with the 7B model (which is relatively small for LLMs), our approach significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art algorithms.

**ABSTRACT**  
Automatic food recipe generation methods provide a creative tool for chefs to explore and to create new, and interesting culinary delights. Given the recent success of large language models (LLMs), they have the potential to create new recipes that can meet individual preferences, dietary constraints, and adapt to what is in your refrigerator. Existing research on using LLMs to generate recipes has shown that LLMs can be finetuned to generate realistic-sounding recipes. However, on close examination, these generated recipes often fail to meet basic requirements like including chicken as an ingredient in chicken dishes. In this paper, we propose RecipeMC, a text generation method using GPT-2 that relies on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). RecipeMC allows us to define reward functions to put soft constraints on text generation and thus improve the credibility of the generated recipes. Our results show that human evaluators prefer recipes generated with RecipeMC more often than recipes generated with other baseline methods when compared with real recipes.

**ABSTRACT**  
Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in various reasoning benchmarks with the emergence of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and its derivative methods, particularly in tasks involving multi-choice questions (MCQs). However, current works all process data uniformly without considering the problem-solving difficulty, which means an excessive focus on simple questions while insufficient to intricate ones. To address this challenge, we inspired by humans using heuristic strategies to categorize tasks and handle them individually, propose to apply the Divide and Conquer to LLMs reasoning. First, we divide questions into different subsets based on the statistical confidence score ($\mathcal{CS}$), then fix nearly resolved sets and conquer demanding nuanced process ones with elaborately designed methods, including Prior Knowledge based Reasoning (PKR) and Filter Choices based Reasoning (FCR), as well as their integration variants. Our experiments demonstrate that this proposed strategy significantly boosts the models' reasoning abilities across nine datasets involving arithmetic, commonsense, and logic tasks. For instance, compared to baseline, we make a striking improvement on low confidence subsets of 8.72\% for AQuA, 15.07\% for ARC Challenge and 7.71\% for RiddleSense. In addition, through extensive analysis on length of rationale and number of options, we verify that longer reasoning paths in PKR could prevent models from referring infer-harmful shortcuts, and also find that removing irrelevant choices in FCR would substantially avoid models' confusion.

**ABSTRACT**  
Inspired by the increasing interest in leveraging large language models for translation, this paper evaluates the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) represented by ChatGPT in comparison to the mainstream neural machine translation (NMT) engines in translating Chinese diplomatic texts into English. Specifically, we examine the translation quality of ChatGPT and NMT engines as measured by four automated metrics and human evaluation based on an error-typology and six analytic rubrics. Our findings show that automated metrics yield similar results for ChatGPT under different prompts and NMT systems, while human annotators tend to assign noticeably higher scores to ChatGPT when it is provided an example or contextual information about the translation task. Pairwise correlation between automated metrics and dimensions of human evaluation produces weak and non-significant results, suggesting the divergence between the two methods of translation quality assessment. These findings provide valuable insights into the potential of ChatGPT as a capable machine translator, and the influence of prompt engineering on its performance.

**ABSTRACT**  
Although large language models (LLMs) have shown surprising language understanding and generation capabilities, they have yet to gain a revolutionary advancement in the field of machine translation. One potential cause of the limited performance is the misalignment between the translation-specific understanding and general understanding inside LLMs. To align the translation-specific understanding to the general one, we propose a novel translation process xIoD (Cross-Lingual Interpretation of Difficult words), explicitly incorporating the general understanding on the content incurring inconsistent understanding to guide the translation. Specifically, xIoD performs the cross-lingual interpretation for the difficult-to-translate words and enhances the translation with the generated interpretations. Furthermore, we reframe the external tools of QE to tackle the challenges of xIoD in the detection of difficult words and the generation of helpful interpretations. We conduct experiments on the self-constructed benchmark ChallengeMT, which includes cases in which multiple SOTA translation systems consistently underperform. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our xIoD, which improves up to +3.85 COMET.

**ABSTRACT**  
Large language models (LLMs) are powerful dialogue agents, but specializing them towards fulfilling a specific function can be challenging. Instructing tuning, i.e. tuning models on instruction and sample responses generated by humans (Ouyang et al., 2022), has proven as an effective method to do so, yet requires a number of data samples that a) might not be available or b) costly to generate. Furthermore, this cost increases when the goal is to make the LLM follow a specific workflow within a dialogue instead of single instructions. Inspired by the self-play technique in reinforcement learning and the use of LLMs to simulate human agents, we propose a more effective method for data collection through LLMs engaging in a conversation in various roles. This approach generates a training data via "self-talk" of LLMs that can be refined and utilized for supervised fine-tuning. We introduce an automated way to measure the (partial) success of a dialogue. This metric is used to filter the generated conversational data that is fed back in LLM for training. Based on our automated and human evaluations of conversation quality, we demonstrate that such self-talk data improves results. In addition, we examine the various characteristics that showcase the quality of generated dialogues and how they can be connected to their potential utility as training data.

**ABSTRACT**  
Machine translation often suffers from biased data and algorithms that can lead to unacceptable errors in system output. While bias in gender norms has been investigated, less is known about whether MT systems encode bias about social relationships, e.g. sentences such as "the lawyer kissed her wife." We investigate the degree of bias against same-gender relationships in MT systems, using generated template sentences drawn from several noun-gender languages (e.g. Spanish). We find that three popular MT services consistently fail to accurately translate sentences concerning relationships between nouns of the same gender. The error rate varies considerably based on the context, e.g. same-gender sentences referencing high female-representation occupations are translated with lower accuracy. We provide this work as a case study in the evaluation of intrinsic bias in NLP systems, with respect to social relationships.

**ABSTRACT**  
Some argue that the essence of humanity, such as creativity and sentiment, can never be mimicked by machines. This paper casts doubt on this belief by studying a vital question: Can AI compose poetry as well as humans? To answer the question, we propose ProFTAP, a novel evaluation framework inspired by Turing test to assess AI's poetry writing capability. We apply it on current large language models (LLMs) and find that recent LLMs do indeed possess the ability to write classical Chinese poems nearly indistinguishable from those of humans. We also reveal that various open-source LLMs can outperform GPT-4 on this task.

**ABSTRACT**  
Chain of Thought (CoT) is significant in improving the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). However, the correlation between the effectiveness of CoT and the length of reasoning steps in prompts remains largely unknown. To shed light on this, we have conducted several empirical experiments to explore the relations. Specifically, we design experiments that expand and compress the rationale reasoning steps within CoT demonstrations, while keeping all other factors constant. We have the following key findings. First, the results indicate that lengthening the reasoning steps in prompts, even without adding new information into the prompt, considerably enhances LLMs' reasoning abilities across multiple datasets. Alternatively, shortening the reasoning steps, even while preserving the key information, significantly diminishes the reasoning abilities of models. This finding highlights the importance of the number of steps in CoT prompts and provides practical guidance to make better use of LLMs' potential in complex problem-solving scenarios. Second, we also investigated the relationship between the performance of CoT and the rationales used in demonstrations. Surprisingly, the result shows that even incorrect rationales can yield favorable outcomes if they maintain the requisite length of inference. Third, we observed that the advantages of increasing reasoning steps are task-dependent: simpler tasks require fewer steps, whereas complex tasks gain significantly from longer inference sequences.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recently, various Large Language Models (LLMs) evaluation datasets have emerged, but most of them have issues with distorted rankings and difficulty in model capabilities analysis. Addressing these concerns, this paper introduces ANGO, a Chinese multi-choice question evaluation benchmark. ANGO proposes \textit{Keypoint} categorization standard for the first time, each question in ANGO can correspond to multiple keypoints, effectively enhancing interpretability of evaluation results. Base on performance of real humans, we build a quantifiable question difficulty standard and divide ANGO questions into 9 difficulty levels, which provide more precise guidance for model training. To minimize data leakage impact and fully leverage ANGO's innovative features, we have engineered exclusive sampling strategies and a new evaluation framework that support swift testset iteration. Our experiments demonstrate that ANGO poses a stronger challenge to models and reveals more details in evaluation result compared to existing benchmarks.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have provided a new avenue for chatbot development, while most existing research has primarily centered on single-user chatbots that focus on deciding "What" to answer after user inputs. In this paper, we identified that multi-user chatbots have more complex 3W design dimensions -- "What" to say, "When" to respond, and "Who" to answer. Additionally, we proposed Multi-User Chat Assistant (MUCA), which is an LLM-based framework for chatbots specifically designed for group discussions. MUCA consists of three main modules: Sub-topic Generator, Dialog Analyzer, and Utterance Strategies Arbitrator. These modules jointly determine suitable response contents, timings, and the appropriate recipients. To make the optimizing process for MUCA easier, we further propose an LLM-based Multi-User Simulator (MUS) that can mimic real user behavior. This enables faster simulation of a conversation between the chatbot and simulated users, making the early development of the chatbot framework much more efficient. MUCA demonstrates effectiveness, including appropriate chime-in timing, relevant content, and positive user engagement, in goal-oriented conversations with a small to medium number of participants, as evidenced by case studies and experimental results from user studies.

**ABSTRACT**  
As LLMs have become capable of processing more complex types of inputs, researchers have recently studied how to efficiently and affordably process possibly arbitrarily long sequences. One effective approach is to use a FIFO memory to store keys and values of an attention sublayer from past chunks to allow subsequent queries to attend. However, this approach requires a large memory and/or takes into the consideration the specific LM architecture. Moreover, due to the causal nature between the key-values in prior context and the queries at present, this approach cannot be extended to bidirectional attention such as in an encoder-decoder or PrefixLM decoder-only architecture. In this paper, we propose to use eviction policies, such as LRA and LFA, to reduce the memory size and adapt to various architectures, and we also propose the Attendre layer, a wait-to-attend mechanism by retrieving the key-value memory (K/V memory) with evicted queries in the query memory (Q memory). As a first step, we evaluate this method in the context length extension setup using the TriviaQA reading comprehension task, and show the effectiveness of the approach.

**ABSTRACT**  
Establishing evaluation schemes for spoken dialogue systems is important, but it can also be challenging. While subjective evaluations are commonly used in user experiments, objective evaluations are necessary for research comparison and reproducibility. To address this issue, we propose a framework for indirectly but objectively evaluating systems based on users' behaviours. In this paper, to this end, we investigate the relationship between user behaviours and subjective evaluation scores in social dialogue tasks: attentive listening, job interview, and first-meeting conversation. The results reveal that in dialogue tasks where user utterances are primary, such as attentive listening and job interview, indicators like the number of utterances and words play a significant role in evaluation. Observing disfluency also can indicate the effectiveness of formal tasks, such as job interview. On the other hand, in dialogue tasks with high interactivity, such as first-meeting conversation, behaviours related to turn-taking, like average switch pause length, become more important. These findings suggest that selecting appropriate user behaviours can provide valuable insights for objective evaluation in each social dialogue task.

**ABSTRACT**  
Modeling long histories plays a pivotal role in enhancing recommendation systems, allowing to capture user's evolving preferences, resulting in more precise and personalized recommendations. In this study we tackle the challenges of modeling long user histories for preference understanding in natural language. Specifically, we introduce a new User Embedding Module (UEM) that efficiently processes user history in free-form text by compressing and representing them as embeddings, to use them as soft prompts to a LM. Our experiments demonstrate the superior capability of this approach in handling significantly longer histories compared to conventional text based prompting methods, yielding substantial improvements in predictive performance. The main contribution of this research is to demonstrate the ability to bias language models with user signals represented as embeddings.

**ABSTRACT**  
Are LLMs cultural technologies like photocopiers or printing presses, which transmit information but cannot create new content? A challenge for this idea, which we call bibliotechnism, is that LLMs often do generate entirely novel text. We begin by defending bibliotechnism against this challenge, showing how novel text may be meaningful only in a derivative sense, so that the content of this generated text depends in an important sense on the content of original human text. We go on to present a different, novel challenge for bibliotechnism, stemming from examples in which LLMs generate "novel reference", using novel names to refer to novel entities. Such examples could be smoothly explained if LLMs were not cultural technologies but possessed a limited form of agency (beliefs, desires, and intentions). According to interpretationism in the philosophy of mind, a system has beliefs, desires and intentions if and only if its behavior is well-explained by the hypothesis that it has such states. In line with this view, we argue that cases of novel reference provide evidence that LLMs do in fact have beliefs, desires, and intentions, and thus have a limited form of agency.

**ABSTRACT**  
Since the launch of applications such as DALL-E, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion, generative artificial intelligence has been controversial as a tool for creating artwork. While some have presented longtermist worries about these technologies as harbingers of fully automated futures to come, more pressing is the impact of generative AI on creative labour in the present. Already, business leaders have begun replacing human artistic labour with AI-generated images. In response, the artistic community has launched a protest movement, which argues that AI image generation is a kind of theft. This paper analyzes, substantiates, and critiques these arguments, concluding that AI image generators involve an unethical kind of labour theft. If correct, many other AI applications also rely upon theft.

**ABSTRACT**  
Although affective expressions of individuals have been extensively studied using social media, research has primarily focused on the Western context. There are substantial differences among cultures that contribute to their affective expressions. This paper examines the differences between Twitter (X) in the United States and Sina Weibo posts in China on two primary dimensions of affect - valence and arousal. We study the difference in the functional relationship between arousal and valence (so-called V-shaped) among individuals in the US and China and explore the associated content differences. Furthermore, we correlate word usage and topics in both platforms to interpret their differences. We observe that for Twitter users, the variation in emotional intensity is less distinct between negative and positive emotions compared to Weibo users, and there is a sharper escalation in arousal corresponding with heightened emotions. From language features, we discover that affective expressions are associated with personal life and feelings on Twitter, while on Weibo such discussions are about socio-political topics in the society. These results suggest a West-East difference in the V-shaped relationship between valence and arousal of affective expressions on social media influenced by content differences. Our findings have implications for applications and theories related to cultural differences in affective expressions.

**ABSTRACT**  
Decades after their inception, random forests continue to provide state-of-the-art accuracy in a variety of learning problems, outperforming in this respect alternative machine learning algorithms such as decision trees or even neural networks. However, being an ensemble method, the one aspect where random forests tend to severely underperform decision trees is interpretability. In the present work, we propose a post-hoc approach that aims to have the best of both worlds: the accuracy of random forests and the interpretability of decision trees. To this end, we present two forest-pruning methods to find an optimal sub-forest within a given random forest, and then, when applicable, combine the selected trees into one. Our first method relies on constrained exhaustive search, while our second method is based on an adaptation of the LASSO methodology. Extensive experiments over synthetic and real world datasets show that, in the majority of scenarios, at least one of the two methods proposed is more accurate than the original random forest, while just using a small fraction of the trees, aiding result interpretability. Compared to current state-of-the-art forestpruning methods, namely sequential forward selection and (a variation of) sequential backward selection, our methods tend to outperform both of them, whether in terms of accuracy, number of trees employed, or both.

**ABSTRACT**  
Ensemble methods exploit the availability of a given number of classifiers or detectors trained in single or multiple source domains and tasks to address machine learning problems such as domain adaptation or multi-source transfer learning. Existing research measures the domain distance between the sources and the target dataset, trains multiple networks on the same data with different samples per class, or combines predictions from models trained under varied hyperparameters and settings. Their solutions enhanced the performance on small or tail categories but hurt the rest. To this end, we propose a modified consensus focus for semi-supervised and long-tailed object detection. We introduce a voting system based on source confidence that spots the contribution of each model in a consensus, lets the user choose the relevance of each class in the target label space so that it relaxes minority bounding boxes suppression, and combines multiple models' results without discarding the poisonous networks. Our tests on synthetic driving datasets retrieved higher confidence and more accurate bounding boxes than the NMS, soft-NMS, and WBF.

**ABSTRACT**  
Generative AI has become pervasive in society, witnessing significant advancements in various domains. Particularly in the realm of Text-to-Image (TTI) models, Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), showcase remarkable capabilities in generating visual content based on textual prompts. This paper addresses the potential of LDMs in representing local cultural concepts, historical figures, and endangered species. In this study, we use the cultural heritage of Rio Grande do Sul (RS), Brazil, as an illustrative case. Our objective is to contribute to the broader understanding of how generative models can help to capture and preserve the cultural and historical identity of regions. The paper outlines the methodology, including subject selection, dataset creation, and the fine-tuning process. The results showcase the images generated, alongside the challenges and feasibility of each concept. In conclusion, this work shows the power of these models to represent and preserve unique aspects of diverse regions and communities.

**ABSTRACT**  
We present FPRF, a feed-forward photorealistic style transfer method for large-scale 3D neural radiance fields. FPRF stylizes large-scale 3D scenes with arbitrary, multiple style reference images without additional optimization while preserving multi-view appearance consistency. Prior arts required tedious per-style/-scene optimization and were limited to small-scale 3D scenes. FPRF efficiently stylizes large-scale 3D scenes by introducing a style-decomposed 3D neural radiance field, which inherits AdaIN's feed-forward stylization machinery, supporting arbitrary style reference images. Furthermore, FPRF supports multi-reference stylization with the semantic correspondence matching and local AdaIN, which adds diverse user control for 3D scene styles. FPRF also preserves multi-view consistency by applying semantic matching and style transfer processes directly onto queried features in 3D space. In experiments, we demonstrate that FPRF achieves favorable photorealistic quality 3D scene stylization for large-scale scenes with diverse reference images.

**ABSTRACT**  
This technical report introduces PIXART-{\delta}, a text-to-image synthesis framework that integrates the Latent Consistency Model (LCM) and ControlNet into the advanced PIXART-{\alpha} model. PIXART-{\alpha} is recognized for its ability to generate high-quality images of 1024px resolution through a remarkably efficient training process. The integration of LCM in PIXART-{\delta} significantly accelerates the inference speed, enabling the production of high-quality images in just 2-4 steps. Notably, PIXART-{\delta} achieves a breakthrough 0.5 seconds for generating 1024x1024 pixel images, marking a 7x improvement over the PIXART-{\alpha}. Additionally, PIXART-{\delta} is designed to be efficiently trainable on 32GB V100 GPUs within a single day. With its 8-bit inference capability (von Platen et al., 2023), PIXART-{\delta} can synthesize 1024px images within 8GB GPU memory constraints, greatly enhancing its usability and accessibility. Furthermore, incorporating a ControlNet-like module enables fine-grained control over text-to-image diffusion models. We introduce a novel ControlNet-Transformer architecture, specifically tailored for Transformers, achieving explicit controllability alongside high-quality image generation. As a state-of-the-art, open-source image generation model, PIXART-{\delta} offers a promising alternative to the Stable Diffusion family of models, contributing significantly to text-to-image synthesis.

**ABSTRACT**  
No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA) aims to predict image quality scores consistent with human perception without relying on pristine reference images, serving as a crucial component in various visual tasks. Ensuring the robustness of NR-IQA methods is vital for reliable comparisons of different image processing techniques and consistent user experiences in recommendations. The attack methods for NR-IQA provide a powerful instrument to test the robustness of NR-IQA. However, current attack methods of NR-IQA heavily rely on the gradient of the NR-IQA model, leading to limitations when the gradient information is unavailable. In this paper, we present a pioneering query-based black box attack against NR-IQA methods. We propose the concept of \emph{score boundary} and leverage an adaptive iterative approach with multiple score boundaries. Meanwhile, the initial attack directions are also designed to leverage the characteristics of the Human Visual System (HVS). Experiments show our attack method outperforms all compared state-of-the-art methods and is far ahead of previous black-box methods. The effective DBCNN model suffers a Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient (SROCC) decline of $0.6972$ attacked by our method, revealing the vulnerability of NR-IQA to black-box attacks. The proposed attack method also provides a potent tool for further exploration into NR-IQA robustness.

**ABSTRACT**  
Domain adaptation is crucial in aerial imagery, as the visual representation of these images can significantly vary based on factors such as geographic location, time, and weather conditions. Additionally, high-resolution aerial images often require substantial storage space and may not be readily accessible to the public. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Source-Free Object Detection (SFOD) method. Specifically, our approach is built upon a self-training framework; however, self-training can lead to inaccurate learning in the absence of labeled training data. To address this issue, we further integrate Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) to guide the generation of pseudo-labels, termed CLIP-guided Aggregation. By leveraging CLIP's zero-shot classification capability, we use it to aggregate scores with the original predicted bounding boxes, enabling us to obtain refined scores for the pseudo-labels. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we constructed two new datasets from different domains based on the DIOR dataset, named DIOR-C and DIOR-Cloudy. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms other comparative algorithms.

**ABSTRACT**  
Medical visual question answering (VQA) is a challenging multimodal task, where Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) models can effectively improve the generalization performance. However, most methods in the medical field treat VQA as an answer classification task which is difficult to transfer to practical application scenarios. Additionally, due to the privacy of medical images and the expensive annotation process, large-scale medical image-text pairs datasets for pretraining are severely lacking. In this paper, we propose a large-scale MultI-task Self-Supervised learning based framework (MISS) for medical VQA tasks. Unlike existing methods, we treat medical VQA as a generative task. We unify the text encoder and multimodal encoder and align image-text features through multi-task learning. Furthermore, we propose a Transfer-and-Caption method that extends the feature space of single-modal image datasets using large language models (LLMs), enabling those traditional medical vision field task data to be applied to VLP. Experiments show that our method achieves excellent results with fewer multimodal datasets and demonstrates the advantages of generative VQA models. The code and model weights will be released upon the paper's acceptance.

**ABSTRACT**  
Fusion of a panchromatic (PAN) image and corresponding multispectral (MS) image is also known as pansharpening, which aims to combine abundant spatial details of PAN and spectral information of MS. Due to the absence of high-resolution MS images, available deep-learning-based methods usually follow the paradigm of training at reduced resolution and testing at both reduced and full resolution. When taking original MS and PAN images as inputs, they always obtain sub-optimal results due to the scale variation. In this paper, we propose to explore the self-supervised representation of pansharpening by designing a cross-predictive diffusion model, named CrossDiff. It has two-stage training. In the first stage, we introduce a cross-predictive pretext task to pre-train the UNet structure based on conditional DDPM, while in the second stage, the encoders of the UNets are frozen to directly extract spatial and spectral features from PAN and MS, and only the fusion head is trained to adapt for pansharpening task. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed model compared with state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised methods. Besides, the cross-sensor experiments also verify the generalization ability of proposed self-supervised representation learners for other satellite's datasets. We will release our code for reproducibility.

**ABSTRACT**  
We propose a novel method for privacy-preserving deep neural networks (DNNs) with the Vision Transformer (ViT). The method allows us not only to train models and test with visually protected images but to also avoid the performance degradation caused from the use of encrypted images, whereas conventional methods cannot avoid the influence of image encryption. A domain adaptation method is used to efficiently fine-tune ViT with encrypted images. In experiments, the method is demonstrated to outperform conventional methods in an image classification task on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets in terms of classification accuracy.

**ABSTRACT**  
With recent advancements in aerospace technology, the volume of unlabeled remote sensing image (RSI) data has increased dramatically. Effectively leveraging this data through self-supervised learning (SSL) is vital in the field of remote sensing. However, current methodologies, particularly contrastive learning (CL), a leading SSL method, encounter specific challenges in this domain. Firstly, CL often mistakenly identifies geographically adjacent samples with similar semantic content as negative pairs, leading to confusion during model training. Secondly, as an instance-level discriminative task, it tends to neglect the essential fine-grained features and complex details inherent in unstructured RSIs. To overcome these obstacles, we introduce SwiMDiff, a novel self-supervised pre-training framework designed for RSIs. SwiMDiff employs a scene-wide matching approach that effectively recalibrates labels to recognize data from the same scene as false negatives. This adjustment makes CL more applicable to the nuances of remote sensing. Additionally, SwiMDiff seamlessly integrates CL with a diffusion model. Through the implementation of pixel-level diffusion constraints, we enhance the encoder's ability to capture both the global semantic information and the fine-grained features of the images more comprehensively. Our proposed framework significantly enriches the information available for downstream tasks in remote sensing. Demonstrating exceptional performance in change detection and land-cover classification tasks, SwiMDiff proves its substantial utility and value in the field of remote sensing.

**ABSTRACT**  
Motion deblurring is one of the fundamental problems of computer vision and has received continuous attention. The variability in blur, both within and across images, imposes limitations on non-blind deblurring techniques that rely on estimating the blur kernel. As a response, blind motion deblurring has emerged, aiming to restore clear and detailed images without prior knowledge of the blur type, fueled by the advancements in deep learning methodologies. Despite strides in this field, a comprehensive synthesis of recent progress in deep learning-based blind motion deblurring is notably absent. This paper fills that gap by providing an exhaustive overview of the role of deep learning in blind motion deblurring, encompassing datasets, evaluation metrics, and methods developed over the last six years. Specifically, we first introduce the types of motion blur and the fundamental principles of deblurring. Next, we outline the shortcomings of traditional non-blind deblurring algorithms, emphasizing the advantages of employing deep learning techniques for deblurring tasks. Following this, we categorize and summarize existing blind motion deblurring methods based on different backbone networks, including convolutional neural networks, generative adversarial networks, recurrent neural networks, and Transformer networks. Subsequently, we elaborate not only on the fundamental principles of these different categories but also provide a comprehensive summary and comparison of their advantages and limitations. Qualitative and quantitative experimental results conducted on four widely used datasets further compare the performance of SOTA methods. Finally, an analysis of present challenges and future pathways.

**ABSTRACT**  
To achieve seamless collaboration between robots and humans in a shared environment, accurately predicting future human movements is essential. Human motion prediction has traditionally been approached as a sequence prediction problem, leveraging historical human motion data to estimate future poses. Beginning with vanilla recurrent networks, the research community has investigated a variety of methods for learning human motion dynamics, encompassing graph-based and generative approaches. Despite these efforts, achieving accurate long-term predictions continues to be a significant challenge. In this regard, we present the Adversarial Motion Transformer (AdvMT), a novel model that integrates a transformer-based motion encoder and a temporal continuity discriminator. This combination effectively captures spatial and temporal dependencies simultaneously within frames. With adversarial training, our method effectively reduces the unwanted artifacts in predictions, thereby ensuring the learning of more realistic and fluid human motions. The evaluation results indicate that AdvMT greatly enhances the accuracy of long-term predictions while also delivering robust short-term predictions

**ABSTRACT**  
Semi-supervised 3D object detection is a promising yet under-explored direction to reduce data annotation costs, especially for cluttered indoor scenes. A few prior works, such as SESS and 3DIoUMatch, attempt to solve this task by utilizing a teacher model to generate pseudo-labels for unlabeled samples. However, the availability of unlabeled samples in the 3D domain is relatively limited compared to its 2D counterpart due to the greater effort required to collect 3D data. Moreover, the loose consistency regularization in SESS and restricted pseudo-label selection strategy in 3DIoUMatch lead to either low-quality supervision or a limited amount of pseudo labels. To address these issues, we present a novel Dual-Perspective Knowledge Enrichment approach named DPKE for semi-supervised 3D object detection. Our DPKE enriches the knowledge of limited training data, particularly unlabeled data, from two perspectives: data-perspective and feature-perspective. Specifically, from the data-perspective, we propose a class-probabilistic data augmentation method that augments the input data with additional instances based on the varying distribution of class probabilities. Our DPKE achieves feature-perspective knowledge enrichment by designing a geometry-aware feature matching method that regularizes feature-level similarity between object proposals from the student and teacher models. Extensive experiments on the two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our DPKE achieves superior performance over existing state-of-the-art approaches under various label ratio conditions. The source code will be made available to the public.

**ABSTRACT**  
Few-shot Learning aims to learn and distinguish new categories with a very limited number of available images, presenting a significant challenge in the realm of deep learning. Recent researchers have sought to leverage the additional textual or linguistic information of these rare categories with a pre-trained language model to facilitate learning, thus partially alleviating the problem of insufficient supervision signals. However, the full potential of the textual information and pre-trained language model have been underestimated in the few-shot learning till now, resulting in limited performance enhancements. To address this, we propose a simple but effective framework for few-shot learning tasks, specifically designed to exploit the textual information and language model. In more detail, we explicitly exploit the zero-shot capability of the pre-trained language model with the learnable prompt. And we just add the visual feature with the textual feature for inference directly without the intricate designed fusion modules in previous works. Additionally, we apply the self-ensemble and distillation to further enhance these components. Our extensive experiments conducted across four widely used few-shot datasets demonstrate that our simple framework achieves impressive results. Particularly noteworthy is its outstanding performance in the 1-shot learning task, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by an average of 3.0\% in classification accuracy. \footnote{We will make the source codes of the proposed framework publicly available upon acceptance. }.

**ABSTRACT**  
Event-based vision is an emerging research field involving processing data generated by Dynamic Vision Sensors (neuromorphic cameras). One of the latest proposals in this area are Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), which allow to process events in its original sparse form while maintaining high detection and classification performance. In this paper, we present the hardware implementation of a~graph generation process from an event camera data stream, taking into account both the advantages and limitations of FPGAs. We propose various ways to simplify the graph representation and use scaling and quantisation of values. We consider both undirected and directed graphs that enable the use of PointNet convolution. The results obtained show that by appropriately modifying the graph representation, it is possible to create a~hardware module for graph generation. Moreover, the proposed modifications have no significant impact on object detection performance, only 0.08% mAP less for the base model and the N-Caltech data set.Finally, we describe the proposed hardware architecture of the graph generation module.

**ABSTRACT**  
Learning correspondences aims to find correct correspondences (inliers) from the initial correspondence set with an uneven correspondence distribution and a low inlier rate, which can be regarded as graph data. Recent advances usually use graph neural networks (GNNs) to build a single type of graph or simply stack local graphs into the global one to complete the task. But they ignore the complementary relationship between different types of graphs, which can effectively capture potential relationships among sparse correspondences. To address this problem, we propose MGNet to effectively combine multiple complementary graphs. To obtain information integrating implicit and explicit local graphs, we construct local graphs from implicit and explicit aspects and combine them effectively, which is used to build a global graph. Moreover, we propose Graph~Soft~Degree~Attention (GSDA) to make full use of all sparse correspondence information at once in the global graph, which can capture and amplify discriminative features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in different visual tasks. The code is provided in https://github.com/DAILUANYUAN/MGNet-2024AAAI.

**ABSTRACT**  
Action recognition in videos poses a challenge due to its high computational cost, especially for Joint Space-Time video transformers (Joint VT). Despite their effectiveness, the excessive number of tokens in such architectures significantly limits their efficiency. In this paper, we propose HaltingVT, an efficient video transformer adaptively removing redundant video patch tokens, which is primarily composed of a Joint VT and a Glimpser module. Specifically, HaltingVT applies data-adaptive token reduction at each layer, resulting in a significant reduction in the overall computational cost. Besides, the Glimpser module quickly removes redundant tokens in shallow transformer layers, which may even be misleading for video recognition tasks based on our observations. To further encourage HaltingVT to focus on the key motion-related information in videos, we design an effective Motion Loss during training. HaltingVT acquires video analysis capabilities and token halting compression strategies simultaneously in a unified training process, without requiring additional training procedures or sub-networks. On the Mini-Kinetics dataset, we achieved 75.0% top-1 ACC with 24.2 GFLOPs, as well as 67.2% top-1 ACC with an extremely low 9.9 GFLOPs. The code is available at https://github.com/dun-research/HaltingVT.

**ABSTRACT**  
Keyframe extraction aims to sum up a video's semantics with the minimum number of its frames. This paper puts forward a Large Model based Sequential Keyframe Extraction for video summarization, dubbed LMSKE, which contains three stages as below. First, we use the large model "TransNetV21" to cut the video into consecutive shots, and employ the large model "CLIP2" to generate each frame's visual feature within each shot; Second, we develop an adaptive clustering algorithm to yield candidate keyframes for each shot, with each candidate keyframe locating nearest to a cluster center; Third, we further reduce the above candidate keyframes via redundancy elimination within each shot, and finally concatenate them in accordance with the sequence of shots as the final sequential keyframes. To evaluate LMSKE, we curate a benchmark dataset and conduct rich experiments, whose results exhibit that LMSKE performs much better than quite a few SOTA competitors with average F1 of 0.5311, average fidelity of 0.8141, and average compression ratio of 0.9922.

**ABSTRACT**  
Accurate polyp detection is critical for early colorectal cancer diagnosis. Although remarkable progress has been achieved in recent years, the complex colon environment and concealed polyps with unclear boundaries still pose severe challenges in this area. Existing methods either involve computationally expensive context aggregation or lack prior modeling of polyps, resulting in poor performance in challenging cases. In this paper, we propose the Enhanced CenterNet with Contrastive Learning (ECC-PolypDet), a two-stage training \& end-to-end inference framework that leverages images and bounding box annotations to train a general model and fine-tune it based on the inference score to obtain a final robust model. Specifically, we conduct Box-assisted Contrastive Learning (BCL) during training to minimize the intra-class difference and maximize the inter-class difference between foreground polyps and backgrounds, enabling our model to capture concealed polyps. Moreover, to enhance the recognition of small polyps, we design the Semantic Flow-guided Feature Pyramid Network (SFFPN) to aggregate multi-scale features and the Heatmap Propagation (HP) module to boost the model's attention on polyp targets. In the fine-tuning stage, we introduce the IoU-guided Sample Re-weighting (ISR) mechanism to prioritize hard samples by adaptively adjusting the loss weight for each sample during fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on six large-scale colonoscopy datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model compared with previous state-of-the-art detectors.

**ABSTRACT**  
Eye movement (EM) is a new highly secure biometric behavioral modality that has received increasing attention in recent years. Although deep neural networks, such as convolutional neural network (CNN), have recently achieved promising performance, current solutions fail to capture local and global temporal dependencies within eye movement data. To overcome this problem, we propose in this paper a mixed transformer termed EmMixformer to extract time and frequency domain information for eye movement recognition. To this end, we propose a mixed block consisting of three modules, transformer, attention Long short-term memory (attention LSTM), and Fourier transformer. We are the first to attempt leveraging transformer to learn long temporal dependencies within eye movement. Second, we incorporate the attention mechanism into LSTM to propose attention LSTM with the aim to learn short temporal dependencies. Third, we perform self attention in the frequency domain to learn global features. As the three modules provide complementary feature representations in terms of local and global dependencies, the proposed EmMixformer is capable of improving recognition accuracy. The experimental results on our eye movement dataset and two public eye movement datasets show that the proposed EmMixformer outperforms the state of the art by achieving the lowest verification error.

**ABSTRACT**  
Previous probabilistic models for 3D Human Pose Estimation (3DHPE) aimed to enhance pose accuracy by generating multiple hypotheses. However, most of the hypotheses generated deviate substantially from the true pose. Compared to deterministic models, the excessive uncertainty in probabilistic models leads to weaker performance in single-hypothesis prediction. To address these two challenges, we propose a diffusion-based refinement framework called DRPose, which refines the output of deterministic models by reverse diffusion and achieves more suitable multi-hypothesis prediction for the current pose benchmark by multi-step refinement with multiple noises. To this end, we propose a Scalable Graph Convolution Transformer (SGCT) and a Pose Refinement Module (PRM) for denoising and refining. Extensive experiments on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both single and multi-hypothesis 3DHPE. Code is available at https://github.com/KHB1698/DRPose.

**ABSTRACT**  
Predicting pedestrian motion trajectories is crucial for path planning and motion control of autonomous vehicles. Accurately forecasting crowd trajectories is challenging due to the uncertain nature of human motions in different environments. For training, recent deep learning-based prediction approaches mainly utilize information like trajectory history and interactions between pedestrians, among others. This can limit the prediction performance across various scenarios since the discrepancies between training datasets have not been properly incorporated. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes a graph transformer structure to improve prediction performance, capturing the differences between the various sites and scenarios contained in the datasets. In particular, a self-attention mechanism and a domain adaption module have been designed to improve the generalization ability of the model. Moreover, an additional metric considering cross-dataset sequences is introduced for training and performance evaluation purposes. The proposed framework is validated and compared against existing methods using popular public datasets, i.e., ETH and UCY. Experimental results demonstrate the improved performance of our proposed scheme.

**ABSTRACT**  
The goal of our work is to generate high-quality novel views from monocular videos of complex and dynamic scenes. Prior methods, such as DynamicNeRF, have shown impressive performance by leveraging time-varying dynamic radiation fields. However, these methods have limitations when it comes to accurately modeling the motion of complex objects, which can lead to inaccurate and blurry renderings of details. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach that builds upon a recent generalization NeRF, which aggregates nearby views onto new viewpoints. However, such methods are typically only effective for static scenes. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a module that operates in both the time and frequency domains to aggregate the features of object motion. This allows us to learn the relationship between frames and generate higher-quality images. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods on dynamic scene datasets. Specifically, our approach outperforms existing methods in terms of both the accuracy and visual quality of the synthesized views.

**ABSTRACT**  
Zero-shot learning offers an efficient solution for a machine learning model to treat unseen categories, avoiding exhaustive data collection. Zero-shot Sketch-based Image Retrieval (ZS-SBIR) simulates real-world scenarios where it is hard and costly to collect paired sketch-photo samples. We propose a novel framework that indirectly aligns sketches and photos by contrasting them through texts, removing the necessity of access to sketch-photo pairs. With an explicit modality encoding learned from data, our approach disentangles modality-agnostic semantics from modality-specific information, bridging the modality gap and enabling effective cross-modal content retrieval within a joint latent space. From comprehensive experiments, we verify the efficacy of the proposed model on ZS-SBIR, and it can be also applied to generalized and fine-grained settings.

**ABSTRACT**  
Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms have recently made significant strides in improving network performance. Nonetheless, their practical use is still limited in the absence of safe exploration and safe decision-making. In the context of commercial solutions, reliable and safe-to-operate systems are of paramount importance. Taking this problem into account, we propose a safe learning-based load balancing algorithm for Software Defined-Wide Area Network (SD-WAN), which is empowered by Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) combined with a Control Barrier Function (CBF). It safely projects unsafe actions into feasible ones during both training and testing, and it guides learning towards safe policies. We successfully implemented the solution on GPU to accelerate training by approximately 110x times and achieve model updates for on-policy methods within a few seconds, making the solution practical. We show that our approach delivers near-optimal Quality-of-Service (QoS performance in terms of end-to-end delay while respecting safety requirements related to link capacity constraints. We also demonstrated that on-policy learning based on Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) performs better than off-policy learning with Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) when both are combined with a CBF for safe load balancing.

**ABSTRACT**  
The Open Radio Access Network (Open RAN) paradigm, and its reference architecture proposed by the O-RAN Alliance, is paving the way toward open, interoperable, observable and truly intelligent cellular networks. Crucial to this evolution is Machine Learning (ML), which will play a pivotal role by providing the necessary tools to realize the vision of self-organizing O-RAN systems. However, to be actionable, ML algorithms need to demonstrate high reliability, effectiveness in delivering high performance, and the ability to adapt to varying network conditions, traffic demands and performance requirements. To address these challenges, in this paper we propose a novel Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent design for O-RAN applications that can learn control policies under varying Service Level Agreement (SLAs) with heterogeneous minimum performance requirements. We focus on the case of RAN slicing and SLAs specifying maximum tolerable end-to-end latency levels. We use the OpenRAN Gym open-source environment to train a DRL agent that can adapt to varying SLAs and compare it against the state-of-the-art. We show that our agent maintains a low SLA violation rate that is 8.3x and 14.4x lower than approaches based on Deep Q- Learning (DQN) and Q-Learning while consuming respectively 0.3x and 0.6x fewer resources without the need for re-training.

**ABSTRACT**  
As digitalization increases, countries employ digital diplomacy, harnessing digital resources to project their desired image. Digital diplomacy also encompasses the interactivity of digital platforms, providing a trove of public opinion that diplomatic agents can collect. Social media bots actively participate in political events through influencing political communication and purporting coordinated narratives to influence human behavior. This article provides a methodology towards identifying three types of bots: General Bots, News Bots and Bridging Bots, then further identify these classes of bots on Twitter during a diplomatic incident involving the United States and China. Using a series of computational methods, this article examines the impact of bots on the topics disseminated, the influence and the use of information maneuvers of bots within the social communication network. Among others, our results observe that all three types of bots are present across the two countries; bots geotagged to the US are generally concerned with the balloon location while those geotagged to China discussed topics related to escalating tensions; and perform different extent of positive narrative and network information maneuvers.

**ABSTRACT**  
Graph neural networks (GNN) are a powerful tool for combining imaging and non-imaging medical information for node classification tasks. Cross-network node classification extends GNN techniques to account for domain drift, allowing for node classification on an unlabeled target network. In this paper we present OTGCN, a powerful, novel approach to cross-network node classification. This approach leans on concepts from graph convolutional networks to harness insights from graph data structures while simultaneously applying strategies rooted in optimal transport to correct for the domain drift that can occur between samples from different data collection sites. This blended approach provides a practical solution for scenarios with many distinct forms of data collected across different locations and equipment. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach at classifying Autism Spectrum Disorder subjects using a blend of imaging and non-imaging data.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper introduces a new problem in the field of graph mining and social network analysis called new node prediction. More technically, the task can be categorized as zero-shot out-of-graph all-links prediction. This challenging problem aims to predict all links from a new, isolated, and unobserved node that was previously disconnected from the graph. Unlike classic approaches to link prediction (including few-shot out-of-graph link prediction), this problem presents two key differences: (1) the new node has no existing links from which to extract patterns for new predictions; and (2) the goal is to predict not just one, but all the links of this new node, or at least a significant part of them. Experiments demonstrate that an architecture based on Deep Graph Neural Networks can learn to solve this challenging problem in a bibliographic citation network.

**ABSTRACT**  
The segmentation of medical images is important for the improvement and creation of healthcare systems, particularly for early disease detection and treatment planning. In recent years, the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and other state-of-the-art methods has greatly advanced medical image segmentation. However, CNNs have been found to struggle with learning long-range dependencies and capturing global context due to the limitations of convolution operations. In this paper, we explore the use of transformers and CNNs for medical image segmentation and propose a hybrid architecture that combines the ability of transformers to capture global dependencies with the ability of CNNs to capture low-level spatial details. We compare various architectures and configurations and conduct multiple experiments to evaluate their effectiveness.

**ABSTRACT**  
Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), an ocular complication of diabetes, is a leading cause of blindness worldwide. Traditionally, DR is monitored using Color Fundus Photography (CFP), a widespread 2-D imaging modality. However, DR classifications based on CFP have poor predictive power, resulting in suboptimal DR management. Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) is a recent 3-D imaging modality offering enhanced structural and functional information (blood flow) with a wider field of view. This paper investigates automatic DR severity assessment using 3-D OCTA. A straightforward solution to this task is a 3-D neural network classifier. However, 3-D architectures have numerous parameters and typically require many training samples. A lighter solution consists in using 2-D neural network classifiers processing 2-D en-face (or frontal) projections and/or 2-D cross-sectional slices. Such an approach mimics the way ophthalmologists analyze OCTA acquisitions: 1) en-face flow maps are often used to detect avascular zones and neovascularization, and 2) cross-sectional slices are commonly analyzed to detect macular edemas, for instance. However, arbitrary data reduction or selection might result in information loss. Two complementary strategies are thus proposed to optimally summarize OCTA volumes with 2-D images: 1) a parametric en-face projection optimized through deep learning and 2) a cross-sectional slice selection process controlled through gradient-based attribution. The full summarization and DR classification pipeline is trained from end to end. The automatic 2-D summary can be displayed in a viewer or printed in a report to support the decision. We show that the proposed 2-D summarization and classification pipeline outperforms direct 3-D classification with the advantage of improved interpretability.

**ABSTRACT**  
Large Language Models have shown exceptional generative abilities in various natural language and generation tasks. However, possible anthropomorphization and leniency towards failure cases have propelled discussions on emergent abilities of Large Language Models especially on Theory of Mind (ToM) abilities in Large Language Models. While several false-belief tests exists to verify the ability to infer and maintain mental models of another entity, we study a special application of ToM abilities that has higher stakes and possibly irreversible consequences : Human Robot Interaction. In this work, we explore the task of Perceived Behavior Recognition, where a robot employs a Large Language Model (LLM) to assess the robot's generated behavior in a manner similar to human observer. We focus on four behavior types, namely - explicable, legible, predictable, and obfuscatory behavior which have been extensively used to synthesize interpretable robot behaviors. The LLMs goal is, therefore to be a human proxy to the agent, and to answer how a certain agent behavior would be perceived by the human in the loop, for example "Given a robot's behavior X, would the human observer find it explicable?". We conduct a human subject study to verify that the users are able to correctly answer such a question in the curated situations (robot setting and plan) across five domains. A first analysis of the belief test yields extremely positive results inflating ones expectations of LLMs possessing ToM abilities. We then propose and perform a suite of perturbation tests which breaks this illusion, i.e. Inconsistent Belief, Uninformative Context and Conviction Test. We conclude that, the high score of LLMs on vanilla prompts showcases its potential use in HRI settings, however to possess ToM demands invariance to trivial or irrelevant perturbations in the context which LLMs lack.

**ABSTRACT**  
We present CineMPC, a complete cinematographic system that autonomously controls a drone to film multiple targets recording user-specified aesthetic objectives. Existing solutions in autonomous cinematography control only the camera extrinsics, namely its position, and orientation. In contrast, CineMPC is the first solution that includes the camera intrinsic parameters in the control loop, which are essential tools for controlling cinematographic effects like focus, depth-of-field, and zoom. The system estimates the relative poses between the targets and the camera from an RGB-D image and optimizes a trajectory for the extrinsic and intrinsic camera parameters to film the artistic and technical requirements specified by the user. The drone and the camera are controlled in a nonlinear Model Predicted Control (MPC) loop by re-optimizing the trajectory at each time step in response to current conditions in the scene. The perception system of CineMPC can track the targets' position and orientation despite the camera effects. Experiments in a photorealistic simulation and with a real platform demonstrate the capabilities of the system to achieve a full array of cinematographic effects that are not possible without the control of the intrinsics of the camera. Code for CineMPC is implemented following a modular architecture in ROS and released to the community.

**ABSTRACT**  
Mobile robotic systems are becoming increasingly popular. These systems are used in various indoor applications, raging from warehousing and manufacturing to test benches for assessment of advanced control strategies, such as artificial intelligence (AI)-based control solutions, just to name a few. Scaled robotic cars are commonly equipped with a hierarchical control acthiecture that includes tasks dedicated to vehicle state estimation and control. This paper covers both aspects by proposing (i) a federeted extended Kalman filter (FEKF), and (ii) a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) path tracking controller trained via an expert demonstrator to expedite the learning phase and increase robustess to the simulation-to-reality gap. The paper also presents the formulation of a vehicle model along with an effective yet simple procedure for identifying tis paramters. The experimentally validated model is used for (i) supporting the design of the FEKF and (ii) serving as a digital twin for training the proposed DRL-based path tracking algorithm. Experimental results confirm the ability of the FEKF to improve the estimate of the mobile robot's position. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the DRL path tracking strateguy is experimentally tested along manoeuvres not considered during training, showing also the ability of the AI-based solution to outpeform model-based control strategies and the demonstrator. The comparison with benchmraking controllers is quantitavely evalueted through a set of key performance indicators.

**ABSTRACT**  
Coverage control is the problem of navigating a robot swarm to collaboratively monitor features or a phenomenon of interest not known a priori. The problem is challenging in decentralized settings with robots that have limited communication and sensing capabilities. This paper proposes a learnable Perception-Action-Communication (LPAC) architecture for the coverage control problem. In the proposed solution, a convolution neural network (CNN) processes localized perception of the environment; a graph neural network (GNN) enables communication of relevant information between neighboring robots; finally, a shallow multi-layer perceptron (MLP) computes robot actions. The GNN in the communication module enables collaboration in the robot swarm by computing what information to communicate with neighbors and how to use received information to take appropriate actions. We train models using imitation learning with a centralized clairvoyant algorithm that is aware of the entire environment. Evaluations show that the LPAC models outperform standard decentralized and centralized coverage control algorithms. The learned policy generalizes to environments different from the training dataset, transfers to larger environments with an increased number of robots, and is robust to noisy position estimates. The results indicate that LPAC architectures are well-suited for decentralized navigation in robot swarms to achieve collaborative behavior.

**ABSTRACT**  
Managing knowledge efficiently is crucial for organizational success. In manufacturing, operating factories has become increasing knowledge-intensive putting strain on the factory's capacity to train and support new operators. In this paper, we introduce a Large Language Model (LLM)-based system designed to use the extensive knowledge contained in factory documentation. The system aims to efficiently answer queries from operators and facilitate the sharing of new knowledge. To assess its effectiveness, we conducted an evaluation in a factory setting. The results of this evaluation demonstrated the system's benefits; namely, in enabling quicker information retrieval and more efficient resolution of issues. However, the study also highlighted a preference for learning from a human expert when such an option is available. Furthermore, we benchmarked several closed and open-sourced LLMs for this system. GPT-4 consistently outperformed its counterparts, with open-source models like StableBeluga2 trailing closely, presenting an attractive option given its data privacy and customization benefits. Overall, this work offers preliminary insights for factories considering using LLM-tools for knowledge management.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper aims to develop a semi-formal design space for Human-AI interactions, by building a set of interaction primitives which specify the communication between users and AI systems during their interaction. We show how these primitives can be combined into a set of interaction patterns which can provide an abstract specification for exchanging messages between humans and AI/ML models to carry out purposeful interactions. The motivation behind this is twofold: firstly, to provide a compact generalisation of existing practices, that highlights the similarities and differences between systems in terms of their interaction behaviours; and secondly, to support the creation of new systems, in particular by opening the space of possibilities for interactions with models. We present a short literature review on frameworks, guidelines and taxonomies related to the design and implementation of HAI interactions, including human-in-the-loop, explainable AI, as well as hybrid intelligence and collaborative learning approaches. From the literature review, we define a vocabulary for describing information exchanges in terms of providing and requesting particular model-specific data types. Based on this vocabulary, a message passing model for interactions between humans and models is presented, which we demonstrate can account for existing systems and approaches. Finally, we build this into design patterns as mid-level constructs that capture common interactional structures. We discuss how this approach can be used towards a design space for Human-AI interactions that creates new possibilities for designs as well as keeping track of implementation issues and concerns.

**ABSTRACT**  
Despite neural networks (NN) have been widely applied in various fields and generally outperforms humans, they still lack interpretability to a certain extent, and humans are unable to intuitively understand the decision logic of NN. This also hinders the knowledge interaction between humans and NN, preventing humans from getting involved to give direct guidance when NN's decisions go wrong. While recent research in explainable AI has achieved interpretability of NN from various perspectives, it has not yet provided effective methods for knowledge exchange between humans and NN. To address this problem, we constructed a two-way interaction interface that uses structured representations of visual concepts and their relationships as the "language" for knowledge exchange between humans and NN. Specifically, NN provide intuitive reasoning explanations to humans based on the class-specific structural concepts graph (C-SCG). On the other hand, humans can modify the biases present in the C-SCG through their prior knowledge and reasoning ability, and thus provide direct knowledge guidance to NN through this interface. Through experimental validation, based on this interaction interface, NN can provide humans with easily understandable explanations of the reasoning process. Furthermore, human involvement and prior knowledge can directly and effectively contribute to enhancing the performance of NN.

**ABSTRACT**  
Since the advent of personal computing devices, intelligent personal assistants (IPAs) have been one of the key technologies that researchers and engineers have focused on, aiming to help users efficiently obtain information and execute tasks, and provide users with more intelligent, convenient, and rich interaction experiences. With the development of smartphones and IoT, computing and sensing devices have become ubiquitous, greatly expanding the boundaries of IPAs. However, due to the lack of capabilities such as user intent understanding, task planning, tool using, and personal data management etc., existing IPAs still have limited practicality and scalability. Recently, the emergence of foundation models, represented by large language models (LLMs), brings new opportunities for the development of IPAs. With the powerful semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities, LLM can enable intelligent agents to solve complex problems autonomously. In this paper, we focus on Personal LLM Agents, which are LLM-based agents that are deeply integrated with personal data and personal devices and used for personal assistance. We envision that Personal LLM Agents will become a major software paradigm for end-users in the upcoming era. To realize this vision, we take the first step to discuss several important questions about Personal LLM Agents, including their architecture, capability, efficiency and security. We start by summarizing the key components and design choices in the architecture of Personal LLM Agents, followed by an in-depth analysis of the opinions collected from domain experts. Next, we discuss several key challenges to achieve intelligent, efficient and secure Personal LLM Agents, followed by a comprehensive survey of representative solutions to address these challenges.

**ABSTRACT**  
The digital era has seen a marked increase in financial fraud. edge ML emerged as a promising solution for smartphone payment services fraud detection, enabling the deployment of ML models directly on edge devices. This approach enables a more personalized real-time fraud detection. However, a significant gap in current research is the lack of a robust system for monitoring data distribution shifts in these distributed edge ML applications. Our work bridges this gap by introducing a novel open-source framework designed for continuous monitoring of data distribution shifts on a network of edge devices. Our system includes an innovative calculation of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test over a distributed network of edge devices, enabling efficient and accurate monitoring of users behavior shifts. We comprehensively evaluate the proposed framework employing both real-world and synthetic financial transaction datasets and demonstrate the framework's effectiveness.

**ABSTRACT**  
The automation of code review has been tackled by several researchers with the goal of reducing its cost. The adoption of deep learning in software engineering pushed the automation to new boundaries, with techniques imitating developers in generative tasks, such as commenting on a code change as a reviewer would do or addressing a reviewer's comment by modifying code. The performance of these techniques is usually assessed through quantitative metrics, e.g., the percentage of instances in the test set for which correct predictions are generated, leaving many open questions on the techniques' capabilities. For example, knowing that an approach is able to correctly address a reviewer's comment in 10% of cases is of little value without knowing what was asked by the reviewer: What if in all successful cases the code change required to address the comment was just the removal of an empty line? In this paper we aim at characterizing the cases in which three code review automation techniques tend to succeed or fail in the two above-described tasks. The study has a strong qualitative focus, with ~105 man-hours of manual inspection invested in manually analyzing correct and wrong predictions generated by the three techniques, for a total of 2,291 inspected predictions. The output of this analysis are two taxonomies reporting, for each of the two tasks, the types of code changes on which the experimented techniques tend to succeed or to fail, pointing to areas for future work. A result of our manual analysis was also the identification of several issues in the datasets used to train and test the experimented techniques. Finally, we assess the importance of researching in techniques specialized for code review automation by comparing their performance with ChatGPT, a general purpose large language model, finding that ChatGPT struggles in commenting code as a human reviewer would do.

**ABSTRACT**  
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are essential time-series metrics for ensuring the reliability and stability of many software systems. They faithfully record runtime states to facilitate the understanding of anomalous system behaviors and provide informative clues for engineers to pinpoint the root causes. The unprecedented scale and complexity of modern software systems, however, make the volume of KPIs explode. Consequently, many traditional methods of KPI anomaly detection become impractical, which serves as a catalyst for the fast development of machine learning-based solutions in both academia and industry. However, there is currently a lack of rigorous comparison among these KPI anomaly detection methods, and re-implementation demands a non-trivial effort. Moreover, we observe that different works adopt independent evaluation processes with different metrics. Some of them may not fully reveal the capability of a model and some are creating an illusion of progress. To better understand the characteristics of different KPI anomaly detectors and address the evaluation issue, in this paper, we provide a comprehensive review and evaluation of twelve state-of-the-art methods, and propose a novel metric called salience. Particularly, the selected methods include five traditional machine learning-based methods and seven deep learning-based methods. These methods are evaluated with five multivariate KPI datasets that are publicly available. A unified toolkit with easy-to-use interfaces is also released. We report the benchmark results in terms of accuracy, salience, efficiency, and delay, which are of practical importance for industrial deployment. We believe our work can contribute as a basis for future academic research and industrial application.

**ABSTRACT**  
Ensuring the safety of autonomous vehicles (AVs) is the key requisite for their acceptance in society. This complexity is the core challenge in formally proving their safety conditions with AI-based black-box controllers and surrounding objects under various traffic scenarios. This paper describes our strategy and experience in modelling, deriving, and proving the safety conditions of AVs with the Event-B refinement mechanism to reduce complexity. Our case study targets the state-of-the-art model of goal-aware responsibility-sensitive safety to argue over interactions with surrounding vehicles. We also employ the Simplex architecture to involve advanced black-box AI controllers. Our experience has demonstrated that the refinement mechanism can be effectively used to gradually develop the complex system over scenario variations.

**ABSTRACT**  
Over the past few years, the use of the Internet for healthcare-related tasks has grown by leaps and bounds, posing a challenge in effectively managing and processing information to ensure its efficient utilization. During moments of emotional turmoil and psychological challenges, we frequently turn to the internet as our initial source of support, choosing this over discussing our feelings with others due to the associated social stigma. In this paper, we propose a new task of multi-modal medical concern summary (MMCS) generation, which provides a short and precise summary of patients' major concerns brought up during the consultation. Nonverbal cues, such as patients' gestures and facial expressions, aid in accurately identifying patients' concerns. Doctors also consider patients' personal information, such as age and gender, in order to describe the medical condition appropriately. Motivated by the potential efficacy of patients' personal context and visual gestures, we propose a transformer-based multi-task, multi-modal intent-recognition, and medical concern summary generation (IR-MMCSG) system. Furthermore, we propose a multitasking framework for intent recognition and medical concern summary generation for doctor-patient consultations. We construct the first multi-modal medical concern summary generation (MM-MediConSummation) corpus, which includes patient-doctor consultations annotated with medical concern summaries, intents, patient personal information, doctor's recommendations, and keywords. Our experiments and analysis demonstrate (a) the significant role of patients' expressions/gestures and their personal information in intent identification and medical concern summary generation, and (b) the strong correlation between intent recognition and patients' medical concern summary generation   The dataset and source code are available at https://github.com/NLP-RL/MMCSG.

**ABSTRACT**  
Significant strides have been made in creating voice identity representations using speech data. However, the same level of progress has not been achieved for singing voices. To bridge this gap, we suggest a framework for training singer identity encoders to extract representations suitable for various singing-related tasks, such as singing voice similarity and synthesis. We explore different self-supervised learning techniques on a large collection of isolated vocal tracks and apply data augmentations during training to ensure that the representations are invariant to pitch and content variations. We evaluate the quality of the resulting representations on singer similarity and identification tasks across multiple datasets, with a particular emphasis on out-of-domain generalization. Our proposed framework produces high-quality embeddings that outperform both speaker verification and wav2vec 2.0 pre-trained baselines on singing voice while operating at 44.1 kHz. We release our code and trained models to facilitate further research on singing voice and related areas.

**ABSTRACT**  
Transformer model empowered architectures have become a pillar of cloud services that keeps reshaping our society. However, the dynamic query loads and heterogeneous user requirements severely challenge current transformer serving systems, which rely on pre-training multiple variants of a foundation model, i.e., with different sizes, to accommodate varying service demands. Unfortunately, such a mechanism is unsuitable for large transformer models due to the additional training costs and excessive I/O delay. In this paper, we introduce OTAS, the first elastic serving system specially tailored for transformer models by exploring lightweight token management. We develop a novel idea called token adaptation that adds prompting tokens to improve accuracy and removes redundant tokens to accelerate inference. To cope with fluctuating query loads and diverse user requests, we enhance OTAS with application-aware selective batching and online token adaptation. OTAS first batches incoming queries with similar service-level objectives to improve the ingress throughput. Then, to strike a tradeoff between the overhead of token increment and the potentials for accuracy improvement, OTAS adaptively adjusts the token execution strategy by solving an optimization problem. We implement and evaluate a prototype of OTAS with multiple datasets, which show that OTAS improves the system utility by at least 18.2%.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recently, large language models such as ChatGPT have showcased remarkable abilities in solving general tasks, demonstrating the potential for applications in recommender systems. To assess how effectively LLMs can be used in recommendation tasks, our study primarily focuses on employing LLMs as recommender systems through prompting engineering. We propose a general framework for utilizing LLMs in recommendation tasks, focusing on the capabilities of LLMs as recommenders. To conduct our analysis, we formalize the input of LLMs for recommendation into natural language prompts with two key aspects, and explain how our framework can be generalized to various recommendation scenarios. As for the use of LLMs as recommenders, we analyze the impact of public availability, tuning strategies, model architecture, parameter scale, and context length on recommendation results based on the classification of LLMs. As for prompt engineering, we further analyze the impact of four important components of prompts, \ie task descriptions, user interest modeling, candidate items construction and prompting strategies. In each section, we first define and categorize concepts in line with the existing literature. Then, we propose inspiring research questions followed by experiments to systematically analyze the impact of different factors on two public datasets. Finally, we summarize promising directions to shed lights on future research.

**ABSTRACT**  
Tagging-based systems enable users to categorize web resources by means of tags (freely chosen keywords), in order to refinding these resources later. Tagging is implicitly also a social indexing process, since users share their tags and resources, constructing a social tag index, so-called folksonomy. At the same time of tagging-based system, has been popularised an interface model for visual information retrieval known as Tag-Cloud. In this model, the most frequently used tags are displayed in alphabetical order. This paper presents a novel approach to Tag-Cloud's tags selection, and proposes the use of clustering algorithms for visual layout, with the aim of improve browsing experience. The results suggest that presented approach reduces the semantic density of tag set, and improves the visual consistency of Tag-Cloud layout.

**ABSTRACT**  
The reliable diagnosis of cardiac conditions through electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis critically depends on accurately detecting P waves and measuring the PR interval. However, achieving consistent and generalizable diagnoses across diverse populations presents challenges due to the inherent global variations observed in ECG signals. This paper is focused on applying the Q learning reinforcement algorithm to the various ECG datasets available in the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge (CinC). Five ECG beats, including Normal Sinus Rhythm, Atrial Flutter, Atrial Fibrillation, 1st Degree Atrioventricular Block, and Left Atrial Enlargement, are included to study variations of P waves and PR Interval on Lead II and Lead V1. Q-Agent classified 71,672 beat samples in 8,867 patients with an average accuracy of 90.4% and only 9.6% average hamming loss over misclassification. The average classification time at the 100th episode containing around 40,000 samples is 0.04 seconds. An average training reward of 344.05 is achieved at an alpha, gamma, and SoftMax temperature rate of 0.001, 0.9, and 0.1, respectively.

**ABSTRACT**  
Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning is a powerful tool to solve many real-world cooperative tasks, but restrictions of real-world applications may require training the agents in a fully decentralized manner. Due to the lack of information about other agents, it is challenging to derive algorithms that can converge to the optimal joint policy in a fully decentralized setting. Thus, this research area has not been thoroughly studied. In this paper, we seek to systematically review the fully decentralized methods in two settings: maximizing a shared reward of all agents and maximizing the sum of individual rewards of all agents, and discuss open questions and future research directions.

**ABSTRACT**  
The age and mass of red giants are essential for understanding the structure and evolution of the Milky Way. Traditional isochrone methods for these estimations are inherently limited due to overlapping isochrones in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, while asteroseismology, though more precise, requires high-precision, long-term observations. In response to these challenges, we developed a novel framework, Spectral Transformer (SPT), to predict the age and mass of red giants aligned with asteroseismology from their spectra. A key component of SPT, the Multi-head Hadamard Self-Attention mechanism, designed specifically for spectra, can capture complex relationships across different wavelength. Further, we introduced a Mahalanobis distance-based loss function to address scale imbalance and interaction mode loss, and incorporated Monte Carlo dropout for quantitative analysis of prediction uncertainty.Trained and tested on 3,880 red giant spectra from LAMOST, the SPT achieved remarkable age and mass estimations with average percentage errors of 17.64% and 6.61%, respectively, and provided uncertainties for each corresponding prediction. The results significantly outperform those of traditional machine learning algorithms and demonstrate a high level of consistency with asteroseismology methods and isochrone fitting techniques. In the future, our work will leverage datasets from the Chinese Space Station Telescope and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope to enhance the precision of the model and broaden its applicability in the field of astronomy and astrophysics.

One in five arXiv articles published in 2021 contained a URI to a Git Hosting Platform (GHP), which demonstrates the growing prevalence of GHP URIs in scholarly publications. However, GHP URIs are vulnerable to the same reference rot that plagues the Web at large. The disappearance of software hosting platforms, like Gitorious and Google Code, and the source code they contain threatens research reproducibility. Archiving the source code and development history available in GHPs enables the long-term reproducibility of research. Software Heritage and Web archives contain archives of GHP URI resources. However, are the GHP URIs referenced by scholarly publications contained within the Software Heritage and Web archive collections? We analyzed a dataset of GHP URIs extracted from scholarly publications to determine (1) is the URI still publicly available on the live Web?, (2) has the URI been archived by Software Heritage?, and (3) has the URI been archived by Web archives? Of all GHP URIs, we found that 93.98% were still publicly available on the live Web, 68.39% had been archived by Software Heritage, and 81.43% had been archived by Web archives.
