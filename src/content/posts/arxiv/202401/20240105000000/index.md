**ABSTRACT**  
This study investigates the prevalence of violent language on incels.is. It evaluates GPT models (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) for content analysis in social sciences, focusing on the impact of varying prompts and batch sizes on coding quality for the detection of violent speech. We scraped over 6.9M posts from incels.is and categorized a random sample into non-violent, explicitly violent, and implicitly violent content. Two human coders annotated 3,028 posts, which we used to tune and evaluate GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models across different prompts and batch sizes regarding coding reliability. The best-performing GPT-4 model annotated an additional 30,000 posts for further analysis.   Our findings indicate an overall increase in violent speech overtime on incels.is, both at the community and individual level, particularly among more engaged users. While directed violent language decreases, non-directed violent language increases, and self-harm content shows a decline, especially after 2.5 years of user activity. We find substantial agreement between both human coders (K = .65), while the best GPT-4 model yields good agreement with both human coders (K = 0.54 for Human A and K = 0.62 for Human B). Weighted and macro F1 scores further support this alignment.   Overall, this research provides practical means for accurately identifying violent language at a large scale that can aid content moderation and facilitate next-step research into the causal mechanism and potential mitigations of violent expression and radicalization in communities like incels.is.

**ABSTRACT**  
With the development of social media, rumors have been spread broadly on social media platforms, causing great harm to society. Beside textual information, many rumors also use manipulated images or conceal textual information within images to deceive people and avoid being detected, making multimodal rumor detection be a critical problem. The majority of multimodal rumor detection methods mainly concentrate on extracting features of source claims and their corresponding images, while ignoring the comments of rumors and their propagation structures. These comments and structures imply the wisdom of crowds and are proved to be crucial to debunk rumors. Moreover, these methods usually only extract visual features in a basic manner, seldom consider tampering or textual information in images. Therefore, in this study, we propose a novel Vision and Graph Fused Attention Network (VGA) for rumor detection to utilize propagation structures among posts so as to obtain the crowd opinions and further explore visual tampering features, as well as the textual information hidden in images. We conduct extensive experiments on three datasets, demonstrating that VGA can effectively detect multimodal rumors and outperform state-of-the-art methods significantly.

**ABSTRACT**  
In the last years, social media has gained an unprecedented amount of attention, playing a pivotal role in shaping the contemporary landscape of communication and connection. However, Coordinated Inhautentic Behaviour (CIB), defined as orchestrated efforts by entities to deceive or mislead users about their identity and intentions, has emerged as a tactic to exploit the online discourse. In this study, we quantify the efficacy of CIB tactics by defining a general framework for evaluating the influence of a subset of nodes in a directed tree. We design two algorithms that provide optimal and greedy post-hoc placement strategies that lead to maximising the configuration influence. We then consider cascades from information spreading on Twitter to compare the observed behaviour with our algorithms. The results show that, according to our model, coordinated accounts are quite inefficient in terms of their network influence, thus suggesting that they may play a less pivotal role than expected. Moreover, the causes of these poor results may be found in two separate aspects: a bad placement strategy and a scarcity of resources.

**ABSTRACT**  
Anomaly detection on attributed networks aims to find the nodes whose behaviors are significantly different from other majority nodes. Generally, network data contains information about relationships between entities, and the anomaly is usually embodied in these relationships. Therefore, how to comprehensively model complex interaction patterns in networks is still a major focus. It can be observed that anomalies in networks violate the homophily assumption. However, most existing studies only considered this phenomenon obliquely rather than explicitly. Besides, the node representation of normal entities can be perturbed easily by the noise relationships introduced by anomalous nodes. To address the above issues, we present a novel contrastive learning framework for anomaly detection on attributed networks, \textbf{SCALA}, aiming to improve the embedding quality of the network and provide a new measurement of qualifying the anomaly score for each node by introducing sparsification into the conventional method. Extensive experiments are conducted on five benchmark real-world datasets and the results show that SCALA consistently outperforms all baseline methods significantly.

**ABSTRACT**  
While solving complex manipulation tasks, manipulation policies often need to learn a set of diverse skills to accomplish these tasks. The set of skills is often quite multimodal - each one may have a quite distinct distribution of actions and states. Standard deep policy-learning algorithms often model policies as deep neural networks with a single output head (deterministic or stochastic). This structure requires the network to learn to switch between modes internally, which can lead to lower sample efficiency and poor performance. In this paper we explore a simple structure which is conducive to skill learning required for so many of the manipulation tasks. Specifically, we propose a policy architecture that sequentially executes different action heads for fixed durations, enabling the learning of primitive skills such as reaching and grasping. Our empirical evaluation on the Metaworld tasks reveals that this simple structure outperforms standard policy learning methods, highlighting its potential for improved skill acquisition.

**ABSTRACT**  
One of the most critical applications undertaken by coalitions of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) is reaching predefined targets by following the most time-efficient routes while avoiding collisions. Unfortunately, UAVs are hampered by limited battery life, and UGVs face challenges in reachability due to obstacles and elevation variations. Existing literature primarily focuses on one-to-one coalitions, which constrains the efficiency of reaching targets. In this work, we introduce a novel approach for a UAV-UGV coalition with a variable number of vehicles, employing a modified mean-shift clustering algorithm to segment targets into multiple zones. Each vehicle utilizes Multi-agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) and Multi-agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO), two advanced reinforcement learning algorithms, to form an effective coalition for navigating obstructed environments without collisions. This approach of assigning targets to various circular zones, based on density and range, significantly reduces the time required to reach these targets. Moreover, introducing variability in the number of UAVs and UGVs in a coalition enhances task efficiency by enabling simultaneous multi-target engagement. The results of our experimental evaluation demonstrate that our proposed method substantially surpasses current state-of-the-art techniques, nearly doubling efficiency in terms of target navigation time and task completion rate.

**ABSTRACT**  
We propose Guided Positive Sampling Self-Supervised Learning (GPS-SSL), a general method to inject a priori knowledge into Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) positive samples selection. Current SSL methods leverage Data-Augmentations (DA) for generating positive samples and incorporate prior knowledge - an incorrect, or too weak DA will drastically reduce the quality of the learned representation. GPS-SSL proposes instead to design a metric space where Euclidean distances become a meaningful proxy for semantic relationship. In that space, it is now possible to generate positive samples from nearest neighbor sampling. Any prior knowledge can now be embedded into that metric space independently from the employed DA. From its simplicity, GPS-SSL is applicable to any SSL method, e.g. SimCLR or BYOL. A key benefit of GPS-SSL is in reducing the pressure in tailoring strong DAs. For example GPS-SSL reaches 85.58% on Cifar10 with weak DA while the baseline only reaches 37.51%. We therefore move a step forward towards the goal of making SSL less reliant on DA. We also show that even when using strong DAs, GPS-SSL outperforms the baselines on under-studied domains. We evaluate GPS-SSL along with multiple baseline SSL methods on numerous downstream datasets from different domains when the models use strong or minimal data augmentations. We hope that GPS-SSL will open new avenues in studying how to inject a priori knowledge into SSL in a principled manner.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recent advances in visual anomaly detection research have seen AUROC and AUPRO scores on public benchmark datasets such as MVTec and VisA converge towards perfect recall, giving the impression that these benchmarks are near-solved. However, high AUROC and AUPRO scores do not always reflect qualitative performance, which limits the validity of these metrics in real-world applications. We argue that the artificial ceiling imposed by the lack of an adequate evaluation metric restrains progression of the field, and it is crucial that we revisit the evaluation metrics used to rate our algorithms. In response, we introduce Per-IMage Overlap (PIMO), a novel metric that addresses the shortcomings of AUROC and AUPRO. PIMO retains the recall-based nature of the existing metrics but introduces two distinctions: the assignment of curves (and respective area under the curve) is per-image, and its X-axis relies solely on normal images. Measuring recall per image simplifies instance score indexing and is more robust to noisy annotations. As we show, it also accelerates computation and enables the usage of statistical tests to compare models. By imposing low tolerance for false positives on normal images, PIMO provides an enhanced model validation procedure and highlights performance variations across datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that PIMO offers practical advantages and nuanced performance insights that redefine anomaly detection benchmarks -- notably challenging the perception that MVTec AD and VisA datasets have been solved by contemporary models.

**ABSTRACT**  
Visual reasoning is dominated by end-to-end neural networks scaled to billions of model parameters and training examples. However, even the largest models struggle with compositional reasoning, generalization, fine-grained spatial and temporal reasoning, and counting. Visual reasoning with large language models (LLMs) as controllers can, in principle, address these limitations by decomposing the task and solving subtasks by orchestrating a set of (visual) tools. Recently, these models achieved great performance on tasks such as compositional visual question answering, visual grounding, and video temporal reasoning. Nevertheless, in their current form, these models heavily rely on human engineering of in-context examples in the prompt, which are often dataset- and task-specific and require significant labor by highly skilled programmers. In this work, we present a framework that mitigates these issues by introducing spatially and temporally abstract routines and by leveraging a small number of labeled examples to automatically generate in-context examples, thereby avoiding human-created in-context examples. On a number of visual reasoning tasks, we show that our framework leads to consistent gains in performance, makes LLMs as controllers setup more robust, and removes the need for human engineering of in-context examples.

**ABSTRACT**  
What does learning to model relationships between strings teach large language models (LLMs) about the visual world? We systematically evaluate LLMs' abilities to generate and recognize an assortment of visual concepts of increasing complexity and then demonstrate how a preliminary visual representation learning system can be trained using models of text. As language models lack the ability to consume or output visual information as pixels, we use code to represent images in our study. Although LLM-generated images do not look like natural images, results on image generation and the ability of models to correct these generated images indicate that precise modeling of strings can teach language models about numerous aspects of the visual world. Furthermore, experiments on self-supervised visual representation learning, utilizing images generated with text models, highlight the potential to train vision models capable of making semantic assessments of natural images using just LLMs.

**ABSTRACT**  
In recent years, the Vision Transformer (ViT) model has gradually become mainstream in various computer vision tasks, and the robustness of the model has received increasing attention. However, existing large models tend to prioritize performance during training, potentially neglecting the robustness, which may lead to serious security concerns. In this paper, we establish a new challenge: exploring how to use a small number of additional parameters for adversarial finetuning to quickly and effectively enhance the adversarial robustness of a standardly trained model. To address this challenge, we develop the novel LNLoRA module, incorporating a learnable layer normalization before the conventional LoRA module, which helps mitigate magnitude differences in parameters between the adversarial and standard training paradigms.   Furthermore, we propose the FullLoRA-AT framework by integrating the learnable LNLoRA modules into all key components of ViT-based models while keeping the pretrained model frozen, which can significantly improve the model robustness via adversarial finetuning in a parameter-efficient manner.   Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Imagenette demonstrate the superiority of our proposed FullLoRA-AT framework. It achieves comparable robustness with full finetuning while only requiring about 5% of the learnable parameters. This also effectively addresses concerns regarding extra model storage space and enormous training time caused by adversarial finetuning.

**ABSTRACT**  
The attention mechanism has been proven effective on various visual tasks in recent years. In the semantic segmentation task, the attention mechanism is applied in various methods, including the case of both Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT) as backbones. However, we observe that the attention mechanism is vulnerable to patch-based adversarial attacks. Through the analysis of the effective receptive field, we attribute it to the fact that the wide receptive field brought by global attention may lead to the spread of the adversarial patch. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a Robust Attention Mechanism (RAM) to improve the robustness of the semantic segmentation model, which can notably relieve the vulnerability against patch-based attacks. Compared to the vallina attention mechanism, RAM introduces two novel modules called Max Attention Suppression and Random Attention Dropout, both of which aim to refine the attention matrix and limit the influence of a single adversarial patch on the semantic segmentation results of other positions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our RAM to improve the robustness of semantic segmentation models against various patch-based attack methods under different attack settings.

**ABSTRACT**  
Images generated by most of generative models trained with limited data often exhibit deficiencies in either fidelity, diversity, or both. One effective solution to address the limitation is few-shot generative model adaption. However, the type of approaches typically rely on a large-scale pre-trained model, serving as a source domain, to facilitate information transfer to the target domain. In this paper, we propose a method called Information Transfer from the Built Geodesic Surface (ITBGS), which contains two module: Feature Augmentation on Geodesic Surface (FAGS); Interpolation and Regularization (I\&R). With the FAGS module, a pseudo-source domain is created by projecting image features from the training dataset into the Pre-Shape Space, subsequently generating new features on the Geodesic surface. Thus, no pre-trained models is needed for the adaption process during the training of generative models with FAGS. I\&R module are introduced for supervising the interpolated images and regularizing their relative distances, respectively, to further enhance the quality of generated images. Through qualitative and quantitative experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed method consistently achieves optimal or comparable results across a diverse range of semantically distinct datasets, even in extremely few-shot scenarios.

**ABSTRACT**  
Multi-modal (vision-language) models, such as CLIP, are replacing traditional supervised pre-training models (e.g., ImageNet-based pre-training) as the new generation of visual foundation models. These models with robust and aligned semantic representations learned from billions of internet image-text pairs and can be applied to various downstream tasks in a zero-shot manner. However, in some fine-grained domains like medical imaging and remote sensing, the performance of multi-modal foundation models often leaves much to be desired. Consequently, many researchers have begun to explore few-shot adaptation methods for these models, gradually deriving three main technical approaches: 1) prompt-based methods, 2) adapter-based methods, and 3) external knowledge-based methods. Nevertheless, this rapidly developing field has produced numerous results without a comprehensive survey to systematically organize the research progress. Therefore, in this survey, we introduce and analyze the research advancements in few-shot adaptation methods for multi-modal models, summarizing commonly used datasets and experimental setups, and comparing the results of different methods. In addition, due to the lack of reliable theoretical support for existing methods, we derive the few-shot adaptation generalization error bound for multi-modal models. The theorem reveals that the generalization error of multi-modal foundation models is constrained by three factors: domain gap, model capacity, and sample size. Based on this, we propose three possible solutions from the following aspects: 1) adaptive domain generalization, 2) adaptive model selection, and 3) adaptive knowledge utilization.

**ABSTRACT**  
JPEG is a widely used compression scheme to efficiently reduce the volume of transmitted images. The artifacts appear among blocks due to the information loss, which not only affects the quality of images but also harms the subsequent high-level tasks in terms of feature drifting. High-level vision models trained on high-quality images will suffer performance degradation when dealing with compressed images, especially on mobile devices. Numerous learning-based JPEG artifact removal methods have been proposed to handle visual artifacts. However, it is not an ideal choice to use these JPEG artifact removal methods as a pre-processing for compressed image classification for the following reasons: 1. These methods are designed for human vision rather than high-level vision models; 2. These methods are not efficient enough to serve as pre-processing on resource-constrained devices. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel lightweight AFD module to boost the performance of pre-trained image classification models when facing compressed images. First, a FDE-Net is devised to generate the spatial-wise FDM in the DCT domain. Next, the estimated FDM is transmitted to the FE-Net to generate the mapping relationship between degraded features and corresponding high-quality features. A simple but effective RepConv block equipped with structural re-parameterization is utilized in FE-Net, which enriches feature representation in the training phase while maintaining efficiency in the deployment phase. After training on limited compressed images, the AFD-Module can serve as a "plug-and-play" model for pre-trained classification models to improve their performance on compressed images. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed AFD module can comprehensively improve the accuracy of the pre-trained classification models and significantly outperform the existing methods.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper introduces the WordArt Designer API, a novel framework for user-driven artistic typography synthesis utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) on ModelScope. We address the challenge of simplifying artistic typography for non-professionals by offering a dynamic, adaptive, and computationally efficient alternative to traditional rigid templates. Our approach leverages the power of LLMs to understand and interpret user input, facilitating a more intuitive design process. We demonstrate through various case studies how users can articulate their aesthetic preferences and functional requirements, which the system then translates into unique and creative typographic designs. Our evaluations indicate significant improvements in user satisfaction, design flexibility, and creative expression over existing systems. The WordArt Designer API not only democratizes the art of typography but also opens up new possibilities for personalized digital communication and design.

**ABSTRACT**  
Deep learning has shown great potential in accelerating diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Nevertheless, existing methods tend to suffer from Rician noise and detail loss in reconstructing the DTI-derived parametric maps especially when sparsely sampled q-space data are used. This paper proposes a novel method, AID-DTI (Accelerating hIgh fiDelity Diffusion Tensor Imaging), to facilitate fast and accurate DTI with only six measurements. AID-DTI is equipped with a newly designed Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)-based regularizer, which can effectively capture fine details while suppressing noise during network training. Experimental results on Human Connectome Project (HCP) data consistently demonstrate that the proposed method estimates DTI parameter maps with fine-grained details and outperforms three state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.

**ABSTRACT**  
Many RGBT tracking researches primarily focus on modal fusion design, while overlooking the effective handling of target appearance changes. While some approaches have introduced historical frames or fuse and replace initial templates to incorporate temporal information, they have the risk of disrupting the original target appearance and accumulating errors over time. To alleviate these limitations, we propose a novel Transformer RGBT tracking approach, which mixes spatio-temporal multimodal tokens from the static multimodal templates and multimodal search regions in Transformer to handle target appearance changes, for robust RGBT tracking. We introduce independent dynamic template tokens to interact with the search region, embedding temporal information to address appearance changes, while also retaining the involvement of the initial static template tokens in the joint feature extraction process to ensure the preservation of the original reliable target appearance information that prevent deviations from the target appearance caused by traditional temporal updates. We also use attention mechanisms to enhance the target features of multimodal template tokens by incorporating supplementary modal cues, and make the multimodal search region tokens interact with multimodal dynamic template tokens via attention mechanisms, which facilitates the conveyance of multimodal-enhanced target change information. Our module is inserted into the transformer backbone network and inherits joint feature extraction, search-template matching, and cross-modal interaction. Extensive experiments on three RGBT benchmark datasets show that the proposed approach maintains competitive performance compared to other state-of-the-art tracking algorithms while running at 39.1 FPS.

**ABSTRACT**  
Object detection models represented by YOLO series have been widely used and have achieved great results on the high quality datasets, but not all the working conditions are ideal. To settle down the problem of locating targets on low quality datasets, the existing methods either train a new object detection network, or need a large collection of low-quality datasets to train. However, we propose a framework in this paper and apply it on the YOLO models called DiffYOLO. Specifically, we extract feature maps from the denoising diffusion probabilistic models to enhance the well-trained models, which allows us fine-tune YOLO on high-quality datasets and test on low-quality datasets. The results proved this framework can not only prove the performance on noisy datasets, but also prove the detection results on high-quality test datasets. We will supplement more experiments later (with various datasets and network architectures).

**ABSTRACT**  
The burgeoning field of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) is witnessing rapid advancements, particularly in video generation. This paper introduces AIGCBench, a pioneering comprehensive and scalable benchmark designed to evaluate a variety of video generation tasks, with a primary focus on Image-to-Video (I2V) generation. AIGCBench tackles the limitations of existing benchmarks, which suffer from a lack of diverse datasets, by including a varied and open-domain image-text dataset that evaluates different state-of-the-art algorithms under equivalent conditions. We employ a novel text combiner and GPT-4 to create rich text prompts, which are then used to generate images via advanced Text-to-Image models. To establish a unified evaluation framework for video generation tasks, our benchmark includes 11 metrics spanning four dimensions to assess algorithm performance. These dimensions are control-video alignment, motion effects, temporal consistency, and video quality. These metrics are both reference video-dependent and video-free, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation strategy. The evaluation standard proposed correlates well with human judgment, providing insights into the strengths and weaknesses of current I2V algorithms. The findings from our extensive experiments aim to stimulate further research and development in the I2V field. AIGCBench represents a significant step toward creating standardized benchmarks for the broader AIGC landscape, proposing an adaptable and equitable framework for future assessments of video generation tasks. We have open-sourced the dataset and evaluation code on the project website: https://www.benchcouncil.org/AIGCBench.

**ABSTRACT**  
Stereo matching and semantic segmentation are significant tasks in binocular satellite 3D reconstruction. However, previous studies primarily view these as independent parallel tasks, lacking an integrated multitask learning framework. This work introduces a solution, the Single-branch Semantic Stereo Network (S3Net), which innovatively combines semantic segmentation and stereo matching using Self-Fuse and Mutual-Fuse modules. Unlike preceding methods that utilize semantic or disparity information independently, our method dentifies and leverages the intrinsic link between these two tasks, leading to a more accurate understanding of semantic information and disparity estimation. Comparative testing on the US3D dataset proves the effectiveness of our S3Net. Our model improves the mIoU in semantic segmentation from 61.38 to 67.39, and reduces the D1-Error and average endpoint error (EPE) in disparity estimation from 10.051 to 9.579 and 1.439 to 1.403 respectively, surpassing existing competitive methods.

**ABSTRACT**  
RGB-T semantic segmentation is a key technique for autonomous driving scenes understanding. For the existing RGB-T semantic segmentation methods, however, the effective exploration of the complementary relationship between different modalities is not implemented in the information interaction between multiple levels. To address such an issue, the Context-Aware Interaction Network (CAINet) is proposed for RGB-T semantic segmentation, which constructs interaction space to exploit auxiliary tasks and global context for explicitly guided learning. Specifically, we propose a Context-Aware Complementary Reasoning (CACR) module aimed at establishing the complementary relationship between multimodal features with the long-term context in both spatial and channel dimensions. Further, considering the importance of global contextual and detailed information, we propose the Global Context Modeling (GCM) module and Detail Aggregation (DA) module, and we introduce specific auxiliary supervision to explicitly guide the context interaction and refine the segmentation map. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets of MFNet and PST900 demonstrate that the proposed CAINet achieves state-of-the-art performance. The code is available at https://github.com/YingLv1106/CAINet.

**ABSTRACT**  
Striking a balance between precision and efficiency presents a prominent challenge in the bird's-eye-view (BEV) 3D object detection. Although previous camera-based BEV methods achieved remarkable performance by incorporating long-term temporal information, most of them still face the problem of low efficiency. One potential solution is knowledge distillation. Existing distillation methods only focus on reconstructing spatial features, while overlooking temporal knowledge. To this end, we propose TempDistiller, a Temporal knowledge Distiller, to acquire long-term memory from a teacher detector when provided with a limited number of frames. Specifically, a reconstruction target is formulated by integrating long-term temporal knowledge through self-attention operation applied to feature teachers. Subsequently, novel features are generated for masked student features via a generator. Ultimately, we utilize this reconstruction target to reconstruct the student features. In addition, we also explore temporal relational knowledge when inputting full frames for the student model. We verify the effectiveness of the proposed method on the nuScenes benchmark. The experimental results show our method obtain an enhancement of +1.6 mAP and +1.1 NDS compared to the baseline, a speed improvement of approximately 6 FPS after compressing temporal knowledge, and the most accurate velocity estimation.

**ABSTRACT**  
Few-shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) aims to continuously learn new classes based on very limited training data without forgetting the old ones encountered. Existing studies solely relied on pure visual networks, while in this paper we solved FSCIL by leveraging the Vision-Language model (e.g., CLIP) and propose a simple yet effective framework, named Learning Prompt with Distribution-based Feature Replay (LP-DiF). We observe that simply using CLIP for zero-shot evaluation can substantially outperform the most influential methods. Then, prompt tuning technique is involved to further improve its adaptation ability, allowing the model to continually capture specific knowledge from each session. To prevent the learnable prompt from forgetting old knowledge in the new session, we propose a pseudo-feature replay approach. Specifically, we preserve the old knowledge of each class by maintaining a feature-level Gaussian distribution with a diagonal covariance matrix, which is estimated by the image features of training images and synthesized features generated from a VAE. When progressing to a new session, pseudo-features are sampled from old-class distributions combined with training images of the current session to optimize the prompt, thus enabling the model to learn new knowledge while retaining old knowledge. Experiments on three prevalent benchmarks, i.e., CIFAR100, mini-ImageNet, CUB-200, and two more challenging benchmarks, i.e., SUN-397 and CUB-200$^*$ proposed in this paper showcase the superiority of LP-DiF, achieving new state-of-the-art (SOTA) in FSCIL.

**ABSTRACT**  
Existing contrastive language-image pre-training aims to learn a joint representation by matching abundant image-text pairs. However, the number of image-text pairs in medical datasets is usually orders of magnitude smaller than that in natural datasets. Besides, medical image-text pairs often involve numerous complex fine-grained correspondences. This paper aims to enhance the data efficiency by introducing multiple-to-multiple local relationship modeling to capture denser supervisions. More specifically, we propose a Medical Language-Image Pre-training (MLIP) framework, which exploits the limited image-text medical data more efficiently through patch-sentence matching. Furthermore, we introduce a masked contrastive learning strategy with semantic integrity estimation to reduce redundancy in images while preserving the underlying semantics. Our evaluation results show that MLIP outperforms previous work in zero/few-shot classification and few-shot segmentation tasks by a large margin.

**ABSTRACT**  
The elderly population is increasing rapidly around the world. There are no enough caretakers for them. Use of AI-based in-home medical care systems is gaining momentum due to this. Human fall detection is one of the most important tasks of medical care system for the aged people. Human fall is a common problem among elderly people. Detection of a fall and providing medical help as early as possible is very important to reduce any further complexity. The chances of death and other medical complications can be reduced by detecting and providing medical help as early as possible after the fall. There are many state-of-the-art fall detection techniques available these days, but the majority of them need very high computing power. In this paper, we proposed a lightweight and fast human fall detection system using pose estimation. We used `Movenet' for human joins key-points extraction. Our proposed method can work in real-time on any low-computing device with any basic camera. All computation can be processed locally, so there is no problem of privacy of the subject. We used two datasets `GMDCSA' and `URFD' for the experiment. We got the sensitivity value of 0.9375 and 0.9167 for the dataset `GMDCSA' and `URFD' respectively. The source code and the dataset GMDCSA of our work are available online to access.

**ABSTRACT**  
Spatio-temporal video grounding (or STVG) task aims at locating a spatio-temporal tube for a specific instance given a text query. Despite advancements, current methods easily suffer the distractors or heavy object appearance variations in videos due to insufficient object information from the text, leading to degradation. Addressing this, we propose a novel framework, context-guided STVG (CG-STVG), which mines discriminative instance context for object in videos and applies it as a supplementary guidance for target localization. The key of CG-STVG lies in two specially designed modules, including instance context generation (ICG), which focuses on discovering visual context information (in both appearance and motion) of the instance, and instance context refinement (ICR), which aims to improve the instance context from ICG by eliminating irrelevant or even harmful information from the context. During grounding, ICG, together with ICR, are deployed at each decoding stage of a Transformer architecture for instance context learning. Particularly, instance context learned from one decoding stage is fed to the next stage, and leveraged as a guidance containing rich and discriminative object feature to enhance the target-awareness in decoding feature, which conversely benefits generating better new instance context for improving localization finally. Compared to existing methods, CG-STVG enjoys object information in text query and guidance from mined instance visual context for more accurate target localization. In our experiments on three benchmarks, including HCSTVG-v1/-v2 and VidSTG, CG-STVG sets new state-of-the-arts in m_tIoU and m_vIoU on all of them, showing its efficacy. The code will be released at https://github.com/HengLan/CGSTVG.

**ABSTRACT**  
Despite the recent remarkable achievement in gaze estimation, efficient and accurate personalization of gaze estimation without labels is a practical problem but rarely touched on in the literature. To achieve efficient personalization, we take inspiration from the recent advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) by updating a negligible number of parameters, "prompts", at the test time. Specifically, the prompt is additionally attached without perturbing original network and can contain less than 1% of a ResNet-18's parameters. Our experiments show high efficiency of the prompt tuning approach. The proposed one can be 10 times faster in terms of adaptation speed than the methods compared. However, it is non-trivial to update the prompt for personalized gaze estimation without labels. At the test time, it is essential to ensure that the minimizing of particular unsupervised loss leads to the goals of minimizing gaze estimation error. To address this difficulty, we propose to meta-learn the prompt to ensure that its updates align with the goal. Our experiments show that the meta-learned prompt can be effectively adapted even with a simple symmetry loss. In addition, we experiment on four cross-dataset validations to show the remarkable advantages of the proposed method.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper addresses the task of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) visual geo-localization, which aims to match images of the same geographic target taken by different platforms, i.e., UAVs and satellites. In general, the key to achieving accurate UAV-satellite image matching lies in extracting visual features that are robust against viewpoint changes, scale variations, and rotations. Current works have shown that part matching is crucial for UAV visual geo-localization since part-level representations can capture image details and help to understand the semantic information of scenes. However, the importance of preserving semantic characteristics in part-level representations is not well discussed. In this paper, we introduce a transformer-based adaptive semantic aggregation method that regards parts as the most representative semantics in an image. Correlations of image patches to different parts are learned in terms of the transformer's feature map. Then our method decomposes part-level features into an adaptive sum of all patch features. By doing this, the learned parts are encouraged to focus on patches with typical semantics. Extensive experiments on the University-1652 dataset have shown the superiority of our method over the current works.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recently, many algorithms have employed image-adaptive lookup tables (LUTs) to achieve real-time image enhancement. Nonetheless, a prevailing trend among existing methods has been the employment of linear combinations of basic LUTs to formulate image-adaptive LUTs, which limits the generalization ability of these methods. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework named AttentionLut for real-time image enhancement, which utilizes the attention mechanism to generate image-adaptive LUTs. Our proposed framework consists of three lightweight modules. We begin by employing the global image context feature module to extract image-adaptive features. Subsequently, the attention fusion module integrates the image feature with the priori attention feature obtained during training to generate image-adaptive canonical polyadic tensors. Finally, the canonical polyadic reconstruction module is deployed to reconstruct image-adaptive residual 3DLUT, which is subsequently utilized for enhancing input images. Experiments on the benchmark MIT-Adobe FiveK dataset demonstrate that the proposed method achieves better enhancement performance quantitatively and qualitatively than the state-of-the-art methods.

**ABSTRACT**  
Point cloud completion is an indispensable task for recovering complete point clouds due to incompleteness caused by occlusion, limited sensor resolution, etc. The family of coarse-to-fine generation architectures has recently exhibited great success in point cloud completion and gradually became mainstream. In this work, we unveil one of the key ingredients behind these methods: meticulously devised feature extraction operations with explicit cross-resolution aggregation. We present Cross-Resolution Transformer that efficiently performs cross-resolution aggregation with local attention mechanisms. With the help of our recursive designs, the proposed operation can capture more scales of features than common aggregation operations, which is beneficial for capturing fine geometric characteristics. While prior methodologies have ventured into various manifestations of inter-level cross-resolution aggregation, the effectiveness of intra-level one and their combination has not been analyzed. With unified designs, Cross-Resolution Transformer can perform intra- or inter-level cross-resolution aggregation by switching inputs. We integrate two forms of Cross-Resolution Transformers into one up-sampling block for point generation, and following the coarse-to-fine manner, we construct CRA-PCN to incrementally predict complete shapes with stacked up-sampling blocks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin on several widely used benchmarks. Codes are available at https://github.com/EasyRy/CRA-PCN.

**ABSTRACT**  
Quantization is of significance for compressing the over-parameterized deep neural models and deploying them on resource-limited devices. Fixed-precision quantization suffers from performance drop due to the limited numerical representation ability. Conversely, mixed-precision quantization (MPQ) is advocated to compress the model effectively by allocating heterogeneous bit-width for layers. MPQ is typically organized into a searching-retraining two-stage process. Previous works only focus on determining the optimal bit-width configuration in the first stage efficiently, while ignoring the considerable time costs in the second stage. However, retraining always consumes hundreds of GPU-hours on the cutting-edge GPUs, thus hindering deployment efficiency significantly. In this paper, we devise a one-shot training-searching paradigm for mixed-precision model compression. Specifically, in the first stage, all potential bit-width configurations are coupled and thus optimized simultaneously within a set of shared weights. However, our observations reveal a previously unseen and severe bit-width interference phenomenon among highly coupled weights during optimization, leading to considerable performance degradation under a high compression ratio. To tackle this problem, we first design a bit-width scheduler to dynamically freeze the most turbulent bit-width of layers during training, to ensure the rest bit-widths converged properly. Then, taking inspiration from information theory, we present an information distortion mitigation technique to align the behaviour of the bad-performing bit-widths to the well-performing ones.

**ABSTRACT**  
Video Question Answering (VideoQA) has emerged as a vital tool to evaluate agents' ability to understand human daily behaviors. Despite the recent success of large vision language models in many multi-modal tasks, complex situation reasoning over videos involving multiple human-object interaction events still remains challenging. In contrast, humans can easily tackle it by using a series of episode memories as anchors to quickly locate question-related key moments for reasoning. To mimic this effective reasoning strategy, we propose the Glance-Focus model. One simple way is to apply an action detection model to predict a set of actions as key memories. However, these actions within a closed set vocabulary are hard to generalize to various video domains. Instead of that, we train an Encoder-Decoder to generate a set of dynamic event memories at the glancing stage. Apart from using supervised bipartite matching to obtain the event memories, we further design an unsupervised memory generation method to get rid of dependence on event annotations. Next, at the focusing stage, these event memories act as a bridge to establish the correlation between the questions with high-level event concepts and low-level lengthy video content. Given the question, the model first focuses on the generated key event memory, then focuses on the most relevant moment for reasoning through our designed multi-level cross-attention mechanism. We conduct extensive experiments on four Multi-Event VideoQA benchmarks including STAR, EgoTaskQA, AGQA, and NExT-QA. Our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing current large models in various challenging reasoning tasks.

**ABSTRACT**  
While significant advancements have been made in video question answering (VideoQA), the potential benefits of enhancing model generalization through tailored difficulty scheduling have been largely overlooked in existing research. This paper seeks to bridge that gap by incorporating VideoQA into a curriculum learning (CL) framework that progressively trains models from simpler to more complex data. Recognizing that conventional self-paced CL methods rely on training loss for difficulty measurement, which might not accurately reflect the intricacies of video-question pairs, we introduce the concept of uncertainty-aware CL. Here, uncertainty serves as the guiding principle for dynamically adjusting the difficulty. Furthermore, we address the challenge posed by uncertainty by presenting a probabilistic modeling approach for VideoQA. Specifically, we conceptualize VideoQA as a stochastic computation graph, where the hidden representations are treated as stochastic variables. This yields two distinct types of uncertainty: one related to the inherent uncertainty in the data and another pertaining to the model's confidence. In practice, we seamlessly integrate the VideoQA model into our framework and conduct comprehensive experiments. The findings affirm that our approach not only achieves enhanced performance but also effectively quantifies uncertainty in the context of VideoQA.

Reasoning over sports videos for question answering is an important task with numerous applications, such as player training and information retrieval. However, this task has not been explored due to the lack of relevant datasets and the challenging nature it presents. Most datasets for video question answering (VideoQA) focus mainly on general and coarse-grained understanding of daily-life videos, which is not applicable to sports scenarios requiring professional action understanding and fine-grained motion analysis. In this paper, we introduce the first dataset, named Sports-QA, specifically designed for the sports VideoQA task. The Sports-QA dataset includes various types of questions, such as descriptions, chronologies, causalities, and counterfactual conditions, covering multiple sports. Furthermore, to address the characteristics of the sports VideoQA task, we propose a new Auto-Focus Transformer (AFT) capable of automatically focusing on particular scales of temporal information for question answering. We conduct extensive experiments on Sports-QA, including baseline studies and the evaluation of different methods. The results demonstrate that our AFT achieves state-of-the-art performance.

**ABSTRACT**  
Vision transformers (ViTs) have achieved promising results on a variety of Computer Vision tasks, however their quadratic complexity in the number of input tokens has limited their application specially in resource-constrained settings. Previous approaches that employ gradual token reduction to address this challenge assume that token redundancy in one layer implies redundancy in all the following layers. We empirically demonstrate that this assumption is often not correct, i.e., tokens that are redundant in one layer can be useful in later layers. We employ this key insight to propose a novel token propagation controller (TPC) that incorporates two different token-distributions, i.e., pause probability and restart probability to control the reduction and reuse of tokens respectively, which results in more efficient token utilization. To improve the estimates of token distributions, we propose a smoothing mechanism that acts as a regularizer and helps remove noisy outliers. Furthermore, to improve the training-stability of our proposed TPC, we introduce a model stabilizer that is able to implicitly encode local image structures and minimize accuracy fluctuations during model training. We present extensive experimental results on the ImageNet-1K dataset using DeiT, LV-ViT and Swin models to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. For example, compared to baseline models, our proposed method improves the inference speed of the DeiT-S by 250% while increasing the classification accuracy by 1.0%.

**ABSTRACT**  
We characterize and study zero-shot abstractive summarization in Large Language Models (LLMs) by measuring position bias, which we propose as a general formulation of the more restrictive lead bias phenomenon studied previously in the literature. Position bias captures the tendency of a model unfairly prioritizing information from certain parts of the input text over others, leading to undesirable behavior. Through numerous experiments on four diverse real-world datasets, we study position bias in multiple LLM models such as GPT 3.5-Turbo, Llama-2, and Dolly-v2, as well as state-of-the-art pretrained encoder-decoder abstractive summarization models such as Pegasus and BART. Our findings lead to novel insights and discussion on performance and position bias of models for zero-shot summarization tasks.

**ABSTRACT**  
While alignment algorithms are now commonly used to tune pre-trained language models towards a user's preferences, we lack explanations for the underlying mechanisms in which models become ``aligned'', thus making it difficult to explain phenomena like jailbreaks. In this work we study a popular algorithm, direct preference optimization (DPO), and the mechanisms by which it reduces toxicity. Namely, we first study how toxicity is represented and elicited in a pre-trained language model, GPT2-medium. We then apply DPO with a carefully crafted pairwise dataset to reduce toxicity. We examine how the resulting model averts toxic outputs, and find that capabilities learned from pre-training are not removed, but rather bypassed. We use this insight to demonstrate a simple method to un-align the model, reverting it back to its toxic behavior.

**ABSTRACT**  
The increasing use of tools and solutions based on Large Language Models (LLMs) for various tasks in the medical domain has become a prominent trend. Their use in this highly critical and sensitive domain has thus raised important questions about their robustness, especially in response to variations in input, and the reliability of the generated outputs. This study addresses these questions by constructing a textual dataset based on the ICD-10-CM code descriptions, widely used in US hospitals and containing many clinical terms, and their easily reproducible rephrasing. We then benchmarked existing embedding models, either generalist or specialized in the clinical domain, in a semantic search task where the goal was to correctly match the rephrased text to the original description. Our results showed that generalist models performed better than clinical models, suggesting that existing clinical specialized models are more sensitive to small changes in input that confuse them. The highlighted problem of specialized models may be due to the fact that they have not been trained on sufficient data, and in particular on datasets that are not diverse enough to have a reliable global language understanding, which is still necessary for accurate handling of medical documents.

**ABSTRACT**  
As instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) gain global adoption, their ability to follow instructions in multiple languages becomes increasingly crucial. One promising approach is cross-lingual transfer, where a model acquires specific functionality on some language by finetuning on another language. In this work, we investigate how multilinguality during instruction tuning of a multilingual LLM affects instruction-following across languages. We first show that many languages transfer some instruction-following capabilities to other languages from even monolingual tuning. Furthermore, we find that only 40 multilingual examples in an English tuning set substantially improve multilingual instruction-following, both in seen and unseen languages during tuning. In general, we observe that models tuned on multilingual mixtures exhibit comparable or superior performance in several languages compared to monolingually tuned models, despite training on 10x fewer examples in those languages. Finally, we find that increasing the number of languages in the instruction tuning set from 1 to only 2, 3, or 4 increases cross-lingual generalization. Our results suggest that building massively multilingual instruction-tuned models can be done with only a very small set of multilingual instruction-responses.

**ABSTRACT**  
One of the final frontiers in the development of complex human - AI collaborative systems is the ability of AI agents to comprehend the natural language and perform tasks accordingly. However, training efficient Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents grounded in natural language has been a long-standing challenge due to the complexity and ambiguity of the language and sparsity of the rewards, among other factors. Several advances in reinforcement learning, curriculum learning, continual learning, language models have independently contributed to effective training of grounded agents in various environments. Leveraging these developments, we present a novel algorithm, Grounded Language Instruction through DEmonstration in RL (GLIDE-RL) that introduces a teacher-instructor-student curriculum learning framework for training an RL agent capable of following natural language instructions that can generalize to previously unseen language instructions. In this multi-agent framework, the teacher and the student agents learn simultaneously based on the student's current skill level. We further demonstrate the necessity for training the student agent with not just one, but multiple teacher agents. Experiments on a complex sparse reward environment validates the effectiveness of our proposed approach.

**ABSTRACT**  
Using large training datasets enhances the generalization capabilities of neural networks. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) is useful when there are few labeled data and a lot of unlabeled data. SSL methods that use data augmentation are most successful for image datasets. In contrast, texts do not have consistent augmentation methods as images. Consequently, methods that use augmentation are not as effective in text data as they are in image data. In this study, we compared SSL algorithms that do not require augmentation; these are self-training, co-training, tri-training, and tri-training with disagreement. In the experiments, we used 4 different text datasets for different tasks. We examined the algorithms from a variety of perspectives by asking experiment questions and suggested several improvements. Among the algorithms, tri-training with disagreement showed the closest performance to the Oracle; however, performance gap shows that new semi-supervised algorithms or improvements in existing methods are needed.

**ABSTRACT**  
Data augmentation is an effective technique for improving the performance of machine learning models. However, it has not been explored as extensively in natural language processing (NLP) as it has in computer vision. In this paper, we propose a novel text augmentation method that leverages the Fill-Mask feature of the transformer-based BERT model. Our method involves iteratively masking words in a sentence and replacing them with language model predictions. We have tested our proposed method on various NLP tasks and found it to be effective in many cases. Our results are presented along with a comparison to existing augmentation methods. Experimental results show that our proposed method significantly improves performance, especially on topic classification datasets.

**ABSTRACT**  
While Large Language Models (LLM) are able to accumulate and restore knowledge, they are still prone to hallucination. Especially when faced with factual questions, LLM cannot only rely on knowledge stored in parameters to guarantee truthful and correct answers. Augmenting these models with the ability to search on external information sources, such as the web, is a promising approach to ground knowledge to retrieve information. However, searching in a large collection of documents introduces additional computational/time costs. An optimal behavior would be to query external resources only when the LLM is not confident about answers. In this paper, we propose a new LLM able to self-estimate if it is able to answer directly or needs to request an external tool. We investigate a supervised approach by introducing a hallucination masking mechanism in which labels are generated using a close book question-answering task. In addition, we propose to leverage parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques to train our model on a small amount of data. Our model directly provides answers for $78.2\%$ of the known queries and opts to search for $77.2\%$ of the unknown ones. This results in the API being utilized only $62\%$ of the time.

**ABSTRACT**  
Cross-target stance detection (CTSD) is an important task, which infers the attitude of the destination target by utilizing annotated data derived from the source target. One important approach in CTSD is to extract domain-invariant features to bridge the knowledge gap between multiple targets. However, the analysis of informal and short text structure, and implicit expressions, complicate the extraction of domain-invariant knowledge. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Perspective Prompt-Tuning (MPPT) model for CTSD that uses the analysis perspective as a bridge to transfer knowledge. First, we develop a two-stage instruct-based chain-of-thought method (TsCoT) to elicit target analysis perspectives and provide natural language explanations (NLEs) from multiple viewpoints by formulating instructions based on large language model (LLM). Second, we propose a multi-perspective prompt-tuning framework (MultiPLN) to fuse the NLEs into the stance predictor. Extensive experiments results demonstrate the superiority of MPPT against the state-of-the-art baseline methods.

**ABSTRACT**  
Conversational question answering systems often rely on semantic parsing to enable interactive information retrieval, which involves the generation of structured database queries from a natural language input. For information-seeking conversations about facts stored within a knowledge graph, dialogue utterances are transformed into graph queries in a process that is called knowledge-based conversational question answering. This paper evaluates the performance of large language models that have not been explicitly pre-trained on this task. Through a series of experiments on an extensive benchmark dataset, we compare models of varying sizes with different prompting techniques and identify common issue types in the generated output. Our results demonstrate that large language models are capable of generating graph queries from dialogues, with significant improvements achievable through few-shot prompting and fine-tuning techniques, especially for smaller models that exhibit lower zero-shot performance.

**ABSTRACT**  
Language similarities can be caused by genetic relatedness, areal contact, universality, or chance. Colexification, i.e. a type of similarity where a single lexical form is used to convey multiple meanings, is underexplored. In our work, we shed light on the linguistic causes of cross-lingual similarity in colexification and phonology, by exploring genealogical stability (persistence) and contact-induced change (diffusibility). We construct large-scale graphs incorporating semantic, genealogical, phonological and geographical data for 1,966 languages. We then show the potential of this resource, by investigating several established hypotheses from previous work in linguistics, while proposing new ones. Our results strongly support a previously established hypothesis in the linguistic literature, while offering contradicting evidence to another. Our large scale resource opens for further research across disciplines, e.g.~in multilingual NLP and comparative linguistics.

**ABSTRACT**  
Effective collaboration requires groups to strategically regulate themselves to overcome challenges. Research has shown that groups may fail to regulate due to differences in members' perceptions of challenges which may benefit from external support. In this study, we investigated the potential of leveraging three distinct natural language processing models: an expert knowledge rule-based model, a supervised machine learning (ML) model and a Large Language model (LLM), in challenge detection and challenge dimension identification (cognitive, metacognitive, emotional and technical/other challenges) from student discourse, was investigated. The results show that the supervised ML and the LLM approaches performed considerably well in both tasks, in contrast to the rule-based approach, whose efficacy heavily relies on the engineered features by experts. The paper provides an extensive discussion of the three approaches' performance for automated detection and support of students' challenge moments in collaborative learning activities. It argues that, although LLMs provide many advantages, they are unlikely to be the panacea to issues of the detection and feedback provision of socially shared regulation of learning due to their lack of reliability, as well as issues of validity evaluation, privacy and confabulation. We conclude the paper with a discussion on additional considerations, including model transparency to explore feasible and meaningful analytical feedback for students and educators using LLMs.

**ABSTRACT**  
While Transformer-based pre-trained language models and their variants exhibit strong semantic representation capabilities, the question of comprehending the information gain derived from the additional components of PLMs remains an open question in this field. Motivated by recent efforts that prove Multilayer-Perceptrons (MLPs) modules achieving robust structural capture capabilities, even outperforming Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), this paper aims to quantify whether simple MLPs can further enhance the already potent ability of PLMs to capture linguistic information. Specifically, we design a simple yet effective probing framework containing MLPs components based on BERT structure and conduct extensive experiments encompassing 10 probing tasks spanning three distinct linguistic levels. The experimental results demonstrate that MLPs can indeed enhance the comprehension of linguistic structure by PLMs. Our research provides interpretable and valuable insights into crafting variations of PLMs utilizing MLPs for tasks that emphasize diverse linguistic structures.

**ABSTRACT**  
Social media advertisements are key for brand marketing, aiming to attract consumers with captivating captions and pictures or logos. While previous research has focused on generating captions for general images, incorporating brand personalities into social media captioning remains unexplored. Brand personalities are shown to be affecting consumers' behaviours and social interactions and thus are proven to be a key aspect of marketing strategies. Current open-source multimodal LLMs are not directly suited for this task. Hence, we propose a pipeline solution to assist brands in creating engaging social media captions that align with the image and the brand personalities. Our architecture is based on two parts: a the first part contains an image captioning model that takes in an image that the brand wants to post online and gives a plain English caption; b the second part takes in the generated caption along with the target brand personality and outputs a catchy personality-aligned social media caption. Along with brand personality, our system also gives users the flexibility to provide hashtags, Instagram handles, URLs, and named entities they want the caption to contain, making the captions more semantically related to the social media handles. Comparative evaluations against various baselines demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

**ABSTRACT**  
Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities in understanding and interacting with natural language across various sectors. However, their effectiveness is limited in specialized areas requiring high accuracy, such as plant science, due to a lack of specific expertise in these fields. This paper introduces PLLaMa, an open-source language model that evolved from LLaMa-2. It's enhanced with a comprehensive database, comprising more than 1.5 million scholarly articles in plant science. This development significantly enriches PLLaMa with extensive knowledge and proficiency in plant and agricultural sciences. Our initial tests, involving specific datasets related to plants and agriculture, show that PLLaMa substantially improves its understanding of plant science-related topics. Moreover, we have formed an international panel of professionals, including plant scientists, agricultural engineers, and plant breeders. This team plays a crucial role in verifying the accuracy of PLLaMa's responses to various academic inquiries, ensuring its effective and reliable application in the field. To support further research and development, we have made the model's checkpoints and source codes accessible to the scientific community.

**ABSTRACT**  
Hallucinations are a type of output error produced by deep neural networks. While this has been studied in natural language processing, they have not been researched previously in automatic speech recognition. Here, we define hallucinations in ASR as transcriptions generated by a model that are semantically unrelated to the source utterance, yet still fluent and coherent. The similarity of hallucinations to probable natural language outputs of the model creates a danger of deception and impacts the credibility of the system. We show that commonly used metrics, such as word error rates, cannot differentiate between hallucinatory and non-hallucinatory models. To address this, we propose a perturbation-based method for assessing the susceptibility of an automatic speech recognition (ASR) model to hallucination at test time, which does not require access to the training dataset. We demonstrate that this method helps to distinguish between hallucinatory and non-hallucinatory models that have similar baseline word error rates. We further explore the relationship between the types of ASR errors and the types of dataset noise to determine what types of noise are most likely to create hallucinatory outputs. We devise a framework for identifying hallucinations by analysing their semantic connection with the ground truth and their fluency. Finally, we discover how to induce hallucinations with a random noise injection to the utterance.

**ABSTRACT**  
The exponential growth of social media has profoundly transformed how information is created, disseminated, and absorbed, exceeding any precedent in the digital age. Regrettably, this explosion has also spawned a significant increase in the online abuse of memes. Evaluating the negative impact of memes is notably challenging, owing to their often subtle and implicit meanings, which are not directly conveyed through the overt text and imagery. In light of this, large multimodal models (LMMs) have emerged as a focal point of interest due to their remarkable capabilities in handling diverse multimodal tasks. In response to this development, our paper aims to thoroughly examine the capacity of various LMMs (e.g. GPT-4V) to discern and respond to the nuanced aspects of social abuse manifested in memes. We introduce the comprehensive meme benchmark, GOAT-Bench, comprising over 6K varied memes encapsulating themes such as implicit hate speech, sexism, and cyberbullying, etc. Utilizing GOAT-Bench, we delve into the ability of LMMs to accurately assess hatefulness, misogyny, offensiveness, sarcasm, and harmful content. Our extensive experiments across a range of LMMs reveal that current models still exhibit a deficiency in safety awareness, showing insensitivity to various forms of implicit abuse. We posit that this shortfall represents a critical impediment to the realization of safe artificial intelligence. The GOAT-Bench and accompanying resources are publicly accessible at https://goatlmm.github.io/, contributing to ongoing research in this vital field.

**ABSTRACT**  
In terms of human-computer interaction, it is becoming more and more important to correctly understand the user's emotional state in a conversation, so the task of multimodal emotion recognition (MER) started to receive more attention. However, existing emotion classification methods usually perform classification only once. Sentences are likely to be misclassified in a single round of classification. Previous work usually ignores the similarities and differences between different morphological features in the fusion process. To address the above issues, we propose a two-stage emotion recognition model based on graph contrastive learning (TS-GCL). First, we encode the original dataset with different preprocessing modalities. Second, a graph contrastive learning (GCL) strategy is introduced for these three modal data with other structures to learn similarities and differences within and between modalities. Finally, we use MLP twice to achieve the final emotion classification. This staged classification method can help the model to better focus on different levels of emotional information, thereby improving the performance of the model. Extensive experiments show that TS-GCL has superior performance on IEMOCAP and MELD datasets compared with previous methods.

**ABSTRACT**  
Context: Navigating the knowledge of Stack Overflow (SO) remains challenging. To make the posts vivid to users, SO allows users to write and edit posts with Markdown or HTML so that users can leverage various formatting styles (e.g., bold, italic, and code) to highlight the important information. Nonetheless, there have been limited studies on the highlighted information. Objective: We carried out the first large-scale exploratory study on the information highlighted in SO answers in our recent study. To extend our previous study, we develop approaches to automatically recommend highlighted content with formatting styles using neural network architectures initially designed for the Named Entity Recognition task. Method: In this paper, we studied 31,169,429 answers of Stack Overflow. For training recommendation models, we choose CNN and BERT models for each type of formatting (i.e., Bold, Italic, Code, and Heading) using the information highlighting dataset we collected from SO answers. Results: Our models based on CNN architecture achieve precision ranging from 0.71 to 0.82. The trained model for automatic code content highlighting achieves a recall of 0.73 and an F1 score of 0.71, outperforming the trained models for other formatting styles. The BERT models have even lower recalls and F1 scores than the CNN models. Our analysis of failure cases indicates that the majority of the failure cases are missing identification (i.e., the model misses the content that is supposed to be highlighted) due to the models tend to learn the frequently highlighted words while struggling to learn less frequent words. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that it is possible to develop recommendation models for highlighting information for answers with different formatting styles on Stack Overflow.

**ABSTRACT**  
Summarization of electronic health records (EHRs) can substantially minimize 'screen time' for both patients as well as medical personnel. In recent years summarization of EHRs have employed machine learning pipelines using state of the art neural models. However, these models have produced less than adequate results that are attributed to the difficulty of obtaining sufficient annotated data for training. Moreover, the requirement to consider the entire content of an EHR in summarization has resulted in poor performance due to the fact that attention mechanisms in modern large language models (LLMs) adds a quadratic complexity in terms of the size of the input. We propose here a method that mitigates these shortcomings by combining semantic search, retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and question-answering using the latest LLMs. In our approach summarization is the extraction of answers to specific questions that are deemed important by subject-matter experts (SMEs). Our approach is quite efficient; requires minimal to no training; does not suffer from the 'hallucination' problem of LLMs; and it ensures diversity, since the summary will not have repeated content but diverse answers to specific questions.

**ABSTRACT**  
A critical factor in trustworthy machine learning is to develop robust representations of the training data. Only under this guarantee methods are legitimate to artificially generate data, for example, to counteract imbalanced datasets or provide counterfactual explanations for blackbox decision-making systems. In recent years, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have shown considerable results in forming stable representations and generating realistic data. While many applications focus on generating image data, less effort has been made in generating time series data, especially multivariate signals. In this work, a Transformer-based autoencoder is proposed that is regularized using an adversarial training scheme to generate artificial multivariate time series signals. The representation is evaluated using t-SNE visualizations, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and Entropy scores. Our results indicate that the generated signals exhibit higher similarity to an exemplary dataset than using a convolutional network approach.

**ABSTRACT**  
Motivated by the goals of dataset pruning and defect identification, a growing body of methods have been developed to score individual examples within a dataset. These methods, which we call "example difficulty scores", are typically used to rank or categorize examples, but the consistency of rankings between different training runs, scoring methods, and model architectures is generally unknown. To determine how example rankings vary due to these random and controlled effects, we systematically compare different formulations of scores over a range of runs and model architectures. We find that scores largely share the following traits: they are noisy over individual runs of a model, strongly correlated with a single notion of difficulty, and reveal examples that range from being highly sensitive to insensitive to the inductive biases of certain model architectures. Drawing from statistical genetics, we develop a simple method for fingerprinting model architectures using a few sensitive examples. These findings guide practitioners in maximizing the consistency of their scores (e.g. by choosing appropriate scoring methods, number of runs, and subsets of examples), and establishes comprehensive baselines for evaluating scores in the future.

**ABSTRACT**  
Density estimation, a central problem in machine learning, can be performed using Normalizing Flows (NFs). NFs comprise a sequence of invertible transformations, that turn a complex target distribution into a simple one, by exploiting the change of variables theorem. Neural Autoregressive Flows (NAFs) and Block Neural Autoregressive Flows (B-NAFs) are arguably the most perfomant members of the NF family. However, they suffer scalability issues and training instability due to the constraints imposed on the network structure. In this paper, we propose a novel solution to these challenges by exploiting transformers to define a new class of neural flows called Transformer Neural Autoregressive Flows (T-NAFs). T-NAFs treat each dimension of a random variable as a separate input token, using attention masking to enforce an autoregressive constraint. We take an amortization-inspired approach where the transformer outputs the parameters of an invertible transformation. The experimental results demonstrate that T-NAFs consistently match or outperform NAFs and B-NAFs across multiple datasets from the UCI benchmark. Remarkably, T-NAFs achieve these results using an order of magnitude fewer parameters than previous approaches, without composing multiple flows.

**ABSTRACT**  
Nonnegative tensor factorization (NTF) has become an important tool for feature extraction and part-based representation with preserved intrinsic structure information from nonnegative high-order data. However, the original NTF methods utilize Euclidean or Kullback-Leibler divergence as the loss function which treats each feature equally leading to the neglect of the side-information of features. To utilize correlation information of features and manifold information of samples, we introduce Wasserstein manifold nonnegative tensor factorization (WMNTF), which minimizes the Wasserstein distance between the distribution of input tensorial data and the distribution of reconstruction. Although some researches about Wasserstein distance have been proposed in nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF), they ignore the spatial structure information of higher-order data. We use Wasserstein distance (a.k.a Earth Mover's distance or Optimal Transport distance) as a metric and add a graph regularizer to a latent factor. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared with other NMF and NTF methods.

**ABSTRACT**  
By conceiving physical systems as 3D many-body point clouds, geometric graph neural networks (GNNs), such as SE(3)/E(3) equivalent GNNs, have showcased promising performance. In particular, their effective message-passing mechanics make them adept at modeling molecules and crystalline materials. However, current geometric GNNs only offer a mean-field approximation of the many-body system, encapsulated within two-body message passing, thus falling short in capturing intricate relationships within these geometric graphs. To address this limitation, tensor networks, widely employed by computational physics to handle manybody systems using high-order tensors, have been introduced. Nevertheless, integrating these tensorized networks into the message-passing framework of GNNs faces scalability and symmetry conservation (e.g., permutation and rotation) challenges. In response, we introduce an innovative equivariant Matrix Product State (MPS)-based message-passing strategy, through achieving an efficient implementation of the tensor contraction operation. Our method effectively models complex many-body relationships, suppressing mean-field approximations, and captures symmetries within geometric graphs. Importantly, it seamlessly replaces the standard message-passing and layer-aggregation modules intrinsic to geometric GNNs. We empirically validate the superior accuracy of our approach on benchmark tasks, including predicting classical Newton systems and quantum tensor Hamiltonian matrices. To our knowledge, our approach represents the inaugural utilization of parameterized geometric tensor networks.

**ABSTRACT**  
Explainability in deep networks has gained increased importance in recent years. We argue herein that an AI must be tasked not just with a task but also with an explanation of why said task was accomplished as such. We present a basic framework -- Task and Explanation Network (TENet) -- which fully integrates task completion and its explanation. We believe that the field of AI as a whole should insist -- quite emphatically -- on explainability.

**ABSTRACT**  
Deep learning algorithms are often said to be data hungry. The performance of such algorithms generally improve as more and more annotated data is fed into the model. While collecting unlabelled data is easier (as they can be scraped easily from the internet), annotating them is a tedious and expensive task. Given a fixed budget available for data annotation, Active Learning helps selecting the best subset of data for annotation, such that the deep learning model when trained over that subset will have maximum generalization performance under this budget. In this work, we aim to propose a new Active Learning approach which is model agnostic as well as one doesn't require an iterative process. We aim to leverage self-supervised learnt features for the task of Active Learning. The benefit of self-supervised learning, is that one can get useful feature representation of the input data, without having any annotation.

**ABSTRACT**  
The study of Graph Neural Networks has received considerable interest in the past few years. By extending deep learning to graph-structured data, GNNs can solve a diverse set of tasks in fields including social science, chemistry, and medicine. The development of GNN architectures has largely been focused on improving empirical performance on tasks like node or graph classification. However, a line of recent work has instead sought to find GNN architectures that have desirable theoretical properties - by studying their expressive power and designing architectures that maximize this expressiveness.   While there is no consensus on the best way to define the expressiveness of a GNN, it can be viewed from several well-motivated perspectives. Perhaps the most natural approach is to study the universal approximation properties of GNNs, much in the way that this has been studied extensively for MLPs. Another direction focuses on the extent to which GNNs can distinguish between different graph structures, relating this to the graph isomorphism test. Besides, a GNN's ability to compute graph properties such as graph moments has been suggested as another form of expressiveness. All of these different definitions are complementary and have yielded different recommendations for GNN architecture choices. In this paper, we would like to give an overview of the notion of "expressive power" of GNNs and provide some valuable insights regarding the design choices of GNNs.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper explores the frontiers of large language models (LLMs) in psychology applications. Psychology has undergone several theoretical changes, and the current use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning, particularly LLMs, promises to open up new research directions. We provide a detailed exploration of how LLMs like ChatGPT are transforming psychological research. It discusses the impact of LLMs across various branches of psychology, including cognitive and behavioral, clinical and counseling, educational and developmental, and social and cultural psychology, highlighting their potential to simulate aspects of human cognition and behavior. The paper delves into the capabilities of these models to emulate human-like text generation, offering innovative tools for literature review, hypothesis generation, experimental design, experimental subjects, data analysis, academic writing, and peer review in psychology. While LLMs are essential in advancing research methodologies in psychology, the paper also cautions about their technical and ethical challenges. There are issues like data privacy, the ethical implications of using LLMs in psychological research, and the need for a deeper understanding of these models' limitations. Researchers should responsibly use LLMs in psychological studies, adhering to ethical standards and considering the potential consequences of deploying these technologies in sensitive areas. Overall, the article provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of LLMs in psychology, exploring potential benefits and challenges. It serves as a call to action for researchers to leverage LLMs' advantages responsibly while addressing associated risks.

**ABSTRACT**  
The Kov\'ats Retention index (RI) is a quantity measured using gas chromatography and commonly used in the identification of chemical structures. Creating libraries of observed RI values is a laborious task, so we explore the use of a deep neural network for predicting RI values from structure for standard semipolar columns. This network generated predictions with a mean absolute error of 15.1 and, in a quantification of the tail of the error distribution, a 95th percentile absolute error of 46.5. Because of the Artificial Intelligence Retention Indices (AIRI) network's accuracy, it was used to predict RI values for the NIST EI-MS spectral libraries. These RI values are used to improve chemical identification methods and the quality of the library. Estimating uncertainty is an important practical need when using prediction models. To quantify the uncertainty of our network for each individual prediction, we used the outputs of an ensemble of 8 networks to calculate a predicted standard deviation for each RI value prediction. This predicted standard deviation was corrected to follow the error between observed and predicted RI values. The Z scores using these predicted standard deviations had a standard deviation of 1.52 and a 95th percentile absolute Z score corresponding to a mean RI value of 42.6.

**ABSTRACT**  
In the realm of financial decision-making, predicting stock prices is pivotal. Artificial intelligence techniques such as long short-term memory networks (LSTMs), support-vector machines (SVMs), and natural language processing (NLP) models are commonly employed to predict said prices. This paper utilizes stock percentage change as training data, in contrast to the traditional use of raw currency values, with a focus on analyzing publicly released news articles. The choice of percentage change aims to provide models with context regarding the significance of price fluctuations and overall price change impact on a given stock. The study employs specialized BERT natural language processing models to predict stock price trends, with a particular emphasis on various data modalities. The results showcase the capabilities of such strategies with a small natural language processing model to accurately predict overall stock trends, and highlight the effectiveness of certain data features and sector-specific data.

**ABSTRACT**  
Time series forecasting task predicts future trends based on historical information. Recent U-Net-based methods have demonstrated superior performance in predicting real-world datasets. However, the performance of these models is lower than patch-based models or linear models. In this work, we propose a symmetric and hierarchical framework, Kernel-U-Net, which cuts the input sequence into slices at each layer of the network and then computes them using kernels. Furthermore, it generalizes the concept of convolutional kernels in classic U-Net to accept custom kernels that follow the same design pattern. Compared to the existing linear or transformer-based solution, our model contains 3 advantages: 1) A small number of parameters: the parameters size is $O(log(L)^2)$ where $L$ is the look-back window size, 2) Flexibility: its kernels can be customized and fitted to the datasets, 3) Computation efficiency: the computation complexity of transformer modules is reduced to $O(log(L)^2)$ if they are placed close to the latent vector. Kernel-U-Net accuracy was greater than or equal to the state-of-the-art model on six (out of seven) real-world datasets.

**ABSTRACT**  
In the ever-changing and dynamic realm of high-end fashion marketplaces, providing accurate and personalized size recommendations has become a critical aspect. Meeting customer expectations in this regard is not only crucial for ensuring their satisfaction but also plays a pivotal role in driving customer retention, which is a key metric for the success of any fashion retailer. We propose a novel sequence classification approach to address this problem, integrating implicit (Add2Bag) and explicit (ReturnReason) user signals. Our approach comprises two distinct models: one employs LSTMs to encode the user signals, while the other leverages an Attention mechanism. Our best model outperforms SFNet, improving accuracy by 45.7%. By using Add2Bag interactions we increase the user coverage by 24.5% when compared with only using Orders. Moreover, we evaluate the models' usability in real-time recommendation scenarios by conducting experiments to measure their latency performance.

**ABSTRACT**  
The recent development on large multimodal models (LMMs), especially GPT-4V(ision) and Gemini, has been quickly expanding the capability boundaries of multimodal models beyond traditional tasks like image captioning and visual question answering. In this work, we explore the potential of LMMs like GPT-4V as a generalist web agent that can follow natural language instructions to complete tasks on any given website. We propose SEEACT, a generalist web agent that harnesses the power of LMMs for integrated visual understanding and acting on the web. We evaluate on the recent MIND2WEB benchmark. In addition to standard offline evaluation on cached websites, we enable a new online evaluation setting by developing a tool that allows running web agents on live websites. We show that GPT-4V presents a great potential for web agents - it can successfully complete 50% of the tasks on live websites if we manually ground its textual plans into actions on the websites. This substantially outperforms text-only LLMs like GPT-4 or smaller models (FLAN-T5 and BLIP-2) specifically fine-tuned for web agents. However, grounding still remains a major challenge. Existing LMM grounding strategies like set-of-mark prompting turns out not effective for web agents, and the best grounding strategy we develop in this paper leverages both the HTML text and visuals. Yet, there is still a substantial gap with oracle grounding, leaving ample room for further improvement.

**ABSTRACT**  
We describe team ielab from CSIRO and The University of Queensland's approach to the 2023 TREC Clinical Trials Track. Our approach was to use neural rankers but to utilise Large Language Models to overcome the issue of lack of training data for such rankers. Specifically, we employ ChatGPT to generate relevant patient descriptions for randomly selected clinical trials from the corpus. This synthetic dataset, combined with human-annotated training data from previous years, is used to train both dense and sparse retrievers based on PubmedBERT. Additionally, a cross-encoder re-ranker is integrated into the system. To further enhance the effectiveness of our approach, we prompting GPT-4 as a TREC annotator to provide judgments on our run files. These judgments are subsequently employed to re-rank the results. This architecture tightly integrates strong PubmedBERT-based rankers with the aid of SOTA Large Language Models, demonstrating a new approach to clinical trial retrieval.

**ABSTRACT**  
The advent of Large Language Models has revolutionized information retrieval, ushering in a new era of expansive knowledge accessibility. While these models excel in providing open-world knowledge, effectively extracting answers in diverse linguistic environments with varying levels of literacy remains a formidable challenge. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) emerges as a promising solution, bridging the gap between information availability and multilingual comprehension. However, deploying RAG models in real-world scenarios demands careful consideration of various factors. This paper addresses the critical challenges associated with implementing RAG models in multicultural environments. We delve into essential considerations, including data feeding strategies, timely updates, mitigation of hallucinations, prevention of erroneous responses, and optimization of delivery speed. Our work involves the integration of a diverse array of tools, meticulously combined to facilitate the seamless adoption of RAG models across languages and literacy levels within a multicultural organizational context. Through strategic tweaks in our approaches, we achieve not only effectiveness but also efficiency, ensuring the accelerated and accurate delivery of information in a manner that is tailored to the unique requirements of multilingual and multicultural settings.

**ABSTRACT**  
Sequential recommenders are crucial to the success of online applications, \eg e-commerce, video streaming, and social media. While model architectures continue to improve, for every new application domain, we still have to train a new model from scratch for high quality recommendations. On the other hand, pre-trained language and vision models have shown great success in zero-shot or few-shot adaptation to new application domains. Inspired by the success of pre-trained models in peer AI fields, we propose a novel pre-trained sequential recommendation framework: PrepRec. We learn universal item representations by modeling item popularity dynamics. Through extensive experiments on five real-world datasets, we show that PrepRec, without any auxiliary information, can not only zero-shot transfer to a new domain, but achieve competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art sequential recommender models with only a fraction of the model size. In addition, with a simple post-hoc interpolation, PrepRec can improve the performance of existing sequential recommenders on average by 13.8\% in Recall@10 and 29.5% in NDCG@10. We provide an anonymized implementation of PrepRec at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/PrepRec--2F60/

**ABSTRACT**  
AI-driven models are increasingly deployed in operational analytics solutions, for instance, in investigative journalism or the intelligence community. Current approaches face two primary challenges: ethical and privacy concerns, as well as difficulties in efficiently combining heterogeneous data sources for multimodal analytics. To tackle the challenge of multimodal analytics, we present MULTI-CASE, a holistic visual analytics framework tailored towards ethics-aware and multimodal intelligence exploration, designed in collaboration with domain experts. It leverages an equal joint agency between human and AI to explore and assess heterogeneous information spaces, checking and balancing automation through Visual Analytics. MULTI-CASE operates on a fully-integrated data model and features type-specific analysis with multiple linked components, including a combined search, annotated text view, and graph-based analysis. Parts of the underlying entity detection are based on a RoBERTa-based language model, which we tailored towards user requirements through fine-tuning. An overarching knowledge exploration graph combines all information streams, provides in-situ explanations, transparent source attribution, and facilitates effective exploration. To assess our approach, we conducted a comprehensive set of evaluations: We benchmarked the underlying language model on relevant NER tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance. The demonstrator was assessed according to intelligence capability assessments, while the methodology was evaluated according to ethics design guidelines. As a case study, we present our framework in an investigative journalism setting, supporting war crime investigations. Finally, we conduct a formative user evaluation with domain experts in law enforcement. Our evaluations confirm that our framework facilitates human agency and steering in security-sensitive applications.

**ABSTRACT**  
Surfactants are of high importance in different industrial sectors such as cosmetics, detergents, oil recovery and drug delivery systems. Therefore, many quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) models have been developed for surfactants. Each predictive model typically focuses on one surfactant class, mostly nonionics. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have exhibited a great predictive performance for property prediction of ionic liquids, polymers and drugs in general. Specifically for surfactants, GNNs can successfully predict critical micelle concentration (CMC), a key surfactant property associated with micellization. A key factor in the predictive ability of QSPR and GNN models is the data available for training. Based on extensive literature search, we create the largest available CMC database with 429 molecules and the first large data collection for surface excess concentration ($\Gamma$$_{m}$), another surfactant property associated with foaming, with 164 molecules. Then, we develop GNN models to predict the CMC and $\Gamma$$_{m}$ and we explore different learning approaches, i.e., single- and multi-task learning, as well as different training strategies, namely ensemble and transfer learning. We find that a multi-task GNN with ensemble learning trained on all $\Gamma$$_{m}$ and CMC data performs best. Finally, we test the ability of our CMC model to generalize on industrial grade pure component surfactants. The GNN yields highly accurate predictions for CMC, showing great potential for future industrial applications.

**ABSTRACT**  
Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) have become a transformative technology that can change our daily life. Currently, millimeter-wave (mmWave) bands are identified as the promising CAV connectivity solution. While it can provide high data rate, their realization faces many challenges such as high attenuation during mmWave signal propagation and mobility management. Existing solution has to initiate pilot signal to measure channel information, then apply signal processing to calculate the best narrow beam towards the receiver end to guarantee sufficient signal power. This process takes significant overhead and time, hence not suitable for vehicles. In this study, we propose an autonomous and low-cost testbed to collect extensive co-located mmWave signal and other sensors data such as LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging), cameras, ultrasonic, etc, traditionally for ``automated'', to facilitate mmWave vehicular communications. Intuitively, these sensors can build a 3D map around the vehicle and signal propagation path can be estimated, eliminating iterative the process via pilot signals. This multimodal data fusion, together with AI, is expected to bring significant advances in ``connected'' research.

**ABSTRACT**  
Advances in model editing through neuron pruning hold promise for removing undesirable concepts from large language models. However, it remains unclear whether models have the capacity to reacquire pruned concepts after editing. To investigate this, we evaluate concept relearning in models by tracking concept saliency and similarity in pruned neurons during retraining. Our findings reveal that models can quickly regain performance post-pruning by relocating advanced concepts to earlier layers and reallocating pruned concepts to primed neurons with similar semantics. This demonstrates that models exhibit polysemantic capacities and can blend old and new concepts in individual neurons. While neuron pruning provides interpretability into model concepts, our results highlight the challenges of permanent concept removal for improved model \textit{safety}. Monitoring concept reemergence and developing techniques to mitigate relearning of unsafe concepts will be important directions for more robust model editing. Overall, our work strongly demonstrates the resilience and fluidity of concept representations in LLMs post concept removal.

**ABSTRACT**  
Creativity serves as a cornerstone for societal progress and innovation, but its assessment remains a complex and often subjective endeavor. With the rise of advanced generative AI models capable of tasks once reserved for human creativity, the study of AI's creative potential becomes imperative for its responsible development and application. This paper addresses the complexities in defining and evaluating creativity by introducing a new concept called Relative Creativity. Instead of trying to define creativity universally, we shift the focus to whether AI can match the creative abilities of a hypothetical human. This perspective draws inspiration from the Turing Test, expanding upon it to address the challenges and subjectivities inherent in evaluating creativity. This methodological shift facilitates a statistically quantifiable evaluation of AI's creativity, which we term Statistical Creativity. This approach allows for direct comparisons of AI's creative abilities with those of specific human groups. Building on this foundation, we discuss the application of statistical creativity in contemporary prompt-conditioned autoregressive models. In addition to defining and analyzing a measure of creativity, we introduce an actionable training guideline, effectively bridging the gap between theoretical quantification of creativity and practical model training. Through these multifaceted contributions, the paper establishes a cohesive, continuously evolving, and transformative framework for assessing and fostering statistical creativity in AI models.

**ABSTRACT**  
We investigate whether general-domain large language models such as GPT-4 Turbo can perform risk stratification and predict post-operative outcome measures using a description of the procedure and a patient's clinical notes derived from the electronic health record. We examine predictive performance on 8 different tasks: prediction of ASA Physical Status Classification, hospital admission, ICU admission, unplanned admission, hospital mortality, PACU Phase 1 duration, hospital duration, and ICU duration. Few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting improves predictive performance for several of the tasks. We achieve F1 scores of 0.50 for ASA Physical Status Classification, 0.81 for ICU admission, and 0.86 for hospital mortality. Performance on duration prediction tasks were universally poor across all prompt strategies. Current generation large language models can assist clinicians in perioperative risk stratification on classification tasks and produce high-quality natural language summaries and explanations.

**ABSTRACT**  
In the healthcare domain, summarizing medical questions posed by patients is critical for improving doctor-patient interactions and medical decision-making. Although medical data has grown in complexity and quantity, the current body of research in this domain has primarily concentrated on text-based methods, overlooking the integration of visual cues. Also prior works in the area of medical question summarisation have been limited to the English language. This work introduces the task of multimodal medical question summarization for codemixed input in a low-resource setting. To address this gap, we introduce the Multimodal Medical Codemixed Question Summarization MMCQS dataset, which combines Hindi-English codemixed medical queries with visual aids. This integration enriches the representation of a patient's medical condition, providing a more comprehensive perspective. We also propose a framework named MedSumm that leverages the power of LLMs and VLMs for this task. By utilizing our MMCQS dataset, we demonstrate the value of integrating visual information from images to improve the creation of medically detailed summaries. This multimodal strategy not only improves healthcare decision-making but also promotes a deeper comprehension of patient queries, paving the way for future exploration in personalized and responsive medical care. Our dataset, code, and pre-trained models will be made publicly available.

**ABSTRACT**  
This research explores the reliability of deep learning, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, for estimating the Hurst parameter in fractional stochastic processes. The study focuses on three types of processes: fractional Brownian motion (fBm), fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (fOU) process, and linear fractional stable motions (lfsm). The work involves a fast generation of extensive datasets for fBm and fOU to train the LSTM network on a large volume of data in a feasible time. The study analyses the accuracy of the LSTM network's Hurst parameter estimation regarding various performance measures like RMSE, MAE, MRE, and quantiles of the absolute and relative errors. It finds that LSTM outperforms the traditional statistical methods in the case of fBm and fOU processes; however, it has limited accuracy on lfsm processes. The research also delves into the implications of training length and valuation sequence length on the LSTM's performance. The methodology is applied by estimating the Hurst parameter in Li-ion battery degradation data and obtaining confidence bounds for the estimation. The study concludes that while deep learning methods show promise in parameter estimation of fractional processes, their effectiveness is contingent on the process type and the quality of training data.

**ABSTRACT**  
We introduce a new challenge to the software development community: 1) leveraging AI to accurately detect and flag up secrets in code and on popular document sharing platforms that frequently used by developers, such as Confluence and 2) automatically remediating the detections (e.g. by suggesting password vault functionality). This is a challenging, and mostly unaddressed task. Existing methods leverage heuristics and regular expressions, that can be very noisy, and therefore increase toil on developers. The next step - modifying code itself - to automatically remediate a detection, is a complex task. We introduce two baseline AI models that have good detection performance and propose an automatic mechanism for remediating secrets found in code, opening up the study of this task to the wider community.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper discusses the limitations of evaluating Masked Language Models (MLMs) in code completion tasks. We highlight that relying on accuracy-based measurements may lead to an overestimation of models' capabilities by neglecting the syntax rules of programming languages. To address these issues, we introduce a technique called SyntaxEval in which Syntactic Capabilities are used to enhance the evaluation of MLMs. SyntaxEval automates the process of masking elements in the model input based on their Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs). We conducted a case study on two popular MLMs using data from GitHub repositories. Our results showed negative causal effects between the node types and MLMs' accuracy. We conclude that MLMs under study fail to predict some syntactic capabilities.

**ABSTRACT**  
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is now a cornerstone of requirements automation. One compelling factor behind the growing adoption of NLP in Requirements Engineering (RE) is the prevalent use of natural language (NL) for specifying requirements in industry. NLP techniques are commonly used for automatically classifying requirements, extracting important information, e.g., domain models and glossary terms, and performing quality assurance tasks, such as ambiguity handling and completeness checking. With so many different NLP solution strategies available and the possibility of applying machine learning alongside, it can be challenging to choose the right strategy for a specific RE task and to evaluate the resulting solution in an empirically rigorous manner. This book chapter presents guidelines for the selection of NLP techniques as well as for their evaluation in the context of RE. In particular, we discuss how to choose among different strategies such as traditional NLP, feature-based machine learning, and language-model-based methods. Our ultimate hope for this chapter is to serve as a stepping stone, assisting newcomers to NLP4RE in quickly initiating themselves into the NLP technologies most pertinent to the RE field.

**ABSTRACT**  
Global financial crime activity is driving demand for machine learning solutions in fraud prevention. However, prevention systems are commonly serviced to financial institutions in isolation, and few provisions exist for data sharing due to fears of unintentional leaks and adversarial attacks. Collaborative learning advances in finance are rare, and it is hard to find real-world insights derived from privacy-preserving data processing systems. In this paper, we present a collaborative deep learning framework for fraud prevention, designed from a privacy standpoint, and awarded at the recent PETs Prize Challenges. We leverage latent embedded representations of varied-length transaction sequences, along with local differential privacy, in order to construct a data release mechanism which can securely inform externally hosted fraud and anomaly detection models. We assess our contribution on two distributed data sets donated by large payment networks, and demonstrate robustness to popular inference-time attacks, along with utility-privacy trade-offs analogous to published work in alternative application domains.

**ABSTRACT**  
Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is a new computing paradigm that enables cloud computing and information technology (IT) services to be delivered at the network's edge. By shifting the load of cloud computing to individual local servers, MEC helps meet the requirements of ultralow latency, localized data processing, and extends the potential of Internet of Things (IoT) for end-users. However, the crosscutting nature of MEC and the multidisciplinary components necessary for its deployment have presented additional security and privacy concerns. Fortunately, Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms can cope with excessively unpredictable and complex data, which offers a distinct advantage in dealing with sophisticated and developing adversaries in the security industry. Hence, in this paper we comprehensively provide a survey of security and privacy in MEC from the perspective of AI. On the one hand, we use European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) MEC reference architecture as our based framework while merging the Software Defined Network (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) to better illustrate a serviceable platform of MEC. On the other hand, we focus on new security and privacy issues, as well as potential solutions from the viewpoints of AI. Finally, we comprehensively discuss the opportunities and challenges associated with applying AI to MEC security and privacy as possible future research directions.

**ABSTRACT**  
The area of Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) is experiencing increased implementation due to recent advancements in the AI (Artificial Intelligence) industry. However, this spike has prompted concerns regarding AI defense mechanisms, specifically regarding potential covert attacks from third-party providers that cannot be entirely trusted. Recent research has uncovered that auditory backdoors may use certain modifications as their initiating mechanism. DynamicTrigger is introduced as a methodology for carrying out dynamic backdoor attacks that use cleverly designed tweaks to ensure that corrupted samples are indistinguishable from clean. By utilizing fluctuating signal sampling rates and masking speaker identities through dynamic sound triggers (such as the clapping of hands), it is possible to deceive speech recognition systems (ASR). Our empirical testing demonstrates that DynamicTrigger is both potent and stealthy, achieving impressive success rates during covert attacks while maintaining exceptional accuracy with non-poisoned datasets.

**ABSTRACT**  
Large language models (LLMs) have been extensively used as the backbones for general-purpose agents, and some economics literature suggest that LLMs are capable of playing various types of economics games. Following these works, to overcome the limitation of evaluating LLMs using static benchmarks, we propose to explore competitive games as an evaluation for LLMs to incorporate multi-players and dynamicise the environment. By varying the game history revealed to LLMs-based players, we find that most of LLMs are rational in that they play strategies that can increase their payoffs, but not as rational as indicated by Nash Equilibria (NEs). Moreover, when game history are available, certain types of LLMs, such as GPT-4, can converge faster to the NE strategies, which suggests higher rationality level in comparison to other models. In the meantime, certain types of LLMs can win more often when game history are available, and we argue that the winning rate reflects the reasoning ability with respect to the strategies of other players. Throughout all our experiments, we observe that the ability to strictly follow the game rules described by natural languages also vary among the LLMs we tested. In this work, we provide an economics arena for the LLMs research community as a dynamic simulation to test the above-mentioned abilities of LLMs, i.e. rationality, strategic reasoning ability, and instruction-following capability.

**ABSTRACT**  
Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) offers various services to users through content creation, which is believed to be one of the most important components in future networks. However, training and deploying big artificial intelligence models (BAIMs) introduces substantial computational and communication overhead.This poses a critical challenge to centralized approaches, due to the need of high-performance computing infrastructure and the reliability, secrecy and timeliness issues in long-distance access of cloud services. Therefore, there is an urging need to decentralize the services, partly moving them from the cloud to the edge and establishing native GenAI services to enable private, timely, and personalized experiences. In this paper, we propose a brand-new bottom-up BAIM architecture with synergetic big cloud model and small edge models, and design a distributed training framework and a task-oriented deployment scheme for efficient provision of native GenAI services. The proposed framework can facilitate collaborative intelligence, enhance adaptability, gather edge knowledge and alleviate edge-cloud burden. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through an image generation use case. Finally, we outline fundamental research directions to fully exploit the collaborative potential of edge and cloud for native GenAI and BAIM applications.

**ABSTRACT**  
Data privacy and protection through anonymization is a critical issue for network operators or data owners before it is forwarded for other possible use of data. With the adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI), data anonymization augments the likelihood of covering up necessary sensitive information; preventing data leakage and information loss. OpenWiFi networks are vulnerable to any adversary who is trying to gain access or knowledge on traffic regardless of the knowledge possessed by data owners. The odds for discovery of actual traffic information is addressed by applied conditional tabular generative adversarial network (CTGAN). CTGAN yields synthetic data; which disguises as actual data but fostering hidden acute information of actual data. In this paper, the similarity assessment of synthetic with actual data is showcased in terms of clustering algorithms followed by a comparison of performance for unsupervised cluster validation metrics. A well-known algorithm, K-means outperforms other algorithms in terms of similarity assessment of synthetic data over real data while achieving nearest scores 0.634, 23714.57, and 0.598 as Silhouette, Calinski and Harabasz and Davies Bouldin metric respectively. On exploiting a comparative analysis in validation scores among several algorithms, K-means forms the epitome of unsupervised clustering algorithms ensuring explicit usage of synthetic data at the same time a replacement for real data. Hence, the experimental results aim to show the viability of using CTGAN-generated synthetic data in lieu of publishing anonymized data to be utilized in various applications.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recent research has shown the potential of deep learning in multi-parametric MRI-based visual pathway (VP) segmentation. However, obtaining labeled data for training is laborious and time-consuming. Therefore, it is crucial to develop effective algorithms in situations with limited labeled samples. In this work, we propose a label-efficient deep learning method with self-ensembling (LESEN). LESEN incorporates supervised and unsupervised losses, enabling the student and teacher models to mutually learn from each other, forming a self-ensembling mean teacher framework. Additionally, we introduce a reliable unlabeled sample selection (RUSS) mechanism to further enhance LESEN's effectiveness. Our experiments on the human connectome project (HCP) dataset demonstrate the superior performance of our method when compared to state-of-the-art techniques, advancing multimodal VP segmentation for comprehensive analysis in clinical and research settings. The implementation code will be available at: https://github.com/aldiak/Semi-Supervised-Multimodal-Visual-Pathway- Delineation.

**ABSTRACT**  
Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy, and accurately distinguishing between benign and malignant thyroid tumors is crucial for developing effective treatment plans in clinical practice. Pathologically, thyroid tumors pose diagnostic challenges due to improper specimen sampling. In this study, we have designed a three-stage model using representation learning to integrate pixel-level and slice-level annotations for distinguishing thyroid tumors. This structure includes a pathology structure recognition method to predict structures related to thyroid tumors, an encoder-decoder network to extract pixel-level annotation information by learning the feature representations of image blocks, and an attention-based learning mechanism for the final classification task. This mechanism learns the importance of different image blocks in a pathological region, globally considering the information from each block. In the third stage, all information from the image blocks in a region is aggregated using attention mechanisms, followed by classification to determine the category of the region. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method can predict microscopic structures more accurately. After color-coding, the method achieves results on unstained pathology slides that approximate the quality of Hematoxylin and eosin staining, reducing the need for stained pathology slides. Furthermore, by leveraging the concept of indirect measurement and extracting polarized features from structures correlated with lesions, the proposed method can also classify samples where membrane structures cannot be obtained through sampling, providing a potential objective and highly accurate indirect diagnostic technique for thyroid tumors.

**ABSTRACT**  
During the last decade, wireless data services have had an incredible impact on people's lives in ways we could never have imagined. The number of mobile devices has increased exponentially and data traffic has almost doubled every year. Undoubtedly, the rate of growth will continue to be rapid with the explosive increase in demands for data rates, latency, massive connectivity, network reliability, and energy efficiency. In order to manage this level of growth and meet these requirements, the fifth-generation (5G) mobile communications network is envisioned as a revolutionary advancement combining various improvements to previous mobile generation networks and new technologies, including the use of millimeter wavebands (mm-wave), massive multiple-input multipleoutput (mMIMO) multi-beam antennas, network densification, dynamic Time Division Duplex (TDD) transmission, and new waveforms with mixed numerologies. New revolutionary features including terahertz (THz) communications and the integration of Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN) can further improve the performance and signal quality for future 6G networks. However, despite the inevitable benefits of all these key technologies, the heterogeneous and ultra-flexible structure of the 5G and beyond network brings non-orthogonality into the system and generates significant interference that needs to be handled carefully. Therefore, it is essential to design effective interference management schemes to mitigate severe and sometimes unpredictable interference in mobile networks. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of interference management in 5G and Beyond networks and discuss its future evolution. We start with a unified classification and a detailed explanation of the different types of interference and continue by presenting our taxonomy of existing interference management approaches. Then, after explaining interference measurement reports and signaling, we provide for each type of interference identified, an in-depth literature review and technical discussion of appropriate management schemes. We finish by discussing the main interference challenges that will be encountered in future 6G networks and by presenting insights on the suggested new interference management approaches, including useful guidelines for an AI-based solution. This review will provide a first-hand guide to the industry in determining the most relevant technology for interference management, and will also allow for consideration of future challenges and research directions.

**ABSTRACT**  
We explore the potential of enhancing LLM performance in astronomy-focused question-answering through targeted, continual pre-training. By employing a compact 7B-parameter LLaMA-2 model and focusing exclusively on a curated set of astronomy corpora -- comprising abstracts, introductions, and conclusions -- we achieve notable improvements in specialized topic comprehension. While general LLMs like GPT-4 excel in broader question-answering scenarios due to superior reasoning capabilities, our findings suggest that continual pre-training with limited resources can still enhance model performance on specialized topics. Additionally, we present an extension of AstroLLaMA: the fine-tuning of the 7B LLaMA model on a domain-specific conversational dataset, culminating in the release of the chat-enabled AstroLLaMA for community use. Comprehensive quantitative benchmarking is currently in progress and will be detailed in an upcoming full paper. The model, AstroLLaMA-Chat, is now available at https://huggingface.co/universeTBD, providing the first open-source conversational AI tool tailored for the astronomy community.

**ABSTRACT**  
This study was groundbreaking in its application of neural network models for nitrate management in the Recirculating Aquaculture System (RAS). A hybrid neural network model was proposed, which accurately predicted daily nitrate concentration and its trends using six water quality parameters. We conducted a 105-day aquaculture experiment, during which we collected 450 samples from five sets of RAS to train our model (C-L-A model) which incorporates Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and self-Attention. Furthermore, we obtained 90 samples from a standalone RAS as the testing data to evaluate the performance of the model in practical applications. The experimental results proved that the C-L-A model accurately predicted nitrate concentration in RAS and maintained good performance even with a reduced proportion of training data. We recommend using water quality parameters from the past 7 days to forecast future nitrate concentration, as this timeframe allows the model to achieve maximum generalization capability. Additionally, we compared the performance of the C-L-A model with three basic neural network models (CNN, LSTM, self-Attention) as well as three hybrid neural network models (CNN-LSTM, CNN-Attention, LSTM-Attention). The results demonstrated that the C-L-A model (R2=0.956) significantly outperformed the other neural network models (R2=0.901-0.927). Our study suggests that the utilization of neural network models, specifically the C-L-A model, could potentially assist the RAS industry in conserving resources for daily nitrate monitoring.

**ABSTRACT**  
Speaker representation learning is critical for modern voice recognition systems. While supervised learning techniques require extensive labeled data, unsupervised methodologies can leverage vast unlabeled corpora, offering a scalable solution. This paper introduces self-supervised reflective learning (SSRL), a novel paradigm that streamlines existing iterative unsupervised frameworks. SSRL integrates self-supervised knowledge distillation with online clustering to refine pseudo labels and train the model without iterative bottlenecks. Specifically, a teacher model continually refines pseudo labels through online clustering, providing dynamic supervision signals to train the student model. The student model undergoes noisy student training with input and model noise to boost its modeling capacity. The teacher model is updated via an exponential moving average of the student, acting as an ensemble of past iterations. Further, a pseudo label queue retains historical labels for consistency, and noisy label modeling directs learning towards clean samples. Experiments on VoxCeleb show SSRL's superiority over current iterative approaches, surpassing the performance of a 5-round method in just a single training round. Ablation studies validate the contributions of key components like noisy label modeling and pseudo label queues. Moreover, consistent improvements in pseudo labeling and the convergence of cluster counts demonstrate SSRL's effectiveness in deciphering unlabeled data. This work marks an important advancement in efficient and accurate speaker representation learning through the novel reflective learning paradigm.
