**ABSTRACT**  
This paper addresses influence pathway discovery, a key emerging problem in today's online media. We propose a discovery algorithm that leverages recently published work on unsupervised interpretable ideological embedding, a mapping of ideological beliefs (done in a self-supervised fashion) into interpretable low-dimensional spaces. Computing the ideological embedding at scale allows one to analyze correlations between the ideological positions of leaders, influencers, news portals, or population segments, deriving potential influence pathways. The work is motivated by the importance of social media as the preeminent means for global interactions and collaborations on today's Internet, as well as their frequent (mis-)use to wield influence that targets social beliefs and attitudes of selected populations. Tools that enable the understanding and mapping of influence propagation through population segments on social media are therefore increasingly important. In this paper, influence is measured by the perceived ideological shift over time that is correlated with influencers' activity. Correlated shifts in ideological embeddings indicate changes, such as swings/switching (among competing ideologies), polarization (depletion of neutral ideological positions), escalation/radicalization (shifts to more extreme versions of the ideology), or unification/cooldown (shifts towards more neutral stances). Case-studies are presented to explore selected influence pathways (i) in a recent French election, (ii) during political discussions in the Philippines, and (iii) for some Russian messaging during the Russia/Ukraine conflict.

**ABSTRACT**  
Humanity for centuries has perfected skills of interpersonal interactions and evolved patterns that enable people to detect lies and deceiving behavior of others in face-to-face settings. Unprecedented growth of people's access to mobile phones and social media raises an important question: How does this new technology influence people's interactions and support the use of traditional patterns? In this paper, we answer this question for homophily driven patterns in social media. In our previous studies, we found that, on a university campus, changes in student opinions were driven by the desire to hold popular opinions. Here, we demonstrate that the evolution of online platform-wide opinion groups is driven by the same desire. We focus on two social media: Twitter and Parler, on which we tracked the political biases of their users. On Parler, an initially stable group of right-biased users evolved into a permanent right-leaning echo chamber dominating weaker, transient groups of members with opposing political biases. In contrast, on Twitter, the initial presence of two large opposing bias groups led to the evolution of a bimodal bias distribution, with a high degree of polarization. We capture the movement of users from the initial to final bias groups during the tracking period. We also show that user choices are influenced by side-effects of homophily. The users entering the platform attempt to find a sufficiently large group whose members hold political bias within the range sufficiently close to the new user's bias. If successful, they stabilize their bias and become a permanent member of the group. Otherwise, they leave the platform. We believe that the dynamics of users uncovered in this paper create a foundation for technical solutions supporting social groups on social media and socially aware networks.

**ABSTRACT**  
Link weight prediction is of great practical importance, since real-world networks are often weighted networks. Previous studies have mainly used shallow graph features for link weight prediction, which limits the prediction performance. In this paper, we propose a new link weight prediction algorithm, namely Line Graph Neural Networks for Link Weight Prediction (LGLWP), which learns deeper graph features through deep learning. In our algorithm, we first extract the enclosing subgraph around a target link, and then employ a weighted graph labeling algorithm to label the subgraph nodes. Next, we transform the subgraph into a line graph and apply the graph convolution neural networks to learn the node embedding in the line graph, which can represent the links in the original subgraph. Finally, the link feature vectors are put into a fully-connected neural network to predict the weight of the target link. Our algorithm directly obtain the feature vectors of the target links in the original graph, which is better than the previous methods that splice the node feature vectors for link weight prediction. Experiments results on six real datasets of various network sizes and types show that our algorithm has better prediction performance than the state-of-art methods, while it has fewer parameters and high training efficiency.

**ABSTRACT**  
This work reports the empirical performance of an automated medical landmark detection method for predict clinical markers in hip radiograph images. Notably, the detection method was trained using a label-only augmentation scheme; our results indicate that this form of augmentation outperforms traditional data augmentation and produces highly sample efficient estimators. We train a generic U-Net-based architecture under a curriculum consisting of two phases: initially relaxing the landmarking task by enlarging the label points to regions, then gradually eroding these label regions back to the base task. We measure the benefits of this approach on six datasets of radiographs with gold-standard expert annotations.

Clinical data, including demographics, comorbidities, lab results, and imaging, were collected and used to construct predictive models. These models, leveraging various machine learning algorithms, demonstrated commendable performance in identifying patients at risk. Early detection through these models promises timely interventions and improved outcomes. In conclusion, this research underscores the potential of data-driven machine learning for predicting post-COVID-19 cardiovascular complications, emphasizing the need for continued validation and research in diverse clinical settings.

**ABSTRACT**  
We present Any-Modality Augmented Language Model (AnyMAL), a unified model that reasons over diverse input modality signals (i.e. text, image, video, audio, IMU motion sensor), and generates textual responses. AnyMAL inherits the powerful text-based reasoning abilities of the state-of-the-art LLMs including LLaMA-2 (70B), and converts modality-specific signals to the joint textual space through a pre-trained aligner module. To further strengthen the multimodal LLM's capabilities, we fine-tune the model with a multimodal instruction set manually collected to cover diverse topics and tasks beyond simple QAs. We conduct comprehensive empirical analysis comprising both human and automatic evaluations, and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on various multimodal tasks.

**ABSTRACT**  
Mechanistic interpretability seeks to understand the internal mechanisms of machine learning models, where localization -- identifying the important model components -- is a key step. Activation patching, also known as causal tracing or interchange intervention, is a standard technique for this task (Vig et al., 2020), but the literature contains many variants with little consensus on the choice of hyperparameters or methodology. In this work, we systematically examine the impact of methodological details in activation patching, including evaluation metrics and corruption methods. In several settings of localization and circuit discovery in language models, we find that varying these hyperparameters could lead to disparate interpretability results. Backed by empirical observations, we give conceptual arguments for why certain metrics or methods may be preferred. Finally, we provide recommendations for the best practices of activation patching going forwards.

**ABSTRACT**  
With the ever-growing popularity of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), efficient GNN inference is gaining tremendous attention. Field-Programming Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are a promising execution platform due to their fine-grained parallelism, low-power consumption, reconfigurability, and concurrent execution. Even better, High-Level Synthesis (HLS) tools bridge the gap between the non-trivial FPGA development efforts and rapid emergence of new GNN models. In this paper, we propose GNNHLS, an open-source framework to comprehensively evaluate GNN inference acceleration on FPGAs via HLS, containing a software stack for data generation and baseline deployment, and FPGA implementations of 6 well-tuned GNN HLS kernels. We evaluate GNNHLS on 4 graph datasets with distinct topologies and scales. The results show that GNNHLS achieves up to 50.8x speedup and 423x energy reduction relative to the CPU baselines. Compared with the GPU baselines, GNNHLS achieves up to 5.16x speedup and 74.5x energy reduction.

**ABSTRACT**  
Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs) have recently emerged as a novel and powerful technique for self-supervised representation learning. They aim to learn an energy-based model by predicting the latent representation of a target signal $y$ from a context signal $x$. JEPAs bypass the need for data augmentation and negative samples, which are typically required by contrastive learning, while avoiding the overfitting issues associated with generative-based pretraining. In this paper, we show that graph-level representations can be effectively modeled using this paradigm and propose Graph-JEPA, the first JEPA for the graph domain. In particular, we employ masked modeling to learn embeddings for different subgraphs of the input graph. To endow the representations with the implicit hierarchy that is often present in graph-level concepts, we devise an alternative training objective that consists of predicting the coordinates of the encoded subgraphs on the unit hyperbola in the 2D plane. Extensive validation shows that Graph-JEPA can learn representations that are expressive and competitive in both graph classification and regression problems.

**ABSTRACT**  
Anomaly detection is critical to ensure the security of cyber-physical systems (CPS). However, due to the increasing complexity of attacks and CPS themselves, anomaly detection in CPS is becoming more and more challenging. In our previous work, we proposed a digital twin-based anomaly detection method, called ATTAIN, which takes advantage of both historical and real-time data of CPS. However, such data vary significantly in terms of difficulty. Therefore, similar to human learning processes, deep learning models (e.g., ATTAIN) can benefit from an easy-to-difficult curriculum. To this end, in this paper, we present a novel approach, named digitaL twin-based Anomaly deTecTion wIth Curriculum lEarning (LATTICE), which extends ATTAIN by introducing curriculum learning to optimize its learning paradigm. LATTICE attributes each sample with a difficulty score, before being fed into a training scheduler. The training scheduler samples batches of training data based on these difficulty scores such that learning from easy to difficult data can be performed. To evaluate LATTICE, we use five publicly available datasets collected from five real-world CPS testbeds. We compare LATTICE with ATTAIN and two other state-of-the-art anomaly detectors. Evaluation results show that LATTICE outperforms the three baselines and ATTAIN by 0.906%-2.367% in terms of the F1 score. LATTICE also, on average, reduces the training time of ATTAIN by 4.2% on the five datasets and is on par with the baselines in terms of detection delay time.

**ABSTRACT**  
This study explored the potential of gait analysis as a tool for assessing post-injury complications, e.g., infection, malunion, or hardware irritation, in patients with lower extremity fractures. The research focused on the proficiency of supervised machine learning models predicting complications using consecutive gait datasets. We identified patients with lower extremity fractures at an academic center. Patients underwent gait analysis with a chest-mounted IMU device. Using software, raw gait data was preprocessed, emphasizing 12 essential gait variables. Machine learning models including XGBoost, Logistic Regression, SVM, LightGBM, and Random Forest were trained, tested, and evaluated. Attention was given to class imbalance, addressed using SMOTE. We introduced a methodology to compute the Rate of Change (ROC) for gait variables, independent of the time difference between gait analyses. XGBoost was the optimal model both before and after applying SMOTE. Prior to SMOTE, the model achieved an average test AUC of 0.90 (95% CI: [0.79, 1.00]) and test accuracy of 86% (95% CI: [75%, 97%]). Feature importance analysis attributed importance to the duration between injury and gait analysis. Data patterns showed early physiological compensations, followed by stabilization phases, emphasizing prompt gait analysis. This study underscores the potential of machine learning, particularly XGBoost, in gait analysis for orthopedic care. Predicting post-injury complications, early gait assessment becomes vital, revealing intervention points. The findings support a shift in orthopedics towards a data-informed approach, enhancing patient outcomes.

**ABSTRACT**  
Machine Learning (ML) is currently being exploited in numerous applications being one of the most effective Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies, used in diverse fields, such as vision, autonomous systems, and alike. The trend motivated a significant amount of contributions to the analysis and design of ML applications against faults affecting the underlying hardware. The authors investigate the existing body of knowledge on Deep Learning (among ML techniques) resilience against hardware faults systematically through a thoughtful review in which the strengths and weaknesses of this literature stream are presented clearly and then future avenues of research are set out. The review is based on 163 scientific articles published between January 2019 and March 2023. The authors adopt a classifying framework to interpret and highlight research similarities and peculiarities, based on several parameters, starting from the main scope of the work, the adopted fault and error models, to their reproducibility. This framework allows for a comparison of the different solutions and the identification of possible synergies. Furthermore, suggestions concerning the future direction of research are proposed in the form of open challenges to be addressed.

**ABSTRACT**  
In order to support the advancement of machine learning methods for predicting time-series data, we present a comprehensive dataset designed explicitly for long-term time-series forecasting. We incorporate a collection of datasets obtained from diverse, dynamic systems and real-life records. Each dataset is standardized by dividing it into training and test trajectories with predetermined lookback lengths. We include trajectories of length up to $2000$ to ensure a reliable evaluation of long-term forecasting capabilities. To determine the most effective model in diverse scenarios, we conduct an extensive benchmarking analysis using classical and state-of-the-art models, namely LSTM, DeepAR, NLinear, N-Hits, PatchTST, and LatentODE. Our findings reveal intriguing performance comparisons among these models, highlighting the dataset-dependent nature of model effectiveness. Notably, we introduce a custom latent NLinear model and enhance DeepAR with a curriculum learning phase. Both consistently outperform their vanilla counterparts.

**ABSTRACT**  
In the domain of semi-supervised learning, the current approaches insufficiently exploit the potential of considering inter-instance relationships among (un)labeled data. In this work, we address this limitation by providing an approach for inferring latent graphs that capture the intrinsic data relationships. By leveraging graph-based representations, our approach facilitates the seamless propagation of information throughout the graph, enabling the effective incorporation of global and local knowledge. Through evaluations on biomedical tabular datasets, we compare the capabilities of our approach to other contemporary methods. Our work demonstrates the significance of inter-instance relationship discovery as practical means for constructing robust latent graphs to enhance semi-supervised learning techniques. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on three biomedical datasets.

**ABSTRACT**  
We present a new algorithm based on posterior sampling for learning in constrained Markov decision processes (CMDP) in the infinite-horizon undiscounted setting. The algorithm achieves near-optimal regret bounds while being advantageous empirically compared to the existing algorithms. Our main theoretical result is a Bayesian regret bound for each cost component of \tilde{O} (HS \sqrt{AT}) for any communicating CMDP with S states, A actions, and bound on the hitting time H. This regret bound matches the lower bound in order of time horizon T and is the best-known regret bound for communicating CMDPs in the infinite-horizon undiscounted setting. Empirical results show that, despite its simplicity, our posterior sampling algorithm outperforms the existing algorithms for constrained reinforcement learning.

**ABSTRACT**  
In recent years, Sentiment Analysis (SA) and Emotion Recognition (ER) have been increasingly popular in the Bangla language, which is the seventh most spoken language throughout the entire world. However, the language is structurally complicated, which makes this field arduous to extract emotions in an accurate manner. Several distinct approaches such as the extraction of positive and negative sentiments as well as multiclass emotions, have been implemented in this field of study. Nevertheless, the extraction of multiple sentiments is an almost untouched area in this language. Which involves identifying several feelings based on a single piece of text. Therefore, this study demonstrates a thorough method for constructing an annotated corpus based on scrapped data from Facebook to bridge the gaps in this subject area to overcome the challenges. To make this annotation more fruitful, the context-based approach has been used. Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), a well-known methodology of transformers, have been shown the best results of all methods implemented. Finally, a web application has been developed to demonstrate the performance of the pre-trained top-performer model (BERT) for multi-label ER in Bangla.

**ABSTRACT**  
Federated Learning (FL) is a prominent distributed learning paradigm facilitating collaboration among nodes within an edge network to co-train a global model without centralizing data. By shifting computation to the network edge, FL offers robust and responsive edge-AI solutions and enhance privacy-preservation. However, deploying deep FL models within edge environments is often hindered by communication bottlenecks, data heterogeneity, and memory limitations. To address these challenges jointly, we introduce FeDEQ, a pioneering FL framework that effectively employs deep equilibrium learning and consensus optimization to exploit a compact shared data representation across edge nodes, allowing the derivation of personalized models specific to each node. We delve into a unique model structure composed of an equilibrium layer followed by traditional neural network layers. Here, the equilibrium layer functions as a global feature representation that edge nodes can adapt to personalize their local layers. Capitalizing on FeDEQ's compactness and representation power, we present a novel distributed algorithm rooted in the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) consensus optimization and theoretically establish its convergence for smooth objectives. Experiments across various benchmarks demonstrate that FeDEQ achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art personalized methods while employing models of up to 4 times smaller in communication size and 1.5 times lower memory footprint during training.

**ABSTRACT**  
In multi-task reinforcement learning, it is possible to improve the data efficiency of training agents by transferring knowledge from other different but related tasks. Because the experiences from different tasks are usually biased toward the specific task goals. Traditional methods rely on Kullback-Leibler regularization to stabilize the transfer of knowledge from one task to the others. In this work, we explore the direction of replacing the Kullback-Leibler divergence with a novel Optimal transport-based regularization. By using the Sinkhorn mapping, we can approximate the Optimal transport distance between the state distribution of tasks. The distance is then used as an amortized reward to regularize the amount of sharing information. We experiment our frameworks on several grid-based navigation multi-goal to validate the effectiveness of the approach. The results show that our added Optimal transport-based rewards are able to speed up the learning process of agents and outperforms several baselines on multi-task learning.

**ABSTRACT**  
Computer-based decision systems are widely used to automate decisions in many aspects of everyday life, which include sensitive areas like hiring, loaning and even criminal sentencing. A decision pipeline heavily relies on large volumes of historical real-world data for training its models. However, historical training data often contains gender, racial or other biases which are propagated to the trained models influencing computer-based decisions. In this work, we propose a robust methodology that guarantees the removal of unwanted biases while maximally preserving classification utility. Our approach can always achieve this in a model-independent way by deriving from real-world data the asymptotic dataset that uniquely encodes demographic parity and realism. As a proof-of-principle, we deduce from public census records such an asymptotic dataset from which synthetic samples can be generated to train well-established classifiers. Benchmarking the generalization capability of these classifiers trained on our synthetic data, we confirm the absence of any explicit or implicit bias in the computer-aided decision.

**ABSTRACT**  
Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated a remarkable success across various tasks. However, efficiently serving LLMs has been a challenge due to its large memory bottleneck, specifically in small batch inference settings (e.g. mobile devices). Weight-only quantization can be a promising approach, but sub-4 bit quantization remains a challenge due to large-magnitude activation outliers. To mitigate the undesirable outlier effect, we first propose per-IC quantization, a simple yet effective method that creates quantization groups within each input channel (IC) rather than the conventional per-output channel (OC). Our method is motivated by the observation that activation outliers affect the input dimension of the weight matrix, so similarly grouping the weights in the IC direction can isolate outliers to be within a group. We also find that activation outliers do not dictate quantization difficulty, and inherent weight sensitivities also exist. With per-IC quantization as a new outlier-friendly scheme, we then propose Adaptive Dimensions (AdaDim), a versatile quantization framework that can adapt to various weight sensitivity patterns. We demonstrate the effectiveness of AdaDim by augmenting prior methods such as Round-To-Nearest and GPTQ, showing significant improvements across various language modeling benchmarks for both base (up to +4.7% on MMLU) and instruction-tuned (up to +10% on HumanEval) LLMs.

**ABSTRACT**  
Myocardial infarction (MI) is a severe case of coronary artery disease (CAD) and ultimately, its detection is substantial to prevent progressive damage to the myocardium. In this study, we propose a novel view-fusion model named self-attention fusion network (SAF-Net) to detect MI from multi-view echocardiography recordings. The proposed framework utilizes apical 2-chamber (A2C) and apical 4-chamber (A4C) view echocardiography recordings for classification. Three reference frames are extracted from each recording of both views and deployed pre-trained deep networks to extract highly representative features. The SAF-Net model utilizes a self-attention mechanism to learn dependencies in extracted feature vectors. The proposed model is computationally efficient thanks to its compact architecture having three main parts: a feature embedding to reduce dimensionality, self-attention for view-pooling, and dense layers for the classification. Experimental evaluation is performed using the HMC-QU-TAU dataset which consists of 160 patients with A2C and A4C view echocardiography recordings. The proposed SAF-Net model achieves a high-performance level with 88.26% precision, 77.64% sensitivity, and 78.13% accuracy. The results demonstrate that the SAF-Net model achieves the most accurate MI detection over multi-view echocardiography recordings.

**ABSTRACT**  
Modern DNN-based recommendation systems rely on training-derived embeddings of sparse features. Input sparsity makes obtaining high-quality embeddings for rarely-occurring categories harder as their representations are updated infrequently. We demonstrate a training-time technique to produce superior embeddings via effective cross-category learning and theoretically explain its surprising effectiveness. The scheme, termed the multi-layer embeddings training (MLET), trains embeddings using factorization of the embedding layer, with an inner dimension higher than the target embedding dimension. For inference efficiency, MLET converts the trained two-layer embedding into a single-layer one thus keeping inference-time model size unchanged.   Empirical superiority of MLET is puzzling as its search space is not larger than that of the single-layer embedding. The strong dependence of MLET on the inner dimension is even more surprising. We develop a theory that explains both of these behaviors by showing that MLET creates an adaptive update mechanism modulated by the singular vectors of embeddings. When tested on multiple state-of-the-art recommendation models for click-through rate (CTR) prediction tasks, MLET consistently produces better models, especially for rare items. At constant model quality, MLET allows embedding dimension, and model size, reduction by up to 16x, and 5.8x on average, across the models.

**ABSTRACT**  
Electroencephalography(EEG) classification is a crucial task in neuroscience, neural engineering, and several commercial applications. Traditional EEG classification models, however, have often overlooked or inadequately leveraged the brain's topological information. Recognizing this shortfall, there has been a burgeoning interest in recent years in harnessing the potential of Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to exploit the topological information by modeling features selected from each EEG channel in a graph structure. To further facilitate research in this direction, we introduce GNN4EEG, a versatile and user-friendly toolkit for GNN-based modeling of EEG signals. GNN4EEG comprises three components: (i)A large benchmark constructed with four EEG classification tasks based on EEG data collected from 123 participants. (ii)Easy-to-use implementations on various state-of-the-art GNN-based EEG classification models, e.g., DGCNN, RGNN, etc. (iii)Implementations of comprehensive experimental settings and evaluation protocols, e.g., data splitting protocols, and cross-validation protocols. GNN4EEG is publicly released at https://github.com/Miracle-2001/GNN4EEG.

**ABSTRACT**  
The emerging field of artificial intelligence of things (AIoT, AI+IoT) is driven by the widespread use of intelligent infrastructures and the impressive success of deep learning (DL). With the deployment of DL on various intelligent infrastructures featuring rich sensors and weak DL computing capabilities, a diverse range of AIoT applications has become possible. However, DL models are notoriously resource-intensive. Existing research strives to realize near-/realtime inference of AIoT live data and low-cost training using AIoT datasets on resource-scare infrastructures. Accordingly, the accuracy and responsiveness of DL models are bounded by resource availability. To this end, the algorithm-system co-design that jointly optimizes the resource-friendly DL models and model-adaptive system scheduling improves the runtime resource availability and thus pushes the performance boundary set by the standalone level. Unlike previous surveys on resource-friendly DL models or hand-crafted DL compilers/frameworks with partially fine-tuned components, this survey aims to provide a broader optimization space for more free resource-performance tradeoffs. The cross-level optimization landscape involves various granularity, including the DL model, computation graph, operator, memory schedule, and hardware instructor in both on-device and distributed paradigms. Furthermore, due to the dynamic nature of AIoT context, which includes heterogeneous hardware, agnostic sensing data, varying user-specified performance demands, and resource constraints, this survey explores the context-aware inter-/intra-device controllers for automatic cross-level adaptation. Additionally, we identify some potential directions for resource-efficient AIoT systems. By consolidating problems and techniques scattered over diverse levels, we aim to help readers understand their connections and stimulate further discussions.

**ABSTRACT**  
Many emerging user-facing services adopt Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to improve serving accuracy. When the graph used by a GNN model changes, representations (embedding) of nodes in the graph should be updated accordingly. However, the node representation update is too slow, resulting in either long response latency of user queries (the inference is performed after the update completes) or high staleness problem (the inference is performed based on stale data). Our in-depth analysis shows that the slow update is mainly due to neighbor explosion problem in graphs and duplicated computation. Based on such findings, we propose STAG, a GNN serving framework that enables low latency and low staleness of GNN-based services. It comprises a collaborative serving mechanism and an additivity-based incremental propagation strategy. With the collaborative serving mechanism, only part of node representations are updated during the update phase, and the final representations are calculated in the inference phase. It alleviates the neighbor explosion problem. The additivity-based incremental propagation strategy reuses intermediate data during the update phase, eliminating duplicated computation problem. Experimental results show that STAG accelerates the update phase by 1.3x~90.1x, and greatly reduces staleness time with a slight increase in response latency.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper considers the best policy identification (BPI) problem in online Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs). We are interested in algorithms that are model-free, have low regret, and identify an optimal policy with a high probability. Existing model-free algorithms for online CMDPs with sublinear regret and constraint violation do not provide any convergence guarantee to an optimal policy and provide only average performance guarantees when a policy is uniformly sampled at random from all previously used policies. In this paper, we develop a new algorithm, named Pruning-Refinement-Identification (PRI), based on a fundamental structural property of CMDPs we discover, called limited stochasticity. The property says for a CMDP with $N$ constraints, there exists an optimal policy with at most $N$ stochastic decisions.   The proposed algorithm first identifies at which step and in which state a stochastic decision has to be taken and then fine-tunes the distributions of these stochastic decisions. PRI achieves trio objectives: (i) PRI is a model-free algorithm; and (ii) it outputs a near-optimal policy with a high probability at the end of learning; and (iii) in the tabular setting, PRI guarantees $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{K})$ regret and constraint violation, which significantly improves the best existing regret bound $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(K^{\frac{4}{5}})$ under a mode-free algorithm, where $K$ is the total number of episodes.

**ABSTRACT**  
Deep learning (DL) techniques have recently been applied to anomaly detection (AD), yielding successful outcomes in areas such as finance, medical services, and cloud computing. However, much of the current research evaluates a deep AD algorithm holistically, failing to understand the contributions of individual design choices like loss functions and network architectures. Consequently, the importance of prerequisite steps, such as preprocessing, might be overshadowed by the spotlight on novel loss functions and architectures. In this paper, we address these oversights by posing two questions: (i) Which components (i.e., design choices) of deep AD methods are pivotal in detecting anomalies? (ii) How can we construct tailored AD algorithms for specific datasets by selecting the best design choices automatically, rather than relying on generic, pre-existing solutions? To this end, we introduce ADGym, the first platform designed for comprehensive evaluation and automatic selection of AD design elements in deep methods. Extensive experiments reveal that merely adopting existing leading methods is not ideal. Models crafted using ADGym markedly surpass current state-of-the-art techniques.

**ABSTRACT**  
An electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) is a medical test that measures the heart's electrical activity. ECGs are often used to diagnose and monitor a wide range of heart conditions, including arrhythmias, heart attacks, and heart failure. On the one hand, the conventional ECG requires clinical measurement, which restricts its deployment to medical facilities. On the other hand, single-lead ECG has become popular on wearable devices using administered procedures. An alternative to ECG is Photoplethysmography (PPG), which uses non-invasive, low-cost optical methods to measure cardiac physiology, making it a suitable option for capturing vital heart signs in daily life. As a result, it has become increasingly popular in health monitoring and is used in various clinical and commercial wearable devices. While ECG and PPG correlate strongly, the latter does not offer significant clinical diagnostic value. Here, we propose a subject-independent attention-based deep state-space model to translate PPG signals to corresponding ECG waveforms. The model is highly data-efficient by incorporating prior knowledge in terms of probabilistic graphical models. Notably, the model enables the detection of atrial fibrillation (AFib), the most common heart rhythm disorder in adults, by complementing ECG's accuracy with continuous PPG monitoring. We evaluated the model on 55 subjects from the MIMIC III database. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.

**ABSTRACT**  
Understanding feature representation for deep neural networks (DNNs) remains an open question within the general field of explainable AI. We use principal component analysis (PCA) to study the performance of a k-nearest neighbors classifier (k-NN), nearest class-centers classifier (NCC), and support vector machines on the learned layer-wise representations of a ResNet-18 trained on CIFAR-10. We show that in certain layers, as little as 20% of the intermediate feature-space variance is necessary for high-accuracy classification and that across all layers, the first ~100 PCs completely determine the performance of the k-NN and NCC classifiers. We relate our findings to neural collapse and provide partial evidence for the related phenomenon of intermediate neural collapse. Our preliminary work provides three distinct yet interpretable surrogate models for feature representation with an affine linear model the best performing. We also show that leveraging several surrogate models affords us a clever method to estimate where neural collapse may initially occur within the DNN.

**ABSTRACT**  
Scientific discovery and engineering design are currently limited by the time and cost of physical experiments, selected mostly through trial-and-error and intuition that require deep domain expertise. Numerical simulations present an alternative to physical experiments, but are usually infeasible for complex real-world domains due to the computational requirements of existing numerical methods. Artificial intelligence (AI) presents a potential paradigm shift through the development of fast data-driven surrogate models. In particular, an AI framework, known as neural operators, presents a principled framework for learning mappings between functions defined on continuous domains, e.g., spatiotemporal processes and partial differential equations (PDE). They can extrapolate and predict solutions at new locations unseen during training, i.e., perform zero-shot super-resolution. Neural operators can augment or even replace existing simulators in many applications, such as computational fluid dynamics, weather forecasting, and material modeling, while being 4-5 orders of magnitude faster. Further, neural operators can be integrated with physics and other domain constraints enforced at finer resolutions to obtain high-fidelity solutions and good generalization. Since neural operators are differentiable, they can directly optimize parameters for inverse design and other inverse problems. We believe that neural operators present a transformative approach to simulation and design, enabling rapid research and development.

**ABSTRACT**  
Noise robustness is a key aspect of successful speech applications. Speech enhancement (SE) has been investigated to improve automatic speech recognition accuracy; however, its effectiveness for keyword spotting (KWS) is still under-investigated. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study on single-channel speech enhancement for keyword spotting on the Google Speech Command (GSC) dataset. To investigate robustness to noise, the GSC dataset is augmented with noise signals from the WSJ0 Hipster Ambient Mixtures (WHAM!) noise dataset. Our investigation includes not only applying SE before KWS but also performing joint training of the SE frontend and KWS backend models. Moreover, we explore audio injection, a common approach to reduce distortions by using a weighted average of the enhanced and original signals. Audio injection is then further optimized by using another model that predicts the weight for each utterance. Our investigation reveals that SE can improve KWS accuracy on noisy speech when the backend model is trained on clean speech; however, despite our extensive exploration, it is difficult to improve the KWS accuracy with SE when the backend is trained on noisy speech.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this study, we present a simple multi-channel framework for contrastive learning (MC-SimCLR) to encode 'what' and 'where' of spatial audios. MC-SimCLR learns joint spectral and spatial representations from unlabeled spatial audios, thereby enhancing both event classification and sound localization in downstream tasks. At its core, we propose a multi-level data augmentation pipeline that augments different levels of audio features, including waveforms, Mel spectrograms, and generalized cross-correlation (GCC) features. In addition, we introduce simple yet effective channel-wise augmentation methods to randomly swap the order of the microphones and mask Mel and GCC channels. By using these augmentations, we find that linear layers on top of the learned representation significantly outperform supervised models in terms of both event classification accuracy and localization error. We also perform a comprehensive analysis of the effect of each augmentation method and a comparison of the fine-tuning performance using different amounts of labeled data.

**ABSTRACT**  
In recent years, research on music transcription has focused mainly on architecture design and instrument-specific data acquisition. With the lack of availability of diverse datasets, progress is often limited to solo-instrument tasks such as piano transcription. Several works have explored multi-instrument transcription as a means to bolster the performance of models on low-resource tasks, but these methods face the same data availability issues. We propose Timbre-Trap, a novel framework which unifies music transcription and audio reconstruction by exploiting the strong separability between pitch and timbre. We train a single U-Net to simultaneously estimate pitch salience and reconstruct complex spectral coefficients, selecting between either output during the decoding stage via a simple switch mechanism. In this way, the model learns to produce coefficients corresponding to timbre-less audio, which can be interpreted as pitch salience. We demonstrate that the framework leads to performance comparable to state-of-the-art instrument-agnostic transcription methods, while only requiring a small amount of annotated data.

**ABSTRACT**  
State-of-the-art anomalous sound detection systems often utilize angular margin losses to learn suitable representations of acoustic data using an auxiliary task, which usually is a supervised or self-supervised classification task. The underlying idea is that, in order to solve this auxiliary task, specific information about normal data needs to be captured in the learned representations and that this information is also sufficient to differentiate between normal and anomalous samples. Especially in noisy conditions, discriminative models based on angular margin losses tend to significantly outperform systems based on generative or one-class models. The goal of this work is to investigate why using angular margin losses with auxiliary tasks works well for detecting anomalous sounds. To this end, it is shown, both theoretically and experimentally, that minimizing angular margin losses also minimizes compactness loss while inherently preventing learning trivial solutions. Furthermore, multiple experiments are conducted to show that using a related classification task as an auxiliary task teaches the model to learn representations suitable for detecting anomalous sounds in noisy conditions. Among these experiments are performance evaluations, visualizing the embedding space with t-SNE and visualizing the input representations with respect to the anomaly score using randomized input sampling for explanation.

**ABSTRACT**  
In the trending research of fusing Large Language Models (LLMs) and robotics, we aim to pave the way for innovative development of AI systems that can enable Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) to seamlessly interact with humans in an intuitive manner. We propose OceanChat, a system that leverages a closed-loop LLM-guided task and motion planning framework to tackle AUV missions in the wild. LLMs translate an abstract human command into a high-level goal, while a task planner further grounds the goal into a task sequence with logical constraints. To assist the AUV with understanding the task sequence, we utilize a motion planner to incorporate real-time Lagrangian data streams received by the AUV, thus mapping the task sequence into an executable motion plan. Considering the highly dynamic and partially known nature of the underwater environment, an event-triggered replanning scheme is developed to enhance the system's robustness towards uncertainty. We also build a simulation platform HoloEco that generates photo-realistic simulation for a wide range of AUV applications. Experimental evaluation verifies that the proposed system can achieve improved performance in terms of both success rate and computation time.

**ABSTRACT**  
Mobile robots often rely on pre-existing maps for effective path planning and navigation. However, when these maps are unavailable, particularly in unfamiliar environments, a different approach become essential. This paper introduces DynaCon, a novel system designed to provide mobile robots with contextual awareness and dynamic adaptability during navigation, eliminating the reliance of traditional maps. DynaCon integrates real-time feedback with an object server, prompt engineering, and navigation modules. By harnessing the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), DynaCon not only understands patterns within given numeric series but also excels at categorizing objects into matched spaces.

**ABSTRACT**  
A flurry of recent work has demonstrated that pre-trained large language models (LLMs) can be effective task planners for a variety of single-robot tasks. The planning performance of LLMs is significantly improved via prompting techniques, such as in-context learning or re-prompting with state feedback, placing new importance on the token budget for the context window. An under-explored but natural next direction is to investigate LLMs as multi-robot task planners. However, long-horizon, heterogeneous multi-robot planning introduces new challenges of coordination while also pushing up against the limits of context window length. It is therefore critical to find token-efficient LLM planning frameworks that are also able to reason about the complexities of multi-robot coordination. In this work, we compare the task success rate and token efficiency of four multi-agent communication frameworks (centralized, decentralized, and two hybrid) as applied to four coordination-dependent multi-agent 2D task scenarios for increasing numbers of agents. We find that a hybrid framework achieves better task success rates across all four tasks and scales better to more agents. We further demonstrate the hybrid frameworks in 3D simulations where the vision-to-text problem and dynamical errors are considered.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper presents a novel framework for learning robust bipedal walking by combining a data-driven state representation with a Reinforcement Learning (RL) based locomotion policy. The framework utilizes an autoencoder to learn a low-dimensional latent space that captures the complex dynamics of bipedal locomotion from existing locomotion data. This reduced dimensional state representation is then used as states for training a robust RL-based gait policy, eliminating the need for heuristic state selections or the use of template models for gait planning. The results demonstrate that the learned latent variables are disentangled and directly correspond to different gaits or speeds, such as moving forward, backward, or walking in place. Compared to traditional template model-based approaches, our framework exhibits superior performance and robustness in simulation. The trained policy effectively tracks a wide range of walking speeds and demonstrates good generalization capabilities to unseen scenarios.

**ABSTRACT**  
Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown great promise for efficiently learning force control policies in peg-in-hole tasks. However, robots often face difficulties due to visual occlusions by the gripper and uncertainties in the initial grasping pose of the peg. These challenges often restrict force-controlled insertion policies to situations where the peg is rigidly fixed to the end-effector. While vision-based tactile sensors offer rich tactile feedback that could potentially address these issues, utilizing them to learn effective tactile policies is both computationally intensive and difficult to generalize. In this paper, we propose a robust tactile insertion policy that can align the tilted peg with the hole using active inference, without the need for extensive training on large datasets. Our approach employs a dual-policy architecture: one policy focuses on insertion, integrating force control and RL to guide the object into the hole, while the other policy performs active inference based on tactile feedback to align the tilted peg with the hole. In real-world experiments, our dual-policy architecture achieved 90% success rate into a hole with a clearance of less than 0.1 mm, significantly outperforming previous methods that lack tactile sensory feedback (5%). To assess the generalizability of our alignment policy, we conducted experiments with five different pegs, demonstrating its effective adaptation to multiple objects.

**ABSTRACT**  
Re-grasp manipulation leverages on ergonomic tools to assist humans in accomplishing diverse tasks. In certain scenarios, humans often employ external forces to effortlessly and precisely re-grasp tools like a hammer. Previous development on controllers for in-grasp sliding motion using passive dynamic actions (e.g.,gravity) relies on apprehension of finger-object contact information, and requires customized design for individual objects with varied geometry and weight distribution. It limits their adaptability to diverse objects. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end sliding motion controller based on imitation learning (IL) that necessitates minimal prior knowledge of object mechanics, relying solely on object position information. To expedite training convergence, we utilize a data glove to collect expert data trajectories and train the policy through Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL). Simulation results demonstrate the controller's versatility in performing in-hand sliding tasks with objects of varying friction coefficients, geometric shapes, and masses. By migrating to a physical system using visual position estimation, the controller demonstrated an average success rate of 86%, surpassing the baseline algorithm's success rate of 35% of Behavior Cloning(BC) and 20% of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).

**ABSTRACT**  
This work presents a hierarchical framework for bipedal locomotion that combines a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based high-level (HL) planner policy for the online generation of task space commands with a model-based low-level (LL) controller to track the desired task space trajectories. Different from traditional end-to-end learning approaches, our HL policy takes insights from the angular momentum-based linear inverted pendulum (ALIP) to carefully design the observation and action spaces of the Markov Decision Process (MDP). This simple yet effective design creates an insightful mapping between a low-dimensional state that effectively captures the complex dynamics of bipedal locomotion and a set of task space outputs that shape the walking gait of the robot. The HL policy is agnostic to the task space LL controller, which increases the flexibility of the design and generalization of the framework to other bipedal robots. This hierarchical design results in a learning-based framework with improved performance, data efficiency, and robustness compared with the ALIP model-based approach and state-of-the-art learning-based frameworks for bipedal locomotion. The proposed hierarchical controller is tested in three different robots, Rabbit, a five-link underactuated planar biped; Walker2D, a seven-link fully-actuated planar biped; and Digit, a 3D humanoid robot with 20 actuated joints. The trained policy naturally learns human-like locomotion behaviors and is able to effectively track a wide range of walking speeds while preserving the robustness and stability of the walking gait even under adversarial conditions.

**ABSTRACT**  
Shifting from traditional control strategies to Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) for legged robots poses inherent challenges, especially when addressing real-world physical constraints during training. While high-fidelity simulations provide significant benefits, they often bypass these essential physical limitations. In this paper, we experiment with the Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) framework instead of the conventional unconstrained RL for robotic applications. We perform a comparative study of different constrained policy optimization algorithms to identify suitable methods for practical implementation. Our robot experiments demonstrate the critical role of incorporating physical constraints, yielding successful sim-to-real transfers, and reducing operational errors on physical systems. The CMDP formulation streamlines the training process by separately handling constraints from rewards. Our findings underscore the potential of constrained RL for the effective development and deployment of learned controllers in robotics.

**ABSTRACT**  
Adversarial object rearrangement in the real world (e.g., previously unseen or oversized items in kitchens and stores) could benefit from understanding task scenes, which inherently entail heterogeneous components such as current objects, goal objects, and environmental constraints. The semantic relationships among these components are distinct from each other and crucial for multi-skilled robots to perform efficiently in everyday scenarios. We propose a hierarchical robotic manipulation system that learns the underlying relationships and maximizes the collaborative power of its diverse skills (e.g., pick-place, push) for rearranging adversarial objects in constrained environments. The high-level coordinator employs a heterogeneous graph neural network (HetGNN), which reasons about the current objects, goal objects, and environmental constraints; the low-level 3D Convolutional Neural Network-based actors execute the action primitives. Our approach is trained entirely in simulation, and achieved an average success rate of 87.88% and a planning cost of 12.82 in real-world experiments, surpassing all baseline methods.

**ABSTRACT**  
Large Language Models (LLMs), although powerful in general domains, often perform poorly on domain-specific tasks like medical question answering (QA). Moreover, they tend to function as "black-boxes," making it challenging to modify their behavior. Addressing this, our study delves into model editing utilizing in-context learning, aiming to improve LLM responses without the need for fine-tuning or retraining. Specifically, we propose a comprehensive retrieval strategy to extract medical facts from an external knowledge base, and then we incorporate them into the query prompt for the LLM. Focusing on medical QA using the MedQA-SMILE dataset, we evaluate the impact of different retrieval models and the number of facts provided to the LLM. Notably, our edited Vicuna model exhibited an accuracy improvement from 44.46% to 48.54%. This work underscores the potential of model editing to enhance LLM performance, offering a practical approach to mitigate the challenges of black-box LLMs.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recent works in end-to-end speech-to-text translation (ST) have proposed multi-tasking methods with soft parameter sharing which leverage machine translation (MT) data via secondary encoders that map text inputs to an eventual cross-modal representation. In this work, we instead propose a ST/MT multi-tasking framework with hard parameter sharing in which all model parameters are shared cross-modally. Our method reduces the speech-text modality gap via a pre-processing stage which converts speech and text inputs into two discrete token sequences of similar length -- this allows models to indiscriminately process both modalities simply using a joint vocabulary. With experiments on MuST-C, we demonstrate that our multi-tasking framework improves attentional encoder-decoder, Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC), transducer, and joint CTC/attention models by an average of +0.5 BLEU without any external MT data. Further, we show that this framework incorporates external MT data, yielding +0.8 BLEU, and also improves transfer learning from pre-trained textual models, yielding +1.8 BLEU.

**ABSTRACT**  
Large Language Models (LLMs) present an intriguing avenue for exploration in the field of formal theorem proving. Nevertheless, their full potential, particularly concerning the mitigation of hallucinations and refinement through prover error messages, remains an area that has yet to be thoroughly investigated. To enhance the effectiveness of LLMs in the field, we introduce the Lyra, a new framework that employs two distinct correction mechanisms: Tool Correction (TC) and Conjecture Correction (CC). To implement Tool Correction in the post-processing of formal proofs, we leverage prior knowledge to utilize predefined prover tools (e.g., Sledgehammer) for guiding the replacement of incorrect tools. Tool Correction significantly contributes to mitigating hallucinations, thereby improving the overall accuracy of the proof. In addition, we introduce Conjecture Correction, an error feedback mechanism designed to interact with prover to refine formal proof conjectures with prover error messages. Compared to the previous refinement framework, the proposed Conjecture Correction refines generation with instruction but does not collect paired (generation, error & refinement) prompts. Our method has achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both miniF2F validation (48.0% -> 55.3%) and test (45.5% -> 51.2%). We also present 3 IMO problems solved by Lyra. We believe Tool Correction (post-process for hallucination mitigation) and Conjecture Correction (subgoal adjustment from interaction with environment) could provide a promising avenue for future research in this field.

**ABSTRACT**  
Speech signals, typically sampled at rates in the tens of thousands per second, contain redundancies, evoking inefficiencies in sequence modeling. High-dimensional speech features such as spectrograms are often used as the input for the subsequent model. However, they can still be redundant. Recent investigations proposed the use of discrete speech units derived from self-supervised learning representations, which significantly compresses the size of speech data. Applying various methods, such as de-duplication and subword modeling, can further compress the speech sequence length. Hence, training time is significantly reduced while retaining notable performance. In this study, we undertake a comprehensive and systematic exploration into the application of discrete units within end-to-end speech processing models. Experiments on 12 automatic speech recognition, 3 speech translation, and 1 spoken language understanding corpora demonstrate that discrete units achieve reasonably good results in almost all the settings. We intend to release our configurations and trained models to foster future research efforts.

**ABSTRACT**  
There is a rapidly growing number of open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) and benchmark datasets to compare them. While some models dominate these benchmarks, no single model typically achieves the best accuracy in all tasks and use cases. In this work, we address the challenge of selecting the best LLM out of a collection of models for new tasks. We propose a new formulation for the problem, in which benchmark datasets are repurposed to learn a "router" model for this LLM selection, and we show that this problem can be reduced to a collection of binary classification tasks. We demonstrate the utility and limitations of learning model routers from various benchmark datasets, where we consistently improve performance upon using any single model for all tasks.

**ABSTRACT**  
With the advancement of telemedicine, both researchers and medical practitioners are working hand-in-hand to develop various techniques to automate various medical operations, such as diagnosis report generation. In this paper, we first present a multi-modal clinical conversation summary generation task that takes a clinician-patient interaction (both textual and visual information) and generates a succinct synopsis of the conversation. We propose a knowledge-infused, multi-modal, multi-tasking medical domain identification and clinical conversation summary generation (MM-CliConSummation) framework. It leverages an adapter to infuse knowledge and visual features and unify the fused feature vector using a gated mechanism. Furthermore, we developed a multi-modal, multi-intent clinical conversation summarization corpus annotated with intent, symptom, and summary. The extensive set of experiments, both quantitatively and qualitatively, led to the following findings: (a) critical significance of visuals, (b) more precise and medical entity preserving summary with additional knowledge infusion, and (c) a correlation between medical department identification and clinical synopsis generation. Furthermore, the dataset and source code are available at https://github.com/NLP-RL/MM-CliConSummation.

**ABSTRACT**  
With the recent explosion of large language models (LLMs), such as Generative Pretrained Transformers (GPT), the need to understand the ability of humans and machines to comprehend semantic language meaning has entered a new phase. This requires interdisciplinary research that bridges the fields of cognitive science and natural language processing (NLP). This pilot study aims to provide insights into individuals' neural states during a semantic relation reading-comprehension task. We propose jointly analyzing LLMs, eye-gaze, and electroencephalographic (EEG) data to study how the brain processes words with varying degrees of relevance to a keyword during reading. We also use a feature engineering approach to improve the fixation-related EEG data classification while participants read words with high versus low relevance to the keyword. The best validation accuracy in this word-level classification is over 60\% across 12 subjects. Words of high relevance to the inference keyword had significantly more eye fixations per word: 1.0584 compared to 0.6576 when excluding no-fixation words, and 1.5126 compared to 1.4026 when including them. This study represents the first attempt to classify brain states at a word level using LLM knowledge. It provides valuable insights into human cognitive abilities and the realm of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), and offers guidance for developing potential reading-assisted technologies.

**ABSTRACT**  
Advancements in deep neural networks have allowed automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems to attain human parity on several publicly available clean speech datasets. However, even state-of-the-art ASR systems experience performance degradation when confronted with adverse conditions, as a well-trained acoustic model is sensitive to variations in the speech domain, e.g., background noise. Intuitively, humans address this issue by relying on their linguistic knowledge: the meaning of ambiguous spoken terms is usually inferred from contextual cues thereby reducing the dependency on the auditory system. Inspired by this observation, we introduce the first open-source benchmark to utilize external large language models (LLMs) for ASR error correction, where N-best decoding hypotheses provide informative elements for true transcription prediction. This approach is a paradigm shift from the traditional language model rescoring strategy that can only select one candidate hypothesis as the output transcription. The proposed benchmark contains a novel dataset, HyPoradise (HP), encompassing more than 334,000 pairs of N-best hypotheses and corresponding accurate transcriptions across prevalent speech domains. Given this dataset, we examine three types of error correction techniques based on LLMs with varying amounts of labeled hypotheses-transcription pairs, which gains a significant word error rate (WER) reduction. Experimental evidence demonstrates the proposed technique achieves a breakthrough by surpassing the upper bound of traditional re-ranking based methods. More surprisingly, LLM with reasonable prompt and its generative capability can even correct those tokens that are missing in N-best list. We make our results publicly accessible for reproducible pipelines with released pre-trained models, thus providing a new evaluation paradigm for ASR error correction with LLMs.

**ABSTRACT**  
Scripted dialogues such as movie and TV subtitles constitute a widespread source of training data for conversational NLP models. However, the linguistic characteristics of those dialogues are notably different from those observed in corpora of spontaneous interactions. This difference is particularly marked for communicative feedback and grounding phenomena such as backchannels, acknowledgments, or clarification requests. Such signals are known to constitute a key part of the conversation flow and are used by the dialogue participants to provide feedback to one another on their perception of the ongoing interaction. This paper presents a quantitative analysis of such communicative feedback phenomena in both subtitles and spontaneous conversations. Based on dialogue data in English, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Norwegian and Chinese, we extract both lexical statistics and classification outputs obtained with a neural dialogue act tagger. Two main findings of this empirical study are that (1) conversational feedback is markedly less frequent in subtitles than in spontaneous dialogues and (2) subtitles contain a higher proportion of negative feedback. Furthermore, we show that dialogue responses generated by large language models also follow the same underlying trends and include comparatively few occurrences of communicative feedback, except when those models are explicitly fine-tuned on spontaneous dialogues.

**ABSTRACT**  
We explore the ability of large language models (LLMs) to act as ASR post-processors that perform rescoring and error correction. Our focus is on instruction prompting to let LLMs perform these task without fine-tuning, for which we evaluate different prompting schemes, both zero- and few-shot in-context learning, and a novel task-activating prompting (TAP) method that combines instruction and demonstration. Using a pre-trained first-pass system and rescoring output on two out-of-domain tasks (ATIS and WSJ), we show that rescoring only by in-context learning with frozen LLMs achieves results that are competitive with rescoring by domain-tuned LMs. By combining prompting techniques with fine-tuning we achieve error rates below the N-best oracle level, showcasing the generalization power of the LLMs.

Despite these successes, there remains a dearth of research dedicated to the NLP problem-solving abilities of LLMs. To fill the gap in this area, we present a unique benchmarking dataset, NLPBench, comprising 378 college-level NLP questions spanning various NLP topics sourced from Yale University's prior final exams. NLPBench includes questions with context, in which multiple sub-questions share the same public information, and diverse question types, including multiple choice, short answer, and math. Our evaluation, centered on LLMs such as GPT-3.5/4, PaLM-2, and LLAMA-2, incorporates advanced prompting strategies like the chain-of-thought (CoT) and tree-of-thought (ToT). Our study reveals that the effectiveness of the advanced prompting strategies can be inconsistent, occasionally damaging LLM performance, especially in smaller models like the LLAMA-2 (13b). Furthermore, our manual assessment illuminated specific shortcomings in LLMs' scientific problem-solving skills, with weaknesses in logical decomposition and reasoning notably affecting results.

**ABSTRACT**  
Multi-label aspect category detection is intended to detect multiple aspect categories occurring in a given sentence. Since aspect category detection often suffers from limited datasets and data sparsity, the prototypical network with attention mechanisms has been applied for few-shot aspect category detection. Nevertheless, most of the prototypical networks used so far calculate the prototypes by taking the mean value of all the instances in the support set. This seems to ignore the variations between instances in multi-label aspect category detection. Also, several related works utilize label text information to enhance the attention mechanism. However, the label text information is often short and limited, and not specific enough to discern categories. In this paper, we first introduce support set attention along with the augmented label information to mitigate the noise at word-level for each support set instance. Moreover, we use a sentence-level attention mechanism that gives different weights to each instance in the support set in order to compute prototypes by weighted averaging. Finally, the calculated prototypes are further used in conjunction with query instances to compute query attention and thereby eliminate noises from the query set. Experimental results on the Yelp dataset show that our proposed method is useful and outperforms all baselines in four different scenarios.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper describes the FBK's participation in the Simultaneous Translation and Automatic Subtitling tracks of the IWSLT 2023 Evaluation Campaign. Our submission focused on the use of direct architectures to perform both tasks: for the simultaneous one, we leveraged the knowledge already acquired by offline-trained models and directly applied a policy to obtain the real-time inference; for the subtitling one, we adapted the direct ST model to produce well-formed subtitles and exploited the same architecture to produce timestamps needed for the subtitle synchronization with audiovisual content. Our English-German SimulST system shows a reduced computational-aware latency compared to the one achieved by the top-ranked systems in the 2021 and 2022 rounds of the task, with gains of up to 3.5 BLEU. Our automatic subtitling system outperforms the only existing solution based on a direct system by 3.7 and 1.7 SubER in English-German and English-Spanish respectively.

**ABSTRACT**  
Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable generalization capability with exceptional performance in various language modeling tasks. However, they still exhibit inherent limitations in precisely capturing and returning grounded knowledge. While existing work has explored utilizing knowledge graphs to enhance language modeling via joint training and customized model architectures, applying this to LLMs is problematic owing to their large number of parameters and high computational cost. In addition, how to leverage the pre-trained LLMs and avoid training a customized model from scratch remains an open question. In this work, we propose Graph Neural Prompting (GNP), a novel plug-and-play method to assist pre-trained LLMs in learning beneficial knowledge from KGs. GNP encompasses various designs, including a standard graph neural network encoder, a cross-modality pooling module, a domain projector, and a self-supervised link prediction objective. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the superiority of GNP on both commonsense and biomedical reasoning tasks across different LLM sizes and settings.

**ABSTRACT**  
Chain-of-thought reasoning, a cognitive process fundamental to human intelligence, has garnered significant attention in the realm of artificial intelligence and natural language processing. However, there still remains a lack of a comprehensive survey for this arena. To this end, we take the first step and present a thorough survey of this research field carefully and widely. We use X-of-Thought to refer to Chain-of-Thought in a broad sense. In detail, we systematically organize the current research according to the taxonomies of methods, including XoT construction, XoT structure variants, and enhanced XoT. Additionally, we describe XoT with frontier applications, covering planning, tool use, and distillation. Furthermore, we address challenges and discuss some future directions, including faithfulness, multi-modal, and theory. We hope this survey serves as a valuable resource for researchers seeking to innovate within the domain of chain-of-thought reasoning.

**ABSTRACT**  
Conversational interfaces powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently become a popular way to obtain feedback during document editing. However, standard chat-based conversational interfaces do not support transparency and verifiability of the editing changes that they suggest. To give the author more agency when editing with an LLM, we present InkSync, an editing interface that suggests executable edits directly within the document being edited. Because LLMs are known to introduce factual errors, Inksync also supports a 3-stage approach to mitigate this risk: Warn authors when a suggested edit introduces new information, help authors Verify the new information's accuracy through external search, and allow an auditor to perform an a-posteriori verification by Auditing the document via a trace of all auto-generated content. Two usability studies confirm the effectiveness of InkSync's components when compared to standard LLM-based chat interfaces, leading to more accurate, more efficient editing, and improved user experience.

**ABSTRACT**  
Machine learning (ML) is crucial in network anomaly detection for proactive threat hunting, reducing detection and response times significantly. However, challenges in model training, maintenance, and frequent false positives impact its acceptance and reliability. Explainable AI (XAI) attempts to mitigate these issues, allowing cybersecurity teams to assess AI-generated alerts with confidence, but has seen limited acceptance from incident responders. Large Language Models (LLMs) present a solution through discerning patterns in extensive information and adapting to different functional requirements. We present HuntGPT, a specialized intrusion detection dashboard applying a Random Forest classifier using the KDD99 dataset, integrating XAI frameworks like SHAP and Lime for user-friendly and intuitive model interaction, and combined with a GPT-3.5 Turbo, it delivers threats in an understandable format. The paper delves into the system's architecture, components, and technical accuracy, assessed through Certified Information Security Manager (CISM) Practice Exams, evaluating response quality across six metrics. The results demonstrate that conversational agents, supported by LLM and integrated with XAI, provide robust, explainable, and actionable AI solutions in intrusion detection, enhancing user understanding and interactive experience.

**ABSTRACT**  
Privacy policies outline the data practices of Online Social Networks (OSN) to comply with privacy regulations such as the EU-GDPR and CCPA. Several ontologies for modeling privacy regulations, policies, and compliance have emerged in recent years. However, they are limited in various ways: (1) they specifically model what is required of privacy policies according to one specific privacy regulation such as GDPR; (2) they provide taxonomies of concepts but are not sufficiently axiomatized to afford automated reasoning with them; and (3) they do not model data practices of privacy policies in sufficient detail to allow assessing the transparency of policies. This paper presents an OWL Ontology for Privacy Policies of OSNs, OPPO, that aims to fill these gaps by formalizing detailed data practices from OSNS' privacy policies. OPPO is grounded in BFO, IAO, OMRSE, and OBI, and its design is guided by the use case of representing and reasoning over the content of OSNs' privacy policies and evaluating policies' transparency in greater detail.

**ABSTRACT**  
Network-on-Chip (NoC) is widely used as the internal communication fabric in today's multicore System-on-Chip (SoC) designs. Security of the on-chip communication is crucial because exploiting any vulnerability in shared NoC would be a goldmine for an attacker. NoC security relies on effective countermeasures against diverse attacks. We investigate the security strength of existing anonymous routing protocols in NoC architectures. Specifically, this paper makes two important contributions. We show that the existing anonymous routing is vulnerable to machine learning (ML) based flow correlation attacks on NoCs. We propose a lightweight anonymous routing that use traffic obfuscation techniques which can defend against ML-based flow correlation attacks. Experimental studies using both real and synthetic traffic reveal that our proposed attack is successful against state-of-the-art anonymous routing in NoC architectures with a high accuracy (up to 99%) for diverse traffic patterns, while our lightweight countermeasure can defend against ML-based attacks with minor hardware and performance overhead.

**ABSTRACT**  
Scientific research is increasingly reliant on computational methods, posing challenges for ensuring research reproducibility. This study focuses on the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and introduces a new framework for evaluating AI platforms for reproducibility from a cyber security standpoint to address the security challenges associated with AI research. Using this framework, five popular AI reproducibility platforms; Floydhub, BEAT, Codalab, Kaggle, and OpenML were assessed. The analysis revealed that none of these platforms fully incorporates the necessary cyber security measures essential for robust reproducibility. Kaggle and Codalab, however, performed better in terms of implementing cyber security measures covering aspects like security, privacy, usability, and trust. Consequently, the study provides tailored recommendations for different user scenarios, including individual researchers, small laboratories, and large corporations. It emphasizes the importance of integrating specific cyber security features into AI platforms to address the challenges associated with AI reproducibility, ultimately advancing reproducibility in this field. Moreover, the proposed framework can be applied beyond AI platforms, serving as a versatile tool for evaluating a wide range of systems and applications from a cyber security perspective.

**ABSTRACT**  
In order to assess the risks of a network system, it is important to investigate the behaviors of attackers after successful exploitation, which is called post-exploitation. Although there are various efficient tools supporting post-exploitation implementation, no application can automate this process. Most of the steps of this process are completed by experts who have profound knowledge of security, known as penetration testers or pen-testers. To this end, our study proposes the Raij\=u framework, a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-driven automation approach that assists pen-testers in quickly implementing the process of post-exploitation for security-level evaluation in network systems. We implement two RL algorithms, Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), to train specialized agents capable of making intelligent actions, which are Metasploit modules to automatically launch attacks of privileges escalation, gathering hashdump, and lateral movement. By leveraging RL, we aim to empower these agents with the ability to autonomously select and execute actions that can exploit vulnerabilities in target systems. This approach allows us to automate certain aspects of the penetration testing workflow, making it more efficient and responsive to emerging threats and vulnerabilities. The experiments are performed in four real environments with agents trained in thousands of episodes. The agents automatically select actions and launch attacks on the environments and achieve over 84\% of successful attacks with under 55 attack steps given. Moreover, the A2C algorithm has proved extremely effective in the selection of proper actions for automation of post-exploitation.

**ABSTRACT**  
In IEEE 1609.2 and IEEE 1609.2.1 standards for Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) secure communication, various security algorithms based on Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) have been adopted and designed. To enhance the efficiency of the Security Credential Management System (SCMS), this study evaluates the computational time for key generation, key expansion, signature generation, and signature verification under different security strengths. This study discusses relevant techniques based on Elliptic Curve Qu-Vanstone (ECQV) implicit certificates, analyzes the length of uncompressed elliptic curve points, compressed elliptic curve points, explicit certificates, and implicit certificates. Furthermore, this study proposes mathematical models to demonstrate the probability of ECQV cracking and provides suggestions for mitigating ECQV cracking risks.

**ABSTRACT**  
One of the most pressing threats to computing systems is software vulnerabilities, which can compromise both hardware and software components. Existing methods for vulnerability detection remain suboptimal. Traditional techniques are both time-consuming and labor-intensive, while machine-learning-based approaches often underperform when applied to complex datasets, due to their inability to capture high-dimensional relationships. Previous deep-learning strategies also fall short in capturing sufficient feature information. Although self-attention mechanisms can process information over long distances, they fail to capture structural information. In this paper, we introduce DefectHunter, an innovative model for vulnerability identification that employs the Conformer mechanism. This mechanism fuses self-attention with convolutional networks to capture both local, position-wise features and global, content-based interactions. Furthermore, we optimize the self-attention mechanisms to mitigate the issue of excessive attention heads introducing extraneous noise by adjusting the denominator. We evaluated DefectHunter against ten baseline methods using six industrial and two highly complex datasets. On the QEMU dataset, DefectHunter exhibited a 20.62\% improvement in accuracy over Pongo-70B, and for the CWE-754 dataset, its accuracy was 14.64\% higher. To investigate how DefectHunter comprehends vulnerabilities, we conducted a case study, which revealed that our model effectively understands the mechanisms underlying vulnerabilities.

**ABSTRACT**  
Artificial neural networks typically struggle in generalizing to out-of-context examples. One reason for this limitation is caused by having datasets that incorporate only partial information regarding the potential correlational structure of the world. In this work, we propose TIDA (Targeted Image-editing Data Augmentation), a targeted data augmentation method focused on improving models' human-like abilities (e.g., gender recognition) by filling the correlational structure gap using a text-to-image generative model. More specifically, TIDA identifies specific skills in captions describing images (e.g., the presence of a specific gender in the image), changes the caption (e.g., "woman" to "man"), and then uses a text-to-image model to edit the image in order to match the novel caption (e.g., uniquely changing a woman to a man while maintaining the context identical). Based on the Flickr30K benchmark, we show that, compared with the original data set, a TIDA-enhanced dataset related to gender, color, and counting abilities induces better performance in several image captioning metrics. Furthermore, on top of relying on the classical BLEU metric, we conduct a fine-grained analysis of the improvements of our models against the baseline in different ways. We compared text-to-image generative models and found different behaviors of the image captioning models in terms of encoding visual encoding and textual decoding.

**ABSTRACT**  
The quality of pre-training data plays a critical role in the performance of foundation models. Popular foundation models often design their own recipe for data filtering, which makes it hard to analyze and compare different data filtering approaches. DataComp is a new benchmark dedicated to evaluating different methods for data filtering. This paper describes our learning and solution when participating in the DataComp challenge. Our filtering strategy includes three stages: single-modality filtering, cross-modality filtering, and data distribution alignment. We integrate existing methods and propose new solutions, such as computing CLIP score on horizontally flipped images to mitigate the interference of scene text, using vision and language models to retrieve training samples for target downstream tasks, rebalancing the data distribution to improve the efficiency of allocating the computational budget, etc. We slice and dice our design choices, provide in-depth analysis, and discuss open questions. Our approach outperforms the best method from the DataComp paper by over 4% on the average performance of 38 tasks and by over 2% on ImageNet.

**ABSTRACT**  
City modeling and generation have attracted an increased interest in various applications, including gaming, urban planning, and autonomous driving. Unlike previous works focused on the generation of single objects or indoor scenes, the huge volumes of spatial data in cities pose a challenge to the generative models. Furthermore, few publicly available 3D real-world city datasets also hinder the development of methods for city generation. In this paper, we first collect over 3,000,000 geo-referenced objects for the city of New York, Zurich, Tokyo, Berlin, Boston and several other large cities. Based on this dataset, we propose AETree, a tree-structured auto-encoder neural network, for city generation. Specifically, we first propose a novel Spatial-Geometric Distance (SGD) metric to measure the similarity between building layouts and then construct a binary tree over the raw geometric data of building based on the SGD metric. Next, we present a tree-structured network whose encoder learns to extract and merge spatial information from bottom-up iteratively. The resulting global representation is reversely decoded for reconstruction or generation. To address the issue of long-dependency as the level of the tree increases, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Cell is employed as a basic network element of the proposed AETree. Moreover, we introduce a novel metric, Overlapping Area Ratio (OAR), to quantitatively evaluate the generation results. Experiments on the collected dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model on 2D and 3D city generation. Furthermore, the latent features learned by AETree can serve downstream urban planning applications.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recent vision-language models are driven by large-scale pretrained models. However, adapting pretrained models on limited data presents challenges such as overfitting, catastrophic forgetting, and the cross-modal gap between vision and language. We introduce a parameter-efficient method to address these challenges, combining multimodal prompt learning and a transformer-based mapping network, while keeping the pretrained models frozen. Our experiments on several video question answering benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our approach in terms of performance and parameter efficiency on both zero-shot and few-shot settings.

**ABSTRACT**  
There is a bias in the inference pipeline of most diffusion models. This bias arises from a signal leak whose distribution deviates from the noise distribution, creating a discrepancy between training and inference processes. We demonstrate that this signal-leak bias is particularly significant when models are tuned to a specific style, causing sub-optimal style matching. Recent research tries to avoid the signal leakage during training. We instead show how we can exploit this signal-leak bias in existing diffusion models to allow more control over the generated images. This enables us to generate images with more varied brightness, and images that better match a desired style or color. By modeling the distribution of the signal leak in the spatial frequency and pixel domains, and including a signal leak in the initial latent, we generate images that better match expected results without any additional training.

**ABSTRACT**  
In computer vision, 2D convolution is arguably the most important operation performed by a ConvNet. Unsurprisingly, it has been the focus of intense software and hardware optimization and enjoys highly efficient implementations. In this work, we ask an intriguing question: can we make a ConvNet work without 2D convolutions? Surprisingly, we find that the answer is yes -- we show that a ConvNet consisting entirely of 1D convolutions can do just as well as 2D on ImageNet classification. Specifically, we find that one key ingredient to a high-performing 1D ConvNet is oriented 1D kernels: 1D kernels that are oriented not just horizontally or vertically, but also at other angles. Our experiments show that oriented 1D convolutions can not only replace 2D convolutions but also augment existing architectures with large kernels, leading to improved accuracy with minimal FLOPs increase. A key contribution of this work is a highly-optimized custom CUDA implementation of oriented 1D kernels, specialized to the depthwise convolution setting. Our benchmarks demonstrate that our custom CUDA implementation almost perfectly realizes the theoretical advantage of 1D convolution: it is faster than a native horizontal convolution for any arbitrary angle.

**ABSTRACT**  
The recent progress in Large Language Models (LLM) has spurred various advancements in image-language conversation agents, while how to build a proficient video-based dialogue system is still under exploration. Considering the extensive scale of LLM and visual backbone, minimal GPU memory is left for facilitating effective temporal modeling, which is crucial for comprehending and providing feedback on videos. To this end, we propose Branching Temporal Adapter (BT-Adapter), a novel method for extending image-language pretrained models into the video domain. Specifically, BT-Adapter serves as a plug-and-use temporal modeling branch alongside the pretrained visual encoder, which is tuned while keeping the backbone frozen. Just pretrained once, BT-Adapter can be seamlessly integrated into all image conversation models using this version of CLIP, enabling video conversations without the need for video instructions. Besides, we develop a unique asymmetric token masking strategy inside the branch with tailor-made training tasks for BT-Adapter, facilitating faster convergence and better results. Thanks to BT-Adapter, we are able to empower existing multimodal dialogue models with strong video understanding capabilities without incurring excessive GPU costs. Without bells and whistles, BT-Adapter achieves (1) state-of-the-art zero-shot results on various video tasks using thousands of fewer GPU hours. (2) better performance than current video chatbots without any video instruction tuning. (3) state-of-the-art results of video chatting using video instruction tuning, outperforming previous SOTAs by a large margin.

**ABSTRACT**  
Person re-identification (ReID) is a well-known problem in the field of computer vision. The primary objective is to identify a specific individual within a gallery of images. However, this task is challenging due to various factors, such as pose variations, illumination changes, obstructions, and the presence ofconfusing backgrounds. Existing ReID methods often fail to capture discriminative features (e.g., head, shoes, backpacks) and instead capture irrelevant features when the target is occluded. Motivated by the success of part-based and attention-based ReID methods, we improve AlignedReID++ and present AaP-ReID, a more effective method for person ReID that incorporates channel-wise attention into a ResNet-based architecture. Our method incorporates the Channel-Wise Attention Bottleneck (CWAbottleneck) block and can learn discriminating features by dynamically adjusting the importance ofeach channel in the feature maps. We evaluated Aap-ReID on three benchmark datasets: Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID, and CUHK03. When compared with state-of-the-art person ReID methods, we achieve competitive results with rank-1 accuracies of 95.6% on Market-1501, 90.6% on DukeMTMC-reID, and 82.4% on CUHK03.

**ABSTRACT**  
We demonstrate a compact, cost-effective snapshot spectral imaging system named Aperture Diffraction Imaging Spectrometer (ADIS), which consists only of an imaging lens with an ultra-thin orthogonal aperture mask and a mosaic filter sensor, requiring no additional physical footprint compared to common RGB cameras. Then we introduce a new optical design that each point in the object space is multiplexed to discrete encoding locations on the mosaic filter sensor by diffraction-based spatial-spectral projection engineering generated from the orthogonal mask. The orthogonal projection is uniformly accepted to obtain a weakly calibration-dependent data form to enhance modulation robustness. Meanwhile, the Cascade Shift-Shuffle Spectral Transformer (CSST) with strong perception of the diffraction degeneration is designed to solve a sparsity-constrained inverse problem, realizing the volume reconstruction from 2D measurements with Large amount of aliasing. Our system is evaluated by elaborating the imaging optical theory and reconstruction algorithm with demonstrating the experimental imaging under a single exposure. Ultimately, we achieve the sub-super-pixel spatial resolution and high spectral resolution imaging. The code will be available at: https://github.com/Krito-ex/CSST.

**ABSTRACT**  
We propose a method for adapting neural networks to distribution shifts at test-time. In contrast to training-time robustness mechanisms that attempt to anticipate and counter the shift, we create a closed-loop system and make use of a test-time feedback signal to adapt a network on the fly. We show that this loop can be effectively implemented using a learning-based function, which realizes an amortized optimizer for the network. This leads to an adaptation method, named Rapid Network Adaptation (RNA), that is notably more flexible and orders of magnitude faster than the baselines. Through a broad set of experiments using various adaptation signals and target tasks, we study the efficiency and flexibility of this method. We perform the evaluations using various datasets (Taskonomy, Replica, ScanNet, Hypersim, COCO, ImageNet), tasks (depth, optical flow, semantic segmentation, classification), and distribution shifts (Cross-datasets, 2D and 3D Common Corruptions) with promising results. We end with a discussion on general formulations for handling distribution shifts and our observations from comparing with similar approaches from other domains.

**ABSTRACT**  
Vision Transformers (ViTs) have emerged as state-of-the-art models for various vision tasks recently. However, their heavy computation costs remain daunting for resource-limited devices. Consequently, researchers have dedicated themselves to compressing redundant information in ViTs for acceleration. However, they generally sparsely drop redundant image tokens by token pruning or brutally remove channels by channel pruning, leading to a sub-optimal balance between model performance and inference speed. They are also disadvantageous in transferring compressed models to downstream vision tasks that require the spatial structure of images, such as semantic segmentation. To tackle these issues, we propose a joint compression method for ViTs that offers both high accuracy and fast inference speed, while also maintaining favorable transferability to downstream tasks (CAIT). Specifically, we introduce an asymmetric token merging (ATME) strategy to effectively integrate neighboring tokens. It can successfully compress redundant token information while preserving the spatial structure of images. We further employ a consistent dynamic channel pruning (CDCP) strategy to dynamically prune unimportant channels in ViTs. Thanks to CDCP, insignificant channels in multi-head self-attention modules of ViTs can be pruned uniformly, greatly enhancing the model compression. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method can achieve state-of-the-art performance across various ViTs. For example, our pruned DeiT-Tiny and DeiT-Small achieve speedups of 1.7$\times$ and 1.9$\times$, respectively, without accuracy drops on ImageNet. On the ADE20k segmentation dataset, our method can enjoy up to 1.31$\times$ speedups with comparable mIoU. Our code will be publicly available.

**ABSTRACT**  
Limited data availability is a challenging problem in the latent fingerprint domain. Synthetically generated fingerprints are vital for training data-hungry neural network-based algorithms. Conventional methods distort clean fingerprints to generate synthetic latent fingerprints. We propose a simple and effective approach using style transfer and image blending to synthesize realistic latent fingerprints. Our evaluation criteria and experiments demonstrate that the generated synthetic latent fingerprints preserve the identity information from the input contact-based fingerprints while possessing similar characteristics as real latent fingerprints. Additionally, we show that the generated fingerprints exhibit several qualities and styles, suggesting that the proposed method can generate multiple samples from a single fingerprint.

**ABSTRACT**  
Decoding of seen visual contents with non-invasive brain recordings has important scientific and practical values. Efforts have been made to recover the seen images from brain signals. However, most existing approaches cannot faithfully reflect the visual contents due to insufficient image quality or semantic mismatches. Compared with reconstructing pixel-level visual images, speaking is a more efficient and effective way to explain visual information. Here we introduce a non-invasive neural decoder, termed as MindGPT, which interprets perceived visual stimuli into natural languages from fMRI signals. Specifically, our model builds upon a visually guided neural encoder with a cross-attention mechanism, which permits us to guide latent neural representations towards a desired language semantic direction in an end-to-end manner by the collaborative use of the large language model GPT. By doing so, we found that the neural representations of the MindGPT are explainable, which can be used to evaluate the contributions of visual properties to language semantics. Our experiments show that the generated word sequences truthfully represented the visual information (with essential details) conveyed in the seen stimuli. The results also suggested that with respect to language decoding tasks, the higher visual cortex (HVC) is more semantically informative than the lower visual cortex (LVC), and using only the HVC can recover most of the semantic information. The code of the MindGPT model will be publicly available at https://github.com/JxuanC/MindGPT.

**ABSTRACT**  
In the field of 3D scene understanding, 3D scene graphs have emerged as a new scene representation that combines geometric and semantic information about objects and their relationships. However, learning semantic 3D scene graphs in a fully supervised manner is inherently difficult as it requires not only object-level annotations but also relationship labels. While pre-training approaches have helped to boost the performance of many methods in various fields, pre-training for 3D scene graph prediction has received little attention. Furthermore, we find in this paper that classical contrastive point cloud-based pre-training approaches are ineffective for 3D scene graph learning. To this end, we present SGRec3D, a novel self-supervised pre-training method for 3D scene graph prediction. We propose to reconstruct the 3D input scene from a graph bottleneck as a pretext task. Pre-training SGRec3D does not require object relationship labels, making it possible to exploit large-scale 3D scene understanding datasets, which were off-limits for 3D scene graph learning before. Our experiments demonstrate that in contrast to recent point cloud-based pre-training approaches, our proposed pre-training improves the 3D scene graph prediction considerably, which results in SOTA performance, outperforming other 3D scene graph models by +10% on object prediction and +4% on relationship prediction. Additionally, we show that only using a small subset of 10% labeled data during fine-tuning is sufficient to outperform the same model without pre-training.

**ABSTRACT**  
There has been a recent emphasis on integrating physical models and deep neural networks (DNNs) for SAR target recognition, to improve performance and achieve a higher level of physical interpretability. The attributed scattering center (ASC) parameters garnered the most interest, being considered as additional input data or features for fusion in most methods. However, the performance greatly depends on the ASC optimization result, and the fusion strategy is not adaptable to different types of physical information. Meanwhile, the current evaluation scheme is inadequate to assess the model's robustness and generalizability. Thus, we propose a physics inspired hybrid attention (PIHA) mechanism and the once-for-all (OFA) evaluation protocol to address the above issues. PIHA leverages the high-level semantics of physical information to activate and guide the feature group aware of local semantics of target, so as to re-weight the feature importance based on knowledge prior. It is flexible and generally applicable to various physical models, and can be integrated into arbitrary DNNs without modifying the original architecture. The experiments involve a rigorous assessment using the proposed OFA, which entails training and validating a model on either sufficient or limited data and evaluating on multiple test sets with different data distributions. Our method outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches in 12 test scenarios with same ASC parameters. Moreover, we analyze the working mechanism of PIHA and evaluate various PIHA enabled DNNs. The experiments also show PIHA is effective for different physical information. The source code together with the adopted physical information is available at https://github.com/XAI4SAR.

**ABSTRACT**  
In recent years, static meshes with texture maps have become one of the most prevalent digital representations of 3D shapes in various applications, such as animation, gaming, medical imaging, and cultural heritage applications. However, little research has been done on the quality assessment of textured meshes, which hinders the development of quality-oriented applications, such as mesh compression and enhancement. In this paper, we create a large-scale textured mesh quality assessment database, namely SJTU-TMQA, which includes 21 reference meshes and 945 distorted samples. The meshes are rendered into processed video sequences and then conduct subjective experiments to obtain mean opinion scores (MOS). The diversity of content and accuracy of MOS has been shown to validate its heterogeneity and reliability. The impact of various types of distortion on human perception is demonstrated. 13 state-of-the-art objective metrics are evaluated on SJTU-TMQA. The results report the highest correlation of around 0.6, indicating the need for more effective objective metrics. The SJTU-TMQA is available at https://ccccby.github.io

**ABSTRACT**  
Large-scale text-to-image generative models have been a ground-breaking development in generative AI, with diffusion models showing their astounding ability to synthesize convincing images following an input text prompt. The goal of image editing research is to give users control over the generated images by modifying the text prompt. Current image editing techniques are susceptible to unintended modifications of regions outside the targeted area, such as on the background or on distractor objects which have some semantic or visual relationship with the targeted object. According to our experimental findings, inaccurate cross-attention maps are at the root of this problem. Based on this observation, we propose Dynamic Prompt Learning (DPL) to force cross-attention maps to focus on correct noun words in the text prompt. By updating the dynamic tokens for nouns in the textual input with the proposed leakage repairment losses, we achieve fine-grained image editing over particular objects while preventing undesired changes to other image regions. Our method DPL, based on the publicly available Stable Diffusion, is extensively evaluated on a wide range of images, and consistently obtains superior results both quantitatively (CLIP score, Structure-Dist) and qualitatively (on user-evaluation). We show improved prompt editing results for Word-Swap, Prompt Refinement, and Attention Re-weighting, especially for complex multi-object scenes.

**ABSTRACT**  
Previous approaches to detecting human anomalies in videos have typically relied on implicit modeling by directly applying the model to video or skeleton data, potentially resulting in inaccurate modeling of motion information. In this paper, we conduct an exploratory study and introduce a new idea called HKVAD (Human Kinematic-inspired Video Anomaly Detection) for video anomaly detection, which involves the explicit use of human kinematic features to detect anomalies. To validate the effectiveness and potential of this perspective, we propose a pilot method that leverages the kinematic features of the skeleton pose, with a specific focus on the walking stride, skeleton displacement at feet level, and neck level. Following this, the method employs a normalizing flow model to estimate density and detect anomalies based on the estimated density. Based on the number of kinematic features used, we have devised three straightforward variant methods and conducted experiments on two highly challenging public datasets, ShanghaiTech and UBnormal. Our method achieves good results with minimal computational resources, validating its effectiveness and potential.

**ABSTRACT**  
Bio-inspired neuromorphic cameras asynchronously record pixel brightness changes and generate sparse event streams. They can capture dynamic scenes with little motion blur and more details in extreme illumination conditions. Due to the multidimensional address-event structure, most existing vision algorithms cannot properly handle asynchronous event streams. While several event representations and processing methods have been developed to address such an issue, they are typically driven by a large number of events, leading to substantial overheads in runtime and memory. In this paper, we propose a new graph representation of the event data and couple it with a Graph Transformer to perform accurate neuromorphic classification. Extensive experiments show that our approach leads to better results and excels at the challenging realistic situations where only a small number of events and limited computational resources are available, paving the way for neuromorphic applications embedded into mobile facilities.

**ABSTRACT**  
To develop the next generation of intelligent LiDARs, we propose a novel framework of parallel LiDARs and construct a hardware prototype in our experimental platform, DAWN (Digital Artificial World for Natural). It emphasizes the tight integration of physical and digital space in LiDAR systems, with networking being one of its supported core features. In the context of autonomous driving, V2V (Vehicle-to-Vehicle) technology enables efficient information sharing between different agents which significantly promotes the development of LiDAR networks. However, current research operates under an ideal situation where all vehicles are equipped with identical LiDAR, ignoring the diversity of LiDAR categories and operating frequencies. In this paper, we first utilize OpenCDA and RLS (Realistic LiDAR Simulation) to construct a novel heterogeneous LiDAR dataset named OPV2V-HPL. Additionally, we present HPL-ViT, a pioneering architecture designed for robust feature fusion in heterogeneous and dynamic scenarios. It uses a graph-attention Transformer to extract domain-specific features for each agent, coupled with a cross-attention mechanism for the final fusion. Extensive experiments on OPV2V-HPL demonstrate that HPL-ViT achieves SOTA (state-of-the-art) performance in all settings and exhibits outstanding generalization capabilities.

**ABSTRACT**  
The high biological properties and low energy consumption of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have brought much attention in recent years. However, the converted SNNs generally need large time steps to achieve satisfactory performance, which will result in high inference latency and computational resources increase. In this work, we propose a highly efficient and fast SNN for object detection. First, we build an initial compact ANN by using quantization training method of convolution layer fold batch normalization layer and neural network modification. Second, we theoretically analyze how to obtain the low complexity SNN correctly. Then, we propose a scale-aware pseudoquantization scheme to guarantee the correctness of the compact ANN to SNN. Third, we propose a continuous inference scheme by using a Feed-Forward Integrate-and-Fire (FewdIF) neuron to realize high-speed object detection. Experimental results show that our efficient SNN can achieve 118X speedup on GPU with only 1.5MB parameters for object detection tasks. We further verify our SNN on FPGA platform and the proposed model can achieve 800+FPS object detection with extremely low latency.

**ABSTRACT**  
Spiking Neural Networks, as a third-generation neural network, are well-suited for edge AI applications due to their binary spike nature. However, when it comes to complex tasks like object detection, SNNs often require a substantial number of time steps to achieve high performance. This limitation significantly hampers the widespread adoption of SNNs in latency-sensitive edge devices. In this paper, our focus is on generating highly accurate and low-latency SNNs specifically for object detection. Firstly, we systematically derive the conversion between SNNs and ANNs and analyze how to improve the consistency between them: improving the spike firing rate and reducing the quantization error. Then we propose a structural replacement, quantization of ANN activation and residual fix to allevicate the disparity. We evaluate our method on challenging dataset MS COCO, PASCAL VOC and our spike dataset. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves higher accuracy and lower latency compared to previous work Spiking-YOLO. The advantages of SNNs processing of spike signals are also demonstrated.

This results in the release of LAION-EO, a dataset sourced from the web containing pairs of text and satellite images in high (pixel-wise) resolution.

**ABSTRACT**  
Facade parsing stands as a pivotal computer vision task with far-reaching applications in areas like architecture, urban planning, and energy efficiency. Despite the recent success of deep learning-based methods in yielding impressive results on certain open-source datasets, their viability for real-world applications remains uncertain. Real-world scenarios are considerably more intricate, demanding greater computational efficiency. Existing datasets often fall short in representing these settings, and previous methods frequently rely on extra models to enhance accuracy, which requires much computation cost. In this paper, we introduce Comprehensive Facade Parsing (CFP), a dataset meticulously designed to encompass the intricacies of real-world facade parsing tasks. Comprising a total of 602 high-resolution street-view images, this dataset captures a diverse array of challenging scenarios, including sloping angles and densely clustered buildings, with painstakingly curated annotations for each image. We introduce a new pipeline known as Revision-based Transformer Facade Parsing (RTFP). This marks the pioneering utilization of Vision Transformers (ViT) in facade parsing, and our experimental results definitively substantiate its merit. We also design Line Acquisition, Filtering, and Revision (LAFR), an efficient yet accurate revision algorithm that can improve the segment result solely from simple line detection using prior knowledge of the facade. In ECP 2011, RueMonge 2014, and our CFP, we evaluate the superiority of our method. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/wbw520/RTFP.

**ABSTRACT**  
We propose to replace vector quantization (VQ) in the latent representation of VQ-VAEs with a simple scheme termed finite scalar quantization (FSQ), where we project the VAE representation down to a few dimensions (typically less than 10). Each dimension is quantized to a small set of fixed values, leading to an (implicit) codebook given by the product of these sets. By appropriately choosing the number of dimensions and values each dimension can take, we obtain the same codebook size as in VQ. On top of such discrete representations, we can train the same models that have been trained on VQ-VAE representations. For example, autoregressive and masked transformer models for image generation, multimodal generation, and dense prediction computer vision tasks. Concretely, we employ FSQ with MaskGIT for image generation, and with UViM for depth estimation, colorization, and panoptic segmentation. Despite the much simpler design of FSQ, we obtain competitive performance in all these tasks. We emphasize that FSQ does not suffer from codebook collapse and does not need the complex machinery employed in VQ (commitment losses, codebook reseeding, code splitting, entropy penalties, etc.) to learn expressive discrete representations.

**ABSTRACT**  
Multimodal transfer learning aims to transform pretrained representations of diverse modalities into a common domain space for effective multimodal fusion. However, conventional systems are typically built on the assumption that all modalities exist, and the lack of modalities always leads to poor inference performance. Furthermore, extracting pretrained embeddings for all modalities is computationally inefficient for inference. In this work, to achieve high efficiency-performance multimodal transfer learning, we propose VideoAdviser, a video knowledge distillation method to transfer multimodal knowledge of video-enhanced prompts from a multimodal fundamental model (teacher) to a specific modal fundamental model (student). With an intuition that the best learning performance comes with professional advisers and smart students, we use a CLIP-based teacher model to provide expressive multimodal knowledge supervision signals to a RoBERTa-based student model via optimizing a step-distillation objective loss -- first step: the teacher distills multimodal knowledge of video-enhanced prompts from classification logits to a regression logit -- second step: the multimodal knowledge is distilled from the regression logit of the teacher to the student. We evaluate our method in two challenging multimodal tasks: video-level sentiment analysis (MOSI and MOSEI datasets) and audio-visual retrieval (VEGAS dataset). The student (requiring only the text modality as input) achieves an MAE score improvement of up to 12.3% for MOSI and MOSEI. Our method further enhances the state-of-the-art method by 3.4% mAP score for VEGAS without additional computations for inference. These results suggest the strengths of our method for achieving high efficiency-performance multimodal transfer learning.

**ABSTRACT**  
Large language models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art results in many natural language processing tasks. They have also demonstrated ability to adapt well to different tasks through zero-shot or few-shot settings. With the capability of these LLMs, researchers have looked into how to adopt them for use with Visual Question Answering (VQA). Many methods require further training to align the image and text embeddings. However, these methods are computationally expensive and requires large scale image-text dataset for training. In this paper, we explore a method of combining pretrained LLMs and other foundation models without further training to solve the VQA problem. The general idea is to use natural language to represent the images such that the LLM can understand the images. We explore different decoding strategies for generating textual representation of the image and evaluate their performance on the VQAv2 dataset.

**ABSTRACT**  
Contrastive learning has shown to learn better quality representations than models trained using cross-entropy loss. They also transfer better to downstream datasets from different domains. However, little work has been done to explore the transferability of representations learned using contrastive learning when trained on a multi-domain dataset. In this paper, a study has been conducted using the Supervised Contrastive Learning framework to learn representations from the multi-domain DomainNet dataset and then evaluate the transferability of the representations learned on other downstream datasets. The fixed feature linear evaluation protocol will be used to evaluate the transferability on 7 downstream datasets that were chosen across different domains. The results obtained are compared to a baseline model that was trained using the widely used cross-entropy loss. Empirical results from the experiments showed that on average, the Supervised Contrastive Learning model performed 6.05% better than the baseline model on the 7 downstream datasets. The findings suggest that Supervised Contrastive Learning models can potentially learn more robust representations that transfer better across domains than cross-entropy models when trained on a multi-domain dataset.

**ABSTRACT**  
Generic event boundary detection aims to localize the generic, taxonomy-free event boundaries that segment videos into chunks. Existing methods typically require video frames to be decoded before feeding into the network, which contains significant spatio-temporal redundancy and demands considerable computational power and storage space. To remedy these issues, we propose a novel compressed video representation learning method for event boundary detection that is fully end-to-end leveraging rich information in the compressed domain, i.e., RGB, motion vectors, residuals, and the internal group of pictures (GOP) structure, without fully decoding the video. Specifically, we use lightweight ConvNets to extract features of the P-frames in the GOPs and spatial-channel attention module (SCAM) is designed to refine the feature representations of the P-frames based on the compressed information with bidirectional information flow. To learn a suitable representation for boundary detection, we construct the local frames bag for each candidate frame and use the long short-term memory (LSTM) module to capture temporal relationships. We then compute frame differences with group similarities in the temporal domain. This module is only applied within a local window, which is critical for event boundary detection. Finally a simple classifier is used to determine the event boundaries of video sequences based on the learned feature representation. To remedy the ambiguities of annotations and speed up the training process, we use the Gaussian kernel to preprocess the ground-truth event boundaries. Extensive experiments conducted on the Kinetics-GEBD and TAPOS datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves considerable improvements compared to previous end-to-end approach while running at the same speed.

**ABSTRACT**  
As a front-burner problem in incremental learning, class incremental semantic segmentation (CISS) is plagued by catastrophic forgetting and semantic drift. Although recent methods have utilized knowledge distillation to transfer knowledge from the old model, they are still unable to avoid pixel confusion, which results in severe misclassification after incremental steps due to the lack of annotations for past and future classes. Meanwhile data-replay-based approaches suffer from storage burdens and privacy concerns. In this paper, we propose to address CISS without exemplar memory and resolve catastrophic forgetting as well as semantic drift synchronously. We present Inherit with Distillation and Evolve with Contrast (IDEC), which consists of a Dense Knowledge Distillation on all Aspects (DADA) manner and an Asymmetric Region-wise Contrastive Learning (ARCL) module. Driven by the devised dynamic class-specific pseudo-labelling strategy, DADA distils intermediate-layer features and output-logits collaboratively with more emphasis on semantic-invariant knowledge inheritance. ARCL implements region-wise contrastive learning in the latent space to resolve semantic drift among known classes, current classes, and unknown classes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on multiple CISS tasks by state-of-the-art performance, including Pascal VOC 2012, ADE20K and ISPRS datasets. Our method also shows superior anti-forgetting ability, particularly in multi-step CISS tasks.

**ABSTRACT**  
In remote sensing imagery analysis, patch-based methods have limitations in capturing information beyond the sliding window. This shortcoming poses a significant challenge in processing complex and variable geo-objects, which results in semantic inconsistency in segmentation results. To address this challenge, we propose a dynamic scale perception framework, named GeoAgent, which adaptively captures appropriate scale context information outside the image patch based on the different geo-objects. In GeoAgent, each image patch's states are represented by a global thumbnail and a location mask. The global thumbnail provides context beyond the patch, and the location mask guides the perceived spatial relationships. The scale-selection actions are performed through a Scale Control Agent (SCA). A feature indexing module is proposed to enhance the ability of the agent to distinguish the current image patch's location. The action switches the patch scale and context branch of a dual-branch segmentation network that extracts and fuses the features of multi-scale patches. The GeoAgent adjusts the network parameters to perform the appropriate scale-selection action based on the reward received for the selected scale. The experimental results, using two publicly available datasets and our newly constructed dataset WUSU, demonstrate that GeoAgent outperforms previous segmentation methods, particularly for large-scale mapping applications.

**ABSTRACT**  
Designing a new clinical trial entails many decisions, such as defining a cohort and setting the study objectives to name a few, and therefore can benefit from recommendations based on exhaustive mining of past clinical trial records. Here, we propose a novel recommendation methodology, based on neural embeddings trained on a first-of-a-kind knowledge graph of clinical trials. We addressed several important research questions in this context, including designing a knowledge graph (KG) for clinical trial data, effectiveness of various KG embedding (KGE) methods for it, a novel inductive inference using KGE, and its use in generating recommendations for clinical trial design. We used publicly available data from clinicaltrials.gov for the study. Results show that our recommendations approach achieves relevance scores of 70%-83%, measured as the text similarity to actual clinical trial elements, and the most relevant recommendation can be found near the top of list. Our study also suggests potential improvement in training KGE using node semantics.

**ABSTRACT**  
Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms based on neural networks have been designed for decades with the goal of maximising some measure of accuracy. This has led to two undesired effects. First, model complexity has risen exponentially when measured in terms of computation and memory requirements. Second, state-of-the-art AI models are largely incapable of providing trustworthy measures of their uncertainty, possibly `hallucinating' their answers and discouraging their adoption for decision-making in sensitive applications.   With the goal of realising efficient and trustworthy AI, in this paper we highlight research directions at the intersection of hardware and software design that integrate physical insights into computational substrates, neuroscientific principles concerning efficient information processing, information-theoretic results on optimal uncertainty quantification, and communication-theoretic guidelines for distributed processing. Overall, the paper advocates for novel design methodologies that target not only accuracy but also uncertainty quantification, while leveraging emerging computing hardware architectures that move beyond the traditional von Neumann digital computing paradigm to embrace in-memory, neuromorphic, and quantum computing technologies. An important overarching principle of the proposed approach is to view the stochasticity inherent in the computational substrate and in the communication channels between processors as a resource to be leveraged for the purpose of representing and processing classical and quantum uncertainty.

**ABSTRACT**  
Job-shop scheduling problem (JSP) is a mathematical optimization problem widely used in industries like manufacturing, and flexible JSP (FJSP) is also a common variant. Since they are NP-hard, it is intractable to find the optimal solution for all cases within reasonable times. Thus, it becomes important to develop efficient heuristics to solve JSP/FJSP. A kind of method of solving scheduling problems is construction heuristics, which constructs scheduling solutions via heuristics. Recently, many methods for construction heuristics leverage deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with graph neural networks (GNN). In this paper, we propose a new approach, named residual scheduling, to solving JSP/FJSP. In this new approach, we remove irrelevant machines and jobs such as those finished, such that the states include the remaining (or relevant) machines and jobs only. Our experiments show that our approach reaches state-of-the-art (SOTA) among all known construction heuristics on most well-known open JSP and FJSP benchmarks. In addition, we also observe that even though our model is trained for scheduling problems of smaller sizes, our method still performs well for scheduling problems of large sizes. Interestingly in our experiments, our approach even reaches zero gap for 49 among 50 JSP instances whose job numbers are more than 150 on 20 machines.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this paper, we propose a new approach called Adaptive Behavioral Costs in Reinforcement Learning (ABC-RL) for training a human-like agent with competitive strength. While deep reinforcement learning agents have recently achieved superhuman performance in various video games, some of these unconstrained agents may exhibit actions, such as shaking and spinning, that are not typically observed in human behavior, resulting in peculiar gameplay experiences. To behave like humans and retain similar performance, ABC-RL augments behavioral limitations as cost signals in reinforcement learning with dynamically adjusted weights. Unlike traditional constrained policy optimization, we propose a new formulation that minimizes the behavioral costs subject to a constraint of the value function. By leveraging the augmented Lagrangian, our approach is an approximation of the Lagrangian adjustment, which handles the trade-off between the performance and the human-like behavior. Through experiments conducted on 3D games in DMLab-30 and Unity ML-Agents Toolkit, we demonstrate that ABC-RL achieves the same performance level while significantly reducing instances of shaking and spinning. These findings underscore the effectiveness of our proposed approach in promoting more natural and human-like behavior during gameplay.

**ABSTRACT**  
Understanding how children design and what they value in AI interfaces that allow them to explicitly train their models such as teachable machines, could help increase such activities' impact and guide the design of future technologies. In a co-design session using a modified storyboard, a team of 5 children (aged 7-13 years) and adult co-designers, engaged in AI problem formulation activities where they imagine their own teachable machines. Our findings, leveraging an established psychological value framework (the Rokeach Value Survey), illuminate how children conceptualize and embed their values in AI systems that they themselves devise to support their everyday activities. Specifically, we find that children's proposed ideas require advanced system intelligence, e.g. emotion detection and understanding the social relationships of a user. The underlying models could be trained under multiple modalities and any errors would be fixed by adding more data or by anticipating negative examples. Children's ideas showed they cared about family and expected machines to understand their social context before making decisions.

**ABSTRACT**  
Data storytelling is powerful for communicating data insights, but it requires diverse skills and considerable effort from human creators. Recent research has widely explored the potential for artificial intelligence (AI) to support and augment humans in data storytelling. However, there lacks a systematic review to understand data storytelling tools from the perspective of human-AI collaboration, which hinders researchers from reflecting on the existing collaborative tool designs that promote humans' and AI's advantages and mitigate their shortcomings. This paper investigated existing tools with a framework from two perspectives: the stages in the storytelling workflow where a tool serves, including analysis, planning, implementation, and communication, and the roles of humans and AI in each stage, such as creators, assistants, optimizers, and reviewers. Through our analysis, we recognize the common collaboration patterns in existing tools, summarize lessons learned from these patterns, and further illustrate research opportunities for human-AI collaboration in data storytelling.

**ABSTRACT**  
Artificial intelligence (AI) and software engineering (SE) are two important areas in computer science. In recent years, researchers are trying to apply AI techniques in various stages of software development to improve the overall quality of software products. Moreover, there are also some researchers focus on the intersection between SE and AI. In fact, the relationship between SE and AI is very weak; however, methods and techniques in one area have been adopted in another area. More and more software products are capable of performing intelligent behaviour like human beings. In this paper, two cases studies which are IBM Watson and Google AlphaGo that use different AI techniques in solving real world challenging problems have been analysed, evaluated and compared. Based on the analysis of both case studies, using AI techniques such as deep learning and machine learning in software systems contributes to intelligent systems. Watson adopts 'decision making support' strategy to help human make decisions; whereas AlphaGo uses 'self-decision making' to choose operations that contribute to the best outcome. In addition, Watson learns from man-made resources such as paper; AlphaGo, on the other hand, learns from massive online resources such as photos. AlphaGo uses neural networks and reinforcement learning to mimic human brain, which might be very useful in medical research for diagnosis and treatment. However, there is still a long way to go if we want to reproduce human brain in machine and view computers as thinkers, because human brain and machines are intrinsically different. It would be more promising to see whether computers and software systems will become more and more intelligent to help with real world challenging problems that human beings cannot do.

**ABSTRACT**  
Automated program repair (APR) using deep learning techniques has become an important area of research in recent years, aiming to automatically generate bug-fixing patches that can improve software reliability and maintainability. However, most existing methods either target a single language or require high computational resources to train multilingual models. In this paper, we propose T5APR, a novel neural program repair approach that provides a unified solution for bug fixing across multiple programming languages. T5APR leverages CodeT5, a powerful pre-trained text-to-text transformer model, and adopts a checkpoint ensemble strategy to improve patch recommendation. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on six well-known benchmarks in four programming languages (Java, Python, C, JavaScript), demonstrating T5APR's competitiveness against state-of-the-art techniques. T5APR correctly fixes 1,985 bugs, including 1,442 bugs that none of the compared techniques has fixed. We further support the effectiveness of our approach by conducting detailed analyses, such as comparing the correct patch ranking among different techniques. The findings of this study demonstrate the potential of T5APR for use in real-world applications and highlight the importance of multilingual approaches in the field of APR.

**ABSTRACT**  
Machine learning (ML) has the potential to revolutionize a wide range of research areas and industries, but many ML projects never progress past the proof-of-concept stage. To address this issue, we introduce Model Share AI (AIMS), an easy-to-use MLOps platform designed to streamline collaborative model development, model provenance tracking, and model deployment, as well as a host of other functions aiming to maximize the real-world impact of ML research. AIMS features collaborative project spaces and a standardized model evaluation process that ranks model submissions based on their performance on unseen evaluation data, enabling collaborative model development and crowd-sourcing. Model performance and various model metadata are automatically captured to facilitate provenance tracking and allow users to learn from and build on previous submissions. Additionally, AIMS allows users to deploy ML models built in Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow Keras, PyTorch, and ONNX into live REST APIs and automatically generated web apps with minimal code. The ability to deploy models with minimal effort and to make them accessible to non-technical end-users through web apps has the potential to make ML research more applicable to real-world challenges.

**ABSTRACT**  
Motivation: Technical debt is a metaphor that describes not-quite-right code introduced for short-term needs. Developers are aware of it and admit it in source code comments, which is called Self- Admitted Technical Debt (SATD). Therefore, SATD indicates weak code that developers are aware of. Problem statement: Inspecting source code is time-consuming; automatically inspecting source code for its vulnerabilities is a crucial aspect of developing software. It helps practitioners reduce the time-consuming process and focus on vulnerable aspects of the source code. Proposal: Accurately identify and better understand the semantics of self-admitted technical debt (SATD) by leveraging NLP and NL-PL approaches to detect vulnerabilities and the related SATD. Finally, a CI/CD pipeline will be proposed to make the vulnerability discovery process easily accessible to practitioners.

However, generating high-quality and reliable code remains a formidable task because of LLMs' lack of good programming practice, especially in exception handling. In this paper, we first conduct an empirical study and summarise three crucial challenges of LLMs in exception handling, i.e., incomplete exception handling, incorrect exception handling and abuse of try-catch. We then try prompts with different granularities to address such challenges, finding fine-grained knowledge-driven prompts works best. Based on our empirical study, we propose a novel Knowledge-driven Prompt Chaining-based code generation approach, name KPC, which decomposes code generation into an AI chain with iterative check-rewrite steps and chains fine-grained knowledge-driven prompts to assist LLMs in considering exception-handling specifications. We evaluate our KPC-based approach with 3,079 code generation tasks extracted from the Java official API documentation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the KPC-based approach has considerable potential to ameliorate the quality of code generated by LLMs. It achieves this through proficiently managing exceptions and obtaining remarkable enhancements of 109.86% and 578.57% with static evaluation methods, as well as a reduction of 18 runtime bugs in the sampled dataset with dynamic validation.

**ABSTRACT**  
Numerous code changes are made by developers in their daily work, and a superior representation of code changes is desired for effective code change analysis. Recently, Hoang et al. proposed CC2Vec, a neural network-based approach that learns a distributed representation of code changes to capture the semantic intent of the changes. Despite demonstrated effectiveness in multiple tasks, CC2Vec has several limitations: 1) it considers only coarse-grained information about code changes, and 2) it relies on log messages rather than the self-contained content of the code changes. In this work, we propose CCBERT (\underline{C}ode \underline{C}hange \underline{BERT}), a new Transformer-based pre-trained model that learns a generic representation of code changes based on a large-scale dataset containing massive unlabeled code changes. CCBERT is pre-trained on four proposed self-supervised objectives that are specialized for learning code change representations based on the contents of code changes. CCBERT perceives fine-grained code changes at the token level by learning from the old and new versions of the content, along with the edit actions. Our experiments demonstrate that CCBERT significantly outperforms CC2Vec or the state-of-the-art approaches of the downstream tasks by 7.7\%--14.0\% in terms of different metrics and tasks. CCBERT consistently outperforms large pre-trained code models, such as CodeBERT, while requiring 6--10$\times$ less training time, 5--30$\times$ less inference time, and 7.9$\times$ less GPU memory.

**ABSTRACT**  
The classic problem of exact subgraph matching returns those subgraphs in a large-scale data graph that are isomorphic to a given query graph, which has gained increasing importance in many real-world applications such as social network analysis, knowledge graph discovery in the Semantic Web, bibliographical network mining, and so on. In this paper, we propose a novel and effective graph neural network (GNN)-based path embedding framework (GNN-PE), which allows efficient exact subgraph matching without introducing false dismissals. Unlike traditional GNN-based graph embeddings that only produce approximate subgraph matching results, in this paper, we carefully devise GNN-based embeddings for paths, such that: if two paths (and 1-hop neighbors of vertices on them) have the subgraph relationship, their corresponding GNN-based embedding vectors will strictly follow the dominance relationship. With such a newly designed property of path dominance embeddings, we are able to propose effective pruning strategies based on path label/dominance embeddings and guarantee no false dismissals for subgraph matching. We build multidimensional indexes over path embedding vectors, and develop an efficient subgraph matching algorithm by traversing indexes over graph partitions in parallel and applying our pruning methods. We also propose a cost-model-based query plan that obtains query paths from the query graph with low query cost. Through extensive experiments, we confirm the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed GNN-PE approach for exact subgraph matching on both real and synthetic graph data.

**ABSTRACT**  
Subgraph counting is a fundamental problem in understanding and analyzing graph structured data, yet computationally challenging. This calls for an accurate and efficient algorithm for Subgraph Cardinality Estimation, which is to estimate the number of all isomorphic embeddings of a query graph in a data graph. We present FaSTest, a novel algorithm that combines (1) a powerful filtering technique to significantly reduce the sample space, (2) an adaptive tree sampling algorithm for accurate and efficient estimation, and (3) a worst-case optimal stratified graph sampling algorithm for difficult instances. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that FaSTest outperforms state-of-the-art sampling-based methods by up to two orders of magnitude and GNN-based methods by up to three orders of magnitude in terms of accuracy.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper proposes a novel approach to hedging portfolios of risky assets when financial markets are affected by financial turmoils. We introduce a completely novel approach to diversification activity not on the level of single assets but on the level of ensemble algorithmic investment strategies (AIS) built based on the prices of these assets. We employ four types of diverse theoretical models (LSTM - Long Short-Term Memory, ARIMA-GARCH - Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average - Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity, momentum, and contrarian) to generate price forecasts, which are then used to produce investment signals in single and complex AIS. In such a way, we are able to verify the diversification potential of different types of investment strategies consisting of various assets (energy commodities, precious metals, cryptocurrencies, or soft commodities) in hedging ensemble AIS built for equity indices (S&P 500 index). Empirical data used in this study cover the period between 2004 and 2022. Our main conclusion is that LSTM-based strategies outperform the other models and that the best diversifier for the AIS built for the S&P 500 index is the AIS built for Bitcoin. Finally, we test the LSTM model for a higher frequency of data (1 hour). We conclude that it outperforms the results obtained using daily data.

**ABSTRACT**  
We present a novel learned image reconstruction method for accelerated cardiac MRI with multiple receiver coils based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and algorithm unrolling. In contrast to many existing learned MR image reconstruction techniques that necessitate coil-sensitivity map (CSM) estimation as a distinct network component, our proposed approach avoids explicit CSM estimation. Instead, it implicitly captures and learns to exploit the inter-coil relationships of the images. Our method consists of a series of novel learned image and k-space blocks with shared latent information and adaptation to the acquisition parameters by feature-wise modulation (FiLM), as well as coil-wise data-consistency (DC) blocks.   Our method achieved PSNR values of 34.89 and 35.56 and SSIM values of 0.920 and 0.942 in the cine track and mapping track validation leaderboard of the MICCAI STACOM CMRxRecon Challenge, respectively, ranking 4th among different teams at the time of writing.

**ABSTRACT**  
Fusing multi-modal data can improve the performance of deep learning models. However, missing modalities are common for medical data due to patients' specificity, which is detrimental to the performance of multi-modal models in applications. Therefore, it is critical to adapt the models to missing modalities. This study aimed to develop an efficient multi-modal fusion architecture for medical data that was robust to missing modalities and further improved the performance on disease diagnosis.X-ray chest radiographs for the image modality, radiology reports for the text modality, and structured value data for the tabular data modality were fused in this study. Each modality pair was fused with a Transformer-based bi-modal fusion module, and the three bi-modal fusion modules were then combined into a tri-modal fusion framework. Additionally, multivariate loss functions were introduced into the training process to improve model's robustness to missing modalities in the inference process. Finally, we designed comparison and ablation experiments for validating the effectiveness of the fusion, the robustness to missing modalities and the enhancements from each key component. Experiments were conducted on MIMIC-IV, MIMIC-CXR with the 14-label disease diagnosis task. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) were used to evaluate models' performance. The experimental results demonstrated that our proposed multi-modal fusion architecture effectively fused three modalities and showed strong robustness to missing modalities. This method is hopeful to be scaled to more modalities to enhance the clinical practicality of the model.

**ABSTRACT**  
This study proposes a pipeline that incorporates a novel style transfer model and a simultaneous super-resolution and segmentation model. The proposed pipeline aims to enhance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) images by translating them into the late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) domain, which offers a larger amount of data with high-resolution and distinct highlighting of myocardium infarction (MI) areas. Subsequently, the segmentation task is performed on the LGE style image. An end-to-end super-resolution segmentation model is introduced to generate high-resolution mask from low-resolution LGE style DTI image. Further, to enhance the performance of the model, a multi-task self-supervised learning strategy is employed to pre-train the super-resolution segmentation model, allowing it to acquire more representative knowledge and improve its segmentation performance after fine-tuning. https: github.com/wlc2424762917/Med_Img

**ABSTRACT**  
Code is increasingly becoming a core data modality of modern machine learning research impacting not only the way we write code with conversational agents like OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Bard, or Anthropic's Claude, the way we translate code from one language into another, but also the compiler infrastructure underlying the language. While modeling approaches may vary and representations differ, the targeted tasks often remain the same within the individual classes of models. Relying solely on the ability of modern models to extract information from unstructured code does not take advantage of 70 years of programming language and compiler development by not utilizing the structure inherent to programs in the data collection. This detracts from the performance of models working over a tokenized representation of input code and precludes the use of these models in the compiler itself. To work towards the first intermediate representation (IR) based models, we fully utilize the LLVM compiler infrastructure, shared by a number of languages, to generate a 182B token dataset of LLVM IR. We generated this dataset from programming languages built on the shared LLVM infrastructure, including Rust, Swift, Julia, and C/C++, by hooking into LLVM code generation either through the language's package manager or the compiler directly to extract the dataset of intermediate representations from production grade programs. Statistical analysis proves the utility of our dataset not only for large language model training, but also for the introspection into the code generation process itself with the dataset showing great promise for machine-learned compiler components.

**ABSTRACT**  
Advancing our understanding of climate processes in regions characterized by intricate terrain complexity is a paramount challenge in contemporary climate science, particularly in the context of global climate change. Notably, the scarcity of observational data in these regions has imposed substantial limitations on understanding the nuanced climate dynamics therein. For the first time, utilizing cutting-edge AI-driven knowledge discovery techniques, we have uncovered explicit equations that elucidate the intricate relationship between terrain features and precipitation patterns, illuminating the previously concealed complexities governing these relationships. These equations, thus far undisclosed, exhibit remarkable accuracy compared to conventional empirical models when applied to precipitation data. Building on this foundation, we reveal a phenomenon known as the '1995 turning point,' indicating a significant shift in the terrain-precipitation relationship in approximately 1995, related to the forces of climate change. These equations have practical applications, particularly in achieving fine-scale downscaling precipitation predictions from low-resolution future climate data. This capability provides invaluable insights into the expected changes in precipitation patterns across diverse terrains under future climate scenarios.
