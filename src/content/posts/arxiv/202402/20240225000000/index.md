**ABSTRACT**  
Email continues to be a pivotal and extensively utilized communication medium within professional and commercial domains. Nonetheless, the prevalence of spam emails poses a significant challenge for users, disrupting their daily routines and diminishing productivity. Consequently, accurately identifying and filtering spam based on content has become crucial for cybersecurity. Recent advancements in natural language processing, particularly with <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> like <b>ChatGPT,</b> have shown remarkable performance in tasks such as <b>question</b> <b>answering</b> and <b>text</b> <b>generation.</b> However, its potential in spam identification remains underexplored. To fill in the gap, this study attempts to evaluate <b>ChatGPT's</b> capabilities for spam identification in both English and Chinese email datasets. We employ <b>ChatGPT</b> for spam email detection using <b>in-context</b> <b>learning,</b> which requires a <b>prompt</b> instruction and a few demonstrations. We also investigate how the training example size affects the performance of <b>ChatGPT.</b> For comparison, we also implement five popular <b>benchmark</b> methods, including naive Bayes, support vector machines (SVM), <b>logistic</b> <b>regression</b> (LR), feedforward dense neural networks (DNN), and <b>BERT</b> classifiers. Though extensive experiments, the performance of <b>ChatGPT</b> is significantly worse than deep <b>supervised</b> <b>learning</b> methods in the <b>large</b> <b>English</b> <b>dataset,</b> while it presents superior performance on the <b>low-resourced</b> Chinese dataset, even outperforming <b>BERT</b> in this case.

**ABSTRACT**  
This study explores the realm of <b>knowledge-base</b> <b>question</b> <b>answering</b> <b>(KBQA).</b> <b>KBQA</b> is considered a challenging task, particularly in parsing intricate <b>questions</b> <b>into</b> executable logical forms. Traditional <b>semantic</b> <b>parsing</b> (SP)-based methods require extensive data annotations, which result in significant costs. Recently, the advent of <b>few-shot</b> <b>in-context</b> <b>learning,</b> powered by <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> <b>(LLMs),</b> has showcased promising capabilities. Yet, fully leveraging <b>LLMs</b> to parse <b>questions</b> <b>into</b> logical forms in <b>low-resource</b> scenarios poses a substantial challenge. To tackle these hurdles, we introduce Interactive-KBQA, a framework designed to generate logical forms through direct interaction with <b>knowledge</b> <b>bases</b> <b>(KBs).</b> <b>Within</b> this framework, we have developed three generic APIs for KB interaction. For each category of complex <b>question,</b> <b>we</b> devised exemplars to guide <b>LLMs</b> through the <b>reasoning</b> processes. Our method achieves competitive results on the WebQuestionsSP, ComplexWebQuestions, KQA Pro, and MetaQA datasets with a minimal number of examples (shots). Importantly, our approach supports manual intervention, allowing for the iterative refinement of <b>LLM</b> outputs. By annotating a dataset with step-wise <b>reasoning</b> processes, we showcase our model's adaptability and highlight its potential for contributing significant enhancements to the field.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> <b>(LLMs)</b> have made significant progress in <b>machine</b> <b>translation</b> <b>(MT).</b> However, their potential in <b>domain-specific</b> <b>MT</b> remains under-explored. Current <b>LLM-based</b> <b>MT</b> systems still face several challenges. First, for <b>LLMs</b> with <b>in-context</b> <b>learning,</b> their effectiveness is highly sensitive to input translation examples, and processing them can increase inference costs. They often require extra post-processing due to over-generation. Second, <b>LLMs</b> with <b>fine-tuning</b> on <b>domain-specific</b> <b>data</b> often require high training costs for <b>domain</b> <b>adaptation,</b> and may weaken the <b>zero-shot</b> <b>MT</b> capabilities of <b>LLMs</b> due to over-specialization. The aforementioned methods can struggle to translate rare words in <b>domain</b> <b>transfer</b> scenarios. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a <b>prompt-oriented</b> <b>fine-tuning</b> method, denoted as LlamaIT, to effectively and efficiently <b>fine-tune</b> a general-purpose <b>LLM</b> for <b>domain-specific</b> <b>MT</b> tasks. First, we construct a task-specific mix-domain dataset, which is then used to <b>fine-tune</b> the <b>LLM</b> with LoRA. This can eliminate the need for input translation examples, post-processing, or over-specialization. By <b>zero-shot</b> <b>prompting</b> with instructions, we adapt the <b>MT</b> tasks to the target <b>domain</b> <b>at</b> inference time. To further elicit the <b>MT</b> capability for rare words, we construct new <b>prompts</b> by incorporating <b>domain-specific</b> <b>bilingual</b> vocabulary. We also conduct extensive experiments on both publicly available and self-constructed datasets. The results show that our LlamaIT can significantly enhance the <b>domain-specific</b> <b>MT</b> capabilities of the <b>LLM,</b> meanwhile preserving its <b>zero-shot</b> <b>MT</b> capabilities.

**ABSTRACT**  
The predominance of English and Latin-based <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> <b>(LLMs)</b> has led to a notable deficit in native Arabic <b>LLMs.</b> This discrepancy is accentuated by the prevalent inclusion of English tokens in existing Arabic models, detracting from their efficacy in processing native Arabic's intricate morphology and syntax. Consequently, there is a theoretical and practical imperative for developing <b>LLMs</b> predominantly focused on Arabic linguistic elements. To address this gap, this paper proposes ArabianGPT, a series of <b>transformer-based</b> models within the ArabianLLM suite designed explicitly for Arabic. These models, including ArabianGPT-0.1B and ArabianGPT-0.3B, vary in size and complexity, aligning with the nuanced linguistic characteristics of Arabic. The AraNizer tokenizer, integral to these models, addresses the unique morphological aspects of Arabic script, ensuring more accurate text processing. Empirical results from <b>fine-tuning</b> the models on tasks like <b>sentiment</b> <b>analysis</b> and <b>summarization</b> demonstrate significant improvements. For <b>sentiment</b> <b>analysis,</b> the <b>fine-tuned</b> ArabianGPT-0.1B model achieved a remarkable accuracy of 95%, a substantial increase from the base model's 56%. Similarly, in <b>summarization</b> tasks, <b>fine-tuned</b> models showed enhanced F1 scores, indicating improved precision and recall in generating concise summaries. Comparative analysis of <b>fine-tuned</b> ArabianGPT models against their base versions across various <b>benchmarks</b> reveals nuanced differences in performance, with <b>fine-tuning</b> positively impacting specific tasks like <b>question</b> <b>answering</b> and <b>summarization.</b> These findings underscore the efficacy of <b>fine-tuning</b> in aligning ArabianGPT models more closely with specific NLP tasks, highlighting the potential of tailored <b>transformer</b> architectures in advancing Arabic NLP.

**ABSTRACT**  
One of the most important yet onerous tasks in the academic peer-reviewing process is composing meta-reviews, which involves understanding the core contributions, strengths, and weaknesses of a scholarly manuscript based on peer-review narratives from multiple experts and then summarizing those multiple experts' perspectives into a concise holistic overview. Given the latest major developments in <b>generative</b> <b>AI,</b> especially <b>Large</b> <b>Language</b> <b>Models</b> <b>(LLMs),</b> it is very compelling to rigorously study the utility of <b>LLMs</b> in generating such meta-reviews in an academic peer-review setting. In this paper, we perform a case study with three popular <b>LLMs,</b> i.e., <b>GPT-3.5,</b> LLaMA2, and PaLM2, to automatically generate meta-reviews by <b>prompting</b> them with different types/levels of <b>prompts</b> based on the recently proposed TELeR taxonomy. Finally, we perform a detailed qualitative study of the meta-reviews generated by the <b>LLMs</b> and <b>summarize</b> our findings and <b>recommendations</b> for <b>prompting</b> <b>LLMs</b> for this complex task.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recent approaches to improving the extraction of <b>text</b> <b>embeddings</b> from autoregressive <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> <b>(LLMs)</b> have largely focused on improvements to data, backbone <b>pretrained</b> <b>language</b> <b>models,</b> or improving task-differentiation via instructions. In this work, we address an architectural limitation of autoregressive models: token embeddings cannot contain information from tokens that appear later in the input. To address this limitation, we propose a simple approach, "echo embeddings," in which we repeat the input twice in context and extract embeddings from the second occurrence. We show that echo embeddings of early tokens can encode information about later tokens, allowing us to maximally leverage high-quality <b>LLMs</b> for embeddings. On the MTEB leaderboard, echo embeddings improve over classical embeddings by over 9% <b>zero-shot</b> and by around 0.7% when <b>fine-tuned.</b> Echo embeddings with a <b>Mistral-7B</b> model achieve state-of-the-art compared to prior open source models that do not leverage synthetic <b>fine-tuning</b> data.

**ABSTRACT**  
Patients often face difficulties in understanding their hospitalizations, while healthcare workers have limited resources to provide explanations. In this work, we investigate the potential of <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> to generate patient summaries based on doctors' notes and study the effect of training data on the faithfulness and quality of the generated summaries. To this end, we develop a rigorous labeling protocol for <b>hallucinations,</b> <b>and</b> have two medical experts annotate 100 real-world summaries and 100 generated summaries. We show that <b>fine-tuning</b> on <b>hallucination-free</b> <b>data</b> effectively reduces <b>hallucinations</b> <b>from</b> 2.60 to 1.55 per summary for <b>Llama</b> 2, while preserving relevant information. Although the effect is still present, it is much smaller for <b>GPT-4</b> when <b>prompted</b> with five examples (0.70 to 0.40). We also conduct a qualitative evaluation using <b>hallucination-free</b> <b>and</b> improved training data. <b>GPT-4</b> shows very good results even in the <b>zero-shot</b> setting. We find that common quantitative metrics do not correlate well with faithfulness and quality. Finally, we test <b>GPT-4</b> for automatic <b>hallucination</b> <b>detection,</b> which yields promising results.

**ABSTRACT**  
Decoder-based <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> <b>(LLMs)</b> have shown high performance on many tasks in <b>natural</b> <b>language</b> <b>processing.</b> This is also true for <b>sentence</b> <b>embedding</b> learning, where a decoder-based model, PromptEOL, has achieved the best performance on semantic textual similarity (STS) tasks. However, PromptEOL makes great use of <b>fine-tuning</b> with a manually annotated <b>natural</b> <b>language</b> <b>inference</b> <b>(NLI)</b> dataset. We aim to improve <b>sentence</b> <b>embeddings</b> learned in an <b>unsupervised</b> setting by automatically generating an <b>NLI</b> dataset with an <b>LLM</b> and using it to <b>fine-tune</b> PromptEOL. In experiments on STS tasks, the proposed method achieved an average Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of 82.21 with respect to human evaluation, thus outperforming existing methods without using <b>large,</b> <b>manually</b> <b>annotated</b> datasets.

**ABSTRACT**  
Abstractive <b>summarization</b> models often generate factually inconsistent content particularly when the parametric knowledge of the model conflicts with the knowledge in the input document. In this paper, we analyze the robustness of <b>fine-tuning</b> based <b>summarization</b> models to the knowledge conflict, which we call factual adaptiveness. We utilize <b>pre-trained</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> to construct evaluation sets and find that factual adaptiveness is not strongly correlated with factual consistency on original datasets. Furthermore, we introduce a controllable <b>counterfactual</b> <b>data</b> <b>augmentation</b> method where the degree of knowledge conflict within the augmented <b>data</b> <b>can</b> be adjustable. Our experimental results on two <b>pre-trained</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> (PEGASUS and <b>BART)</b> and two <b>fine-tuning</b> datasets (XSum and CNN/DailyMail) demonstrate that our method enhances factual adaptiveness while achieving factual consistency on original datasets on par with the <b>contrastive</b> <b>learning</b> baseline.

**ABSTRACT**  
State-of-the-art neural retrievers predominantly focus on <b>high-resource</b> languages like English, which impedes their adoption in retrieval scenarios involving other languages. Current approaches circumvent the lack of high-quality labeled data in non-English languages by leveraging multilingual <b>pretrained</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> capable of cross-lingual transfer. However, these models require substantial task-specific <b>fine-tuning</b> across multiple languages, often perform poorly in languages with minimal representation in the pretraining corpus, and struggle to incorporate new languages after the pretraining phase. In this work, we present a novel modular <b>dense</b> <b>retrieval</b> model that learns from the rich data of a single <b>high-resource</b> language and effectively <b>zero-shot</b> transfers to a wide array of languages, thereby eliminating the need for language-specific labeled data. Our model, ColBERT-XM, demonstrates competitive performance against existing state-of-the-art multilingual retrievers trained on more extensive datasets in various languages. Further analysis reveals that our modular approach is highly data-efficient, effectively adapts to <b>out-of-distribution</b> data, and significantly reduces energy consumption and carbon emissions. By demonstrating its proficiency in <b>zero-shot</b> scenarios, ColBERT-XM marks a shift towards more sustainable and inclusive retrieval systems, enabling effective <b>information</b> <b>accessibility</b> in numerous languages. We publicly release our code and models for the community.

**ABSTRACT**  
Modern generative search engines enhance the reliability of <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>model</b> <b>(LLM)</b> responses by providing cited evidence. However, evaluating the answer's attribution, i.e., whether every claim within the generated responses is fully supported by its cited evidence, remains an open problem. This verification, traditionally dependent on costly human evaluation, underscores the urgent need for automatic attribution evaluation methods. To bridge the gap in the absence of standardized <b>benchmarks</b> for these methods, we present AttributionBench, a comprehensive <b>benchmark</b> compiled from various existing attribution datasets. Our extensive experiments on AttributionBench reveal the challenges of automatic attribution evaluation, even for state-of-the-art <b>LLMs.</b> Specifically, our findings show that even a <b>fine-tuned</b> <b>GPT-3.5</b> only achieves around 80% macro-F1 under a binary classification formulation. A detailed analysis of more than 300 error cases indicates that a majority of failures stem from the model's inability to process nuanced information, and the discrepancy between the information the model has access to and that human annotators do.

**ABSTRACT**  
Conceptual spaces represent entities in terms of their primitive semantic features. Such representations are highly valuable but they are notoriously difficult to learn, especially when it comes to modelling perceptual and subjective features. <b>Distilling</b> conceptual spaces from <b>Large</b> <b>Language</b> <b>Models</b> <b>(LLMs)</b> has recently emerged as a promising strategy. However, existing work has been limited to probing pre-trained <b>LLMs</b> using relatively simple <b>zero-shot</b> strategies. We focus in particular on the task of ranking entities according to a given conceptual space dimension. Unfortunately, we cannot directly <b>fine-tune</b> <b>LLMs</b> on this task, because ground truth rankings for conceptual space dimensions are rare. We therefore use more readily available features as training data and analyse whether the ranking capabilities of the resulting models transfer to perceptual and subjective features. We find that this is indeed the case, to some extent, but having perceptual and subjective features in the training data seems essential for achieving the best results. We furthermore find that pointwise ranking strategies are competitive against pairwise approaches, in defiance of common wisdom.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this study, we tackle a growing concern around the safety and ethical use of <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> <b>(LLMs).</b> Despite their potential, these models can be tricked into producing harmful or unethical content through various sophisticated methods, including 'jailbreaking' techniques and targeted manipulation. Our work zeroes in on a specific issue: to what extent <b>LLMs</b> can be led astray by asking them to generate responses that are instruction-centric such as a pseudocode, a program or a software snippet as opposed to vanilla text. To investigate this question, we introduce TechHazardQA, a dataset containing complex queries which should be answered in both text and instruction-centric formats (e.g., pseudocodes), aimed at identifying triggers for unethical responses. We query a series of <b>LLMs</b> -- <b>Llama-2-13b,</b> <b>Llama-2-7b,</b> <b>Mistral-V2</b> and <b>Mistral</b> 8X7B -- and ask them to generate both text and instruction-centric responses. For evaluation we report the harmfulness score metric as well as judgements from <b>GPT-4</b> and humans. Overall, we observe that asking <b>LLMs</b> to produce instruction-centric responses enhances the unethical response generation by ~2-38% across the models. As an additional objective, we investigate the impact of model editing using the ROME technique, which further increases the propensity for generating undesirable content. In particular, asking edited <b>LLMs</b> to generate instruction-centric responses further increases the unethical response generation by ~3-16% across the different models.

**ABSTRACT**  
Generally, the decoder-only <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> <b>(LLMs)</b> are adapted to context-aware <b>neural</b> <b>machine</b> <b>translation</b> <b>(NMT)</b> in a concatenating way, where <b>LLMs</b> take the concatenation of the source sentence (i.e., intra-sentence context) and the inter-sentence context as the input, and then to generate the target tokens sequentially. This adaptation strategy, i.e., concatenation mode, considers intra-sentence and inter-sentence contexts with the same priority, despite an apparent difference between the two kinds of contexts. In this paper, we propose an alternative adaptation approach, named Decoding-enhanced Multi-phase <b>Prompt</b> Tuning (DeMPT), to make <b>LLMs</b> discriminately model and utilize the inter- and intra-sentence context and more effectively adapt <b>LLMs</b> to context-aware <b>NMT.</b> First, DeMPT divides the context-aware <b>NMT</b> process into three separate phases. During each phase, different continuous <b>prompts</b> are introduced to make <b>LLMs</b> discriminately model various information. Second, DeMPT employs a heuristic way to further discriminately enhance the utilization of the source-side inter- and intra-sentence information at the final decoding phase. Experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms the concatenation method, and further improves the performance of <b>LLMs</b> in discourse modeling.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Unsupervised</b> <b>sentence</b> <b>embeddings</b> task aims to convert <b>sentences</b> <b>to</b> semantic vector representations. Most previous works directly use the <b>sentence</b> <b>representations</b> derived from <b>pretrained</b> <b>language</b> <b>models.</b> However, due to the token bias in <b>pretrained</b> <b>language</b> <b>models,</b> the models can not capture the fine-grained semantics in <b>sentences,</b> <b>which</b> leads to poor predictions. To address this issue, we propose a novel Self-Adaptive <b>Reconstruction</b> <b>Contrastive</b> <b>Sentence</b> <b>Embeddings</b> (SARCSE) framework, which reconstructs all tokens in <b>sentences</b> <b>with</b> an <b>AutoEncoder</b> to help the model to preserve more fine-grained semantics during tokens aggregating. In addition, we proposed a self-adaptive <b>reconstruction</b> <b>loss</b> to alleviate the token bias towards frequency. Experimental results show that SARCSE gains significant improvements compared with the strong baseline SimCSE on the 7 STS tasks.

**ABSTRACT**  
Parameter-efficient <b>fine-tuning</b> (PEFT) has emerged as an effective method for adapting <b>pre-trained</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> to various tasks efficiently. Recently, there has been a growing interest in transferring knowledge from one or multiple tasks to the downstream target task to achieve performance improvements. However, current approaches typically either train adapters on individual tasks or <b>distill</b> shared knowledge from source tasks, failing to fully exploit task-specific knowledge and the correlation between source and target tasks. To overcome these limitations, we propose PEMT, a novel parameter-efficient <b>fine-tuning</b> framework based on multi-task <b>transfer</b> <b>learning.</b> PEMT extends the mixture-of-experts (MoE) framework to capture the transferable knowledge as a weighted combination of adapters trained on source tasks. These weights are determined by a <b>gated</b> unit, measuring the correlation between the target and each source task using task description <b>prompt</b> vectors. To fully exploit the task-specific knowledge, we also propose the Task Sparsity Loss to improve the sparsity of the <b>gated</b> unit. We conduct experiments on a broad range of tasks over 17 datasets. The experimental results demonstrate our PEMT yields stable improvements over full <b>fine-tuning,</b> and state-of-the-art PEFT and knowledge transferring methods on various tasks. The results highlight the effectiveness of our method which is capable of sufficiently exploiting the knowledge and correlation features across multiple tasks.

**ABSTRACT**  
Aspect <b>Sentiment</b> <b>Triple</b> Extraction (ASTE) is an emerging task in fine-grained <b>sentiment</b> <b>analysis.</b> Recent studies have employed <b>Graph</b> <b>Neural</b> <b>Networks</b> <b>(GNN)</b> to model the syntax-semantic relationships inherent in triplet elements. However, they have yet to fully tap into the vast potential of syntactic and semantic information within the ASTE task. In this work, we propose a \emph{Dual Encoder: Exploiting the potential of Syntactic and Semantic} model (D2E2S), which maximizes the syntactic and semantic relationships among words. Specifically, our model utilizes a dual-channel encoder with a <b>BERT</b> channel to capture semantic information, and an enhanced <b>LSTM</b> channel for comprehensive syntactic information capture. Subsequently, we introduce the heterogeneous feature interaction module to capture intricate interactions between dependency syntax and attention semantics, and to dynamically select vital nodes. We leverage the synergy of these modules to harness the significant potential of syntactic and semantic information in ASTE tasks. Testing on public <b>benchmarks,</b> our D2E2S model surpasses the current state-of-the-art(SOTA), demonstrating its effectiveness.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>In-context</b> <b>learning</b> has become a popular paradigm in natural language processing. However, its performance can be significantly influenced by the order of <b>in-context</b> <b>demonstration</b> examples. In this paper, we found that causal language models (CausalLMs) are more sensitive to this order compared to prefix language models (PrefixLMs). We attribute this phenomenon to the auto-regressive attention masks within CausalLMs, which restrict each token from accessing information from subsequent tokens. This results in different receptive fields for samples at different positions, thereby leading to representation disparities across positions. To tackle this challenge, we introduce an <b>unsupervised</b> <b>fine-tuning</b> method, termed the Information-Augmented and Consistency-Enhanced approach. This approach utilizes <b>contrastive</b> <b>learning</b> to align representations of <b>in-context</b> <b>examples</b> across different positions and introduces a consistency loss to ensure similar representations for inputs with different permutations. This enhances the model's predictive consistency across permutations. Experimental results on four <b>benchmarks</b> suggest that our proposed method can reduce the sensitivity to the order of <b>in-context</b> <b>examples</b> and exhibit robust generalizability, particularly when demonstrations are sourced from a pool different from that used in the training phase, or when the number of <b>in-context</b> <b>examples</b> differs from what is used during training.

**ABSTRACT**  
Causal <b>graph</b> recovery is essential in the field of causal inference. Traditional methods are typically knowledge-based or statistical estimation-based, which are limited by data collection biases and individuals' knowledge about factors affecting the relations between variables of interests. The advance of <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> <b>(LLMs)</b> provides opportunities to address these problems. We propose a novel method that utilizes the extensive knowledge contained within a <b>large</b> <b>corpus</b> <b>of</b> scientific literature to deduce causal relationships in general causal <b>graph</b> recovery tasks. This method leverages <b>Retrieval</b> <b>Augmented-Generation</b> <b>(RAG)</b> based <b>LLMs</b> to systematically analyze and extract pertinent information from a comprehensive collection of research papers. Our method first retrieves relevant text chunks from the aggregated literature. Then, the <b>LLM</b> is tasked with identifying and labelling potential associations between factors. Finally, we give a method to aggregate the associational relationships to build a causal <b>graph.</b> We demonstrate our method is able to construct high quality causal <b>graphs</b> on the well-known SACHS dataset solely from literature.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Automatic</b> <b>evaluation</b> methods for <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> <b>(LLMs)</b> are hindered by data contamination, leading to inflated assessments of their effectiveness. Existing strategies, which aim to detect contaminated texts, focus on quantifying contamination status instead of accurately gauging model performance. In this paper, we introduce KIEval, a Knowledge-grounded Interactive Evaluation framework, which incorporates an <b>LLM-powered</b> "interactor" role for the first time to accomplish a dynamic contamination-resilient evaluation. Starting with a question in a conventional <b>LLM</b> <b>benchmark</b> involving domain-specific knowledge, KIEval utilizes dynamically generated, multi-round, and knowledge-focused dialogues to determine whether a model's response is merely a recall of <b>benchmark</b> answers or demonstrates a deep comprehension to apply knowledge in more complex conversations. Extensive experiments on seven leading <b>LLMs</b> across five datasets validate KIEval's effectiveness and generalization. We also reveal that data contamination brings no contribution or even negative effect to models' real-world applicability and understanding, and existing contamination detection methods for <b>LLMs</b> can only identify contamination in pre-training but not during <b>supervised</b> <b>fine-tuning.</b>

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Reinforcement</b> <b>Learning</b> <b>from</b> <b>Human</b> <b>Feedback</b> <b>(RLHF)</b> has become a dominating strategy in steering Language Models (LMs) towards human values/goals. The key to the strategy is employing a reward model ({$\varphi$}) which can reflect a latent reward model with humans. While this strategy has proven to be effective, the training methodology requires a lot of human preference annotation (usually of the order of tens of thousands) to train {$\varphi$}. Such large-scale preference annotations can be achievable if the reward model can be ubiquitously used. However, human values/goals are subjective and depend on the nature of the task. This poses a challenge in collecting diverse preferences for downstream applications. To address this, we propose a novel methodology to infuse domain knowledge into {$\varphi$}, which reduces the size of preference annotation required. We validate our approach in E-Commerce <b>Opinion</b> <b>Summarization,</b> with a significant reduction in dataset size (just $940$ samples) while advancing the state-of-the-art. Our contributions include a novel Reward Modelling technique, a new dataset (PromptOpinSumm) for <b>Opinion</b> <b>Summarization,</b> and a human preference dataset (OpinPref). The proposed methodology opens avenues for efficient <b>RLHF,</b> making it more adaptable to diverse applications with varying human values. We release the artifacts for usage under MIT License.

**ABSTRACT**  
Online hate detection suffers from biases incurred in data sampling, annotation, and model pre-training. Therefore, measuring the averaged performance over all examples in held-out test data is inadequate. Instead, we must identify specific model weaknesses and be informed when it is more likely to fail. A recent proposal in this direction is HateCheck, a suite for testing fine-grained model functionalities on synthesized data generated using templates of the kind "You are just a [slur] to me." However, despite enabling more detailed diagnostic insights, the HateCheck test cases are often generic and have simplistic sentence structures that do not match the real-world data. To address this limitation, we propose <b>GPT-HateCheck,</b> a framework to generate more diverse and realistic functional tests from scratch by instructing <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> <b>(LLMs).</b> We employ an additional <b>natural</b> <b>language</b> <b>inference</b> <b>(NLI)</b> model to verify the generations. Crowd-sourced annotation demonstrates that the generated test cases are of high quality. Using the new functional tests, we can uncover model weaknesses that would be overlooked using the original HateCheck dataset.

**ABSTRACT**  
Impressive results have been achieved in natural language processing (NLP) tasks through the training of <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> <b>(LLMs).</b> However, these models occasionally produce toxic content such as insults, threats, and profanity in response to certain <b>prompts,</b> thereby constraining their practical utility. To tackle this issue, various <b>finetuning-based</b> and decoding-based approaches have been utilized to mitigate toxicity. However, these methods typically necessitate additional costs such as high-quality training data or auxiliary models. In this paper, we propose fine-grained detoxification via instance-level prefixes (FGDILP) to mitigate toxic <b>text</b> <b>without</b> additional cost. Specifically, FGDILP contrasts the contextualized representation in attention space using a positive prefix-prepended <b>prompt</b> against multiple negative prefix-prepended <b>prompts</b> at the instance level. This allows for constructing fine-grained subtoxicity vectors, which enables collaborative detoxification by fusing them to correct the normal generation process when provided with a raw <b>prompt.</b> We validate that FGDILP enables controlled <b>text</b> <b>generation</b> with regard to toxicity at both the utterance and context levels. Our method surpasses <b>prompt-based</b> baselines in detoxification, although at a slight cost to generation fluency and diversity.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this paper, we investigate the interplay between attention heads and specialized "next-token" neurons in the Multilayer Perceptron that predict specific tokens. By <b>prompting</b> an <b>LLM</b> like <b>GPT-4</b> to explain these model internals, we can elucidate attention mechanisms that activate certain next-token neurons. Our analysis identifies attention heads that recognize contexts relevant to predicting a particular token, activating the associated neuron through the residual connection. We focus specifically on heads in earlier layers consistently activating the same next-token neuron across similar <b>prompts.</b> Exploring these differential activation patterns reveals that heads that specialize for distinct linguistic contexts are tied to generating certain tokens. Overall, our method combines neural explanations and probing isolated components to illuminate how attention enables context-dependent, specialized processing in <b>LLMs.</b>

**ABSTRACT**  
Entity Alignment (EA) is vital for integrating diverse <b>knowledge</b> <b>graph</b> <b>(KG)</b> data, playing a crucial role in data-driven AI applications. Traditional EA methods primarily rely on comparing entity embeddings, but their effectiveness is constrained by the limited input <b>KG</b> data and the capabilities of the <b>representation</b> <b>learning</b> techniques. Against this backdrop, we introduce ChatEA, an innovative framework that incorporates <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> <b>(LLMs)</b> to improve EA. To address the constraints of limited input <b>KG</b> data, ChatEA introduces a <b>KG-code</b> translation module that translates <b>KG</b> structures into a format understandable by <b>LLMs,</b> thereby allowing <b>LLMs</b> to utilize their extensive background <b>knowledge</b> <b>to</b> improve EA accuracy. To overcome the over-reliance on entity embedding comparisons, ChatEA implements a two-stage EA strategy that capitalizes on <b>LLMs'</b> capability for multi-step <b>reasoning</b> in a dialogue format, thereby enhancing accuracy while preserving efficiency. Our experimental results affirm ChatEA's superior performance, highlighting <b>LLMs'</b> potential in facilitating EA tasks.

**ABSTRACT**  
Theory of Mind (ToM) is the cognitive capability to perceive and ascribe mental states to oneself and others. Recent research has sparked a debate over whether <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> <b>(LLMs)</b> exhibit a form of ToM. However, existing ToM evaluations are hindered by challenges such as constrained scope, subjective judgment, and unintended contamination, yielding inadequate assessments. To address this gap, we introduce ToMBench with three key characteristics: a systematic evaluation framework encompassing 8 tasks and 31 abilities in social cognition, a multiple-choice question format to support automated and unbiased evaluation, and a build-from-scratch bilingual inventory to strictly avoid data leakage. Based on ToMBench, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the ToM performance of 10 popular <b>LLMs</b> across tasks and abilities. We find that even the most advanced <b>LLMs</b> like <b>GPT-4</b> lag behind human performance by over 10% points, indicating that <b>LLMs</b> have not achieved a human-level theory of mind yet. Our aim with ToMBench is to enable an efficient and effective evaluation of <b>LLMs'</b> ToM capabilities, thereby facilitating the development of <b>LLMs</b> with inherent social intelligence.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recent work has made a preliminary attempt to use <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> <b>(LLMs)</b> to solve the <b>stance</b> <b>detection</b> task, showing promising results. However, considering that <b>stance</b> <b>detection</b> usually requires detailed background knowledge, the vanilla <b>reasoning</b> method may neglect the domain knowledge to make a professional and accurate analysis. Thus, there is still room for improvement of <b>LLMs</b> <b>reasoning,</b> especially in leveraging the generation capability of <b>LLMs</b> to simulate specific experts (i.e., multi-agents) to detect the <b>stance.</b> <b>In</b> this paper, different from existing multi-agent works that require detailed descriptions and use fixed experts, we propose a Dynamic Experienced Expert Modeling (DEEM) method which can leverage the generated experienced experts and let <b>LLMs</b> reason in a semi-parametric way, making the experts more generalizable and reliable. Experimental results demonstrate that DEEM consistently achieves the best results on three standard <b>benchmarks,</b> outperforms methods with self-consistency <b>reasoning,</b> and reduces the bias of <b>LLMs.</b>

**ABSTRACT**  
Web agents powered by <b>Large</b> <b>Language</b> <b>Models</b> <b>(LLMs)</b> have demonstrated remarkable abilities in planning and executing multi-step interactions within complex web-based environments, fulfilling a wide range of web navigation tasks. Despite these advancements, the potential for <b>LLM-powered</b> agents to effectively engage with sequential user <b>instructions</b> <b>in</b> real-world scenarios has not been fully explored. In this work, we introduce a new task of Conversational Web Navigation, which necessitates sophisticated interactions that span multiple turns with both the users and the environment, supported by a specially developed dataset named Multi-Turn Mind2Web <b>(MT-Mind2Web).</b> To tackle the limited context length of <b>LLMs</b> and the context-dependency issue of the conversational tasks, we further propose a novel framework, named self-reflective memory-augmented planning (Self-MAP), which employs memory utilization and self-reflection techniques. Extensive experiments are conducted to <b>benchmark</b> the <b>MT-Mind2Web</b> dataset, and validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

**ABSTRACT**  
This work studies improving <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>model</b> <b>(LLM)</b> generations at inference time by mitigating fact-conflicting hallucinations. Particularly, we propose a self-endorsement framework that leverages the fine-grained fact-level comparisons across multiple sampled responses. Compared with prior ensemble methods (Wang et al., 2022;Chen et al., 2023)) that perform response-level selection, our approach can better alleviate hallucinations, especially for longform generation tasks. Our approach can broadly benefit smaller and open-source <b>LLMs</b> as it mainly conducts simple content-based comparisons. Experiments on Biographies show that our method can effectively improve the factuality of generations with simple and intuitive <b>prompts</b> across different scales of <b>LLMs.</b> Besides, comprehensive analyses on TriviaQA and GSM8K demonstrate the potential of self-endorsement for broader application.

**ABSTRACT**  
Prior work on <b>selective</b> <b>prediction</b> minimizes incorrect predictions from <b>vision-language</b> models (VLMs) by allowing them to abstain from answering when uncertain. However, when deploying a <b>vision-language</b> system with low tolerance for inaccurate predictions, <b>selective</b> <b>prediction</b> may be over-cautious and abstain too frequently, even on many correct predictions. We introduce ReCoVERR, an inference-time algorithm to reduce the over-abstention of a <b>selective</b> <b>vision-language</b> system without decreasing prediction accuracy. When the VLM makes a low-confidence prediction, instead of abstaining ReCoVERR tries to find relevant clues in the image that provide additional evidence for the prediction. ReCoVERR uses an <b>LLM</b> to pose related questions to the VLM, collects high-confidence evidences, and if enough evidence confirms the prediction the system makes a prediction instead of abstaining. ReCoVERR enables two VLMs, BLIP2 and InstructBLIP, to answer up to 20% more questions on the A-OKVQA task than vanilla <b>selective</b> <b>prediction</b> without decreasing system accuracy, thus improving overall system reliability.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Transformer-based</b> language models (LMs) track contextual information through large, hard-coded input windows. We introduce MemoryPrompt, a leaner approach in which the LM is complemented by a small auxiliary recurrent network that passes information to the LM by prefixing its regular input with a sequence of vectors, akin to soft <b>prompts,</b> without requiring LM <b>finetuning.</b> Tested on a task designed to probe a LM's ability to keep track of multiple fact updates, a MemoryPrompt-augmented LM outperforms much larger LMs that have access to the full input history. We also test MemoryPrompt on a long-distance dialogue dataset, where its performance is comparable to that of a model conditioned on the entire conversation history. In both experiments we also observe that, unlike full-finetuning approaches, MemoryPrompt does not suffer from catastrophic forgetting when adapted to new tasks, thus not disrupting the generalist capabilities of the underlying LM.

**ABSTRACT**  
Multi-level implicit discourse <b>relation</b> <b>recognition</b> (MIDRR) aims at identifying hierarchical discourse <b>relations</b> <b>among</b> arguments. Previous methods achieve the promotion through <b>fine-tuning</b> <b>PLMs.</b> However, due to the data scarcity and the task gap, the pre-trained feature space cannot be accurately tuned to the task-specific space, which even aggravates the collapse of the vanilla space. Besides, the comprehension of hierarchical semantics for MIDRR makes the conversion much harder. In this paper, we propose a <b>prompt-based</b> Parameter-Efficient Multi-level IDRR (PEMI) framework to solve the above problems. First, we leverage parameter-efficient <b>prompt</b> tuning to drive the inputted arguments to match the pre-trained space and realize the approximation with few parameters. Furthermore, we propose a hierarchical label refining (HLR) method for the <b>prompt</b> verbalizer to deeply integrate hierarchical guidance into the <b>prompt</b> tuning. Finally, our model achieves comparable results on PDTB 2.0 and 3.0 using about 0.1% trainable parameters compared with baselines and the visualization demonstrates the effectiveness of our HLR method.

**ABSTRACT**  
There is a growing need for <b>Large</b> <b>Language</b> <b>Models</b> <b>(LLMs)</b> to effectively use tools and external Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to plan and complete tasks. As such, there is tremendous interest in methods that can acquire sufficient quantities of train and test data that involve calls to tools / APIs. Two lines of research have emerged as the predominant strategies for addressing this challenge. The first has focused on synthetic data generation techniques, while the second has involved curating task-adjacent datasets which can be transformed into API / Tool-based tasks. In this paper, we focus on the task of identifying, curating, and transforming existing datasets and, in turn, introduce API-BLEND, a <b>large</b> <b>corpora</b> <b>for</b> training and systematic testing of tool-augmented <b>LLMs.</b> The datasets mimic real-world scenarios involving API-tasks such as API / tool detection, <b>slot</b> <b>filling,</b> and sequencing of the detected APIs. We demonstrate the utility of the API-BLEND dataset for both training and <b>benchmarking</b> purposes.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Aspect-Based</b> <b>Sentiment</b> <b>Analysis</b> (ABSA) stands as a crucial task in predicting the <b>sentiment</b> <b>polarity</b> associated with identified aspects within text. However, a notable challenge in ABSA lies in precisely determining the aspects' boundaries (start and end indices), especially for long ones, due to users' colloquial expressions. We propose DiffusionABSA, a novel <b>diffusion</b> <b>model</b> tailored for ABSA, which extracts the aspects progressively step by step. Particularly, DiffusionABSA gradually adds noise to the aspect terms in the training process, subsequently learning a denoising process that progressively restores these terms in a reverse manner. To estimate the boundaries, we design a denoising neural network enhanced by a syntax-aware temporal attention mechanism to chronologically capture the interplay between aspects and surrounding text. Empirical evaluations conducted on eight <b>benchmark</b> datasets underscore the compelling advantages offered by DiffusionABSA when compared against robust baseline models. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Qlb6x/DiffusionABSA.

**ABSTRACT**  
This study investigates the concept of the `right to be forgotten' within the context of <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> <b>(LLMs).</b> We explore <b>machine</b> <b>unlearning</b> as a pivotal solution, with a focus on pre-trained models--a notably under-researched area. Our research delineates a comprehensive framework for <b>machine</b> <b>unlearning</b> in pre-trained <b>LLMs,</b> encompassing a critical analysis of seven diverse unlearning methods. Through rigorous evaluation using curated datasets from arXiv, books, and GitHub, we establish a robust <b>benchmark</b> for unlearning performance, demonstrating that these methods are over $10^5$ times more computationally efficient than retraining. Our results show that integrating gradient ascent with gradient descent on in-distribution data improves hyperparameter robustness. We also provide detailed guidelines for efficient hyperparameter tuning in the unlearning process. Our findings advance the discourse on ethical AI practices, offering substantive insights into the mechanics of <b>machine</b> <b>unlearning</b> for pre-trained <b>LLMs</b> and underscoring the potential for responsible AI development.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper explores the challenges posed by aspect-based <b>sentiment</b> <b>classification</b> (ABSC) within <b>pretrained</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> <b>(PLMs),</b> with a particular focus on contextualization and hallucination issues. In order to tackle these challenges, we introduce CARBD-Ko (a Contextually Annotated Review <b>Benchmark</b> Dataset for Aspect-Based <b>Sentiment</b> <b>Classification</b> in Korean), a <b>benchmark</b> dataset that incorporates aspects and dual-tagged polarities to distinguish between aspect-specific and aspect-agnostic <b>sentiment</b> <b>classification.</b> The dataset consists of sentences annotated with specific aspects, aspect polarity, aspect-agnostic polarity, and the intensity of aspects. To address the issue of dual-tagged aspect polarities, we propose a novel approach employing a Siamese Network. Our experimental findings highlight the inherent difficulties in accurately predicting dual-polarities and underscore the significance of contextualized <b>sentiment</b> <b>analysis</b> models. The CARBD-Ko dataset serves as a valuable resource for future research endeavors in aspect-level <b>sentiment</b> <b>classification.</b>

**ABSTRACT**  
Most conventional <b>recommendation</b> methods (e.g., matrix factorization) represent user profiles as high-dimensional vectors. Unfortunately, these vectors lack interpretability and steerability, and often perform poorly in cold-start settings. To address these shortcomings, we explore the use of user profiles that are represented as human-readable text. We propose the Language-based Factorization Model (LFM), which is essentially an encoder/decoder model where both the encoder and the decoder are <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> <b>(LLMs).</b> The encoder <b>LLM</b> generates a compact natural-language profile of the user's interests from the user's rating history. The decoder <b>LLM</b> uses this summary profile to complete predictive downstream tasks. We evaluate our LFM approach on the MovieLens dataset, comparing it against matrix factorization and an <b>LLM</b> model that directly predicts from the user's rating history. In cold-start settings, we find that our method can have higher accuracy than matrix factorization. Furthermore, we find that generating a compact and human-readable summary often performs comparably with or better than direct <b>LLM</b> prediction, while enjoying better interpretability and shorter model input length. Our results motivate a number of future research directions and potential improvements.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this paper, alternating <b>weak</b> <b>triphone/BPE</b> alignment supervision is proposed to improve end-to-end model training. Towards this end, triphone and BPE alignments are extracted using a pre-existing hybrid <b>ASR</b> system. Then, regularization effect is obtained by cross-entropy based intermediate auxiliary losses computed on such alignments at a mid-layer representation of the encoder for triphone alignments and at the encoder for BPE alignments. <b>Weak</b> <b>supervision</b> is achieved through strong <b>label</b> <b>smoothing</b> with parameter of 0.5. Experimental results on TED-LIUM 2 indicate that either triphone or BPE alignment based <b>weak</b> <b>supervision</b> improves <b>ASR</b> performance over standard CTC auxiliary loss. Moreover, their combination lowers the word error rate further. We also investigate the alternation of the two auxiliary tasks during model training, and additional performance gain is observed. Overall, the proposed techniques result in over 10% relative error rate reduction over a CTC-regularized baseline system.

**ABSTRACT**  
The growing integration of <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> <b>(LLMs)</b> into social operations amplifies their impact on decisions in crucial areas such as economics, law, education, and healthcare, raising public concerns about these models' discrimination-related safety and reliability. However, prior discrimination measuring frameworks solely assess the average discriminatory behavior of <b>LLMs,</b> often proving inadequate due to the overlook of an additional discrimination-leading factor, i.e., the <b>LLMs'</b> prediction variation across diverse contexts. In this work, we present the Prejudice-Caprice Framework (PCF) that comprehensively measures discrimination in <b>LLMs</b> by considering both their consistently biased preference and preference variation across diverse contexts. Specifically, we mathematically dissect the aggregated contextualized discrimination risk of <b>LLMs</b> into prejudice risk, originating from <b>LLMs'</b> persistent prejudice, and caprice risk, <b>stemming</b> from their generation inconsistency. In addition, we utilize a data-mining approach to gather preference-detecting probes from sentence skeletons, devoid of attribute indications, to approximate <b>LLMs'</b> applied contexts. While initially intended for assessing discrimination in <b>LLMs,</b> our proposed PCF facilitates the comprehensive and flexible measurement of any inductive biases, including knowledge alongside prejudice, across various modality models. We apply our discrimination-measuring framework to 12 common <b>LLMs,</b> yielding intriguing findings: i) modern <b>LLMs</b> demonstrate significant pro-male stereotypes, ii) <b>LLMs'</b> exhibited discrimination correlates with several social and economic factors, iii) prejudice risk dominates the overall discrimination risk and follows a normal distribution, and iv) caprice risk contributes minimally to the overall risk but follows a fat-tailed distribution, suggesting that it is wild risk requiring enhanced surveillance.

**ABSTRACT**  
During task-oriented dialogues (TODs), human users naturally introduce chitchat that is beyond the immediate scope of the task, interfering with the flow of the conversation. To address this issue without the need for expensive manual data creation, we use <b>few-shot</b> <b>prompting</b> with <b>Llama-2-70B</b> to enhance the MultiWOZ dataset with user backstories, a typical example of chitchat interference in TODs. We assess the impact of this addition by testing two models: one trained solely on TODs and another trained on TODs with a preliminary chitchat interaction. Our analysis reveals that our enriched dataset poses a significant challenge to these systems. Moreover, we demonstrate that our dataset can be effectively used for training purposes, enabling a system to consistently acknowledge the user's backstory while also successfully moving the task forward in the same turn, as confirmed by human evaluation. These findings highlight the benefits of generating novel chitchat-TOD scenarios to test TOD systems more thoroughly and improve their resilience to natural user interferences.

**ABSTRACT**  
Despite the remarkable abilities of <b>Large</b> <b>Language</b> <b>Models</b> <b>(LLMs)</b> to answer questions, they often display a considerable level of overconfidence even when the question does not have a definitive answer. To avoid providing hallucinated answers to these unknown questions, existing studies typically investigate approaches to refusing to answer these questions. In this work, we propose a novel and scalable self-alignment method to utilize the <b>LLM</b> itself to enhance its response-ability to different types of unknown questions, being capable of not only refusing to answer but also providing explanation to the unanswerability of unknown questions. Specifically, the Self-Align method first employ a two-stage class-aware self-augmentation approach to generate a <b>large</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> unknown question-response data. Then we conduct disparity-driven self-curation to select qualified data for <b>fine-tuning</b> the <b>LLM</b> itself for aligning the responses to unknown questions as desired. Experimental results on two datasets across four types of unknown questions validate the superiority of the Self-Align method over existing baselines in terms of three types of task formulation.

**ABSTRACT**  
Although biomedical entity linking (BioEL) has made significant progress with <b>pre-trained</b> <b>language</b> <b>models,</b> challenges still exist for fine-grained and long-tailed entities. To address these challenges, we present BioELQA, a novel model that treats Biomedical Entity Linking as Multiple Choice <b>Question</b> <b>Answering.</b> BioELQA first obtains candidate entities with a fast retriever, jointly presents the mention and candidate entities to a generator, and then outputs the predicted symbol associated with its chosen entity. This formulation enables explicit comparison of different candidate entities, thus capturing fine-grained interactions between mentions and entities, as well as among entities themselves. To improve generalization for long-tailed entities, we retrieve similar labeled training instances as clues and concatenate the input with retrieved instances for the generator. Extensive experimental results show that BioELQA outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on several datasets.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Transformer-based</b> <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> <b>have</b> displayed impressive <b>in-context</b> <b>learning</b> capabilities, where a pre-trained <b>model</b> <b>can</b> handle new tasks without <b>fine-tuning</b> by simply augmenting the query with some input-output examples from that task. Despite the empirical success, the mechanics of how to train a <b>Transformer</b> to achieve <b>ICL</b> and the corresponding <b>ICL</b> capacity is mostly elusive due to the technical challenges of analyzing the nonconvex training problems resulting from the nonlinear <b>self-attention</b> and nonlinear activation in <b>Transformers.</b> To the best of our knowledge, this paper provides the first theoretical analysis of the training dynamics of <b>Transformers</b> with nonlinear <b>self-attention</b> and nonlinear MLP, together with the <b>ICL</b> generalization capability of the resulting <b>model.</b> <b>Focusing</b> on a group of binary classification tasks, we train <b>Transformers</b> using data from a subset of these tasks and quantify the impact of various factors on the <b>ICL</b> generalization performance on the remaining unseen tasks with and without data <b>distribution</b> <b>shifts.</b> We also analyze how different components in the learned <b>Transformers</b> contribute to the <b>ICL</b> performance. Furthermore, we provide the first theoretical analysis of how <b>model</b> <b>pruning</b> affects the <b>ICL</b> performance and prove that proper magnitude-based <b>pruning</b> can have a minimal impact on <b>ICL</b> while reducing inference costs. These theoretical findings are justified through numerical experiments.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Graph</b> <b>Structure</b> <b>Learning</b> (GSL) focuses on capturing intrinsic dependencies and interactions among nodes in <b>graph-structured</b> <b>data</b> <b>by</b> generating novel <b>graph</b> <b>structures.</b> <b>Graph</b> <b>Neural</b> <b>Networks</b> <b>(GNNs)</b> have emerged as promising GSL solutions, utilizing recursive message passing to encode node-wise inter-dependencies. However, many existing GSL methods heavily depend on explicit <b>graph</b> <b>structural</b> <b>information</b> as supervision signals, leaving them susceptible to challenges such as data noise and sparsity. In this work, we propose GraphEdit, an approach that leverages <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> <b>(LLMs)</b> to learn complex node relationships in <b>graph-structured</b> <b>data.</b> <b>By</b> enhancing the <b>reasoning</b> capabilities of <b>LLMs</b> through <b>instruction-tuning</b> <b>over</b> <b>graph</b> <b>structures,</b> <b>we</b> aim to overcome the limitations associated with explicit <b>graph</b> <b>structural</b> <b>information</b> and enhance the reliability of <b>graph</b> <b>structure</b> <b>learning.</b> Our approach not only effectively denoises noisy connections but also identifies node-wise dependencies from a global perspective, providing a comprehensive understanding of the <b>graph</b> <b>structure.</b> <b>We</b> conduct extensive experiments on multiple <b>benchmark</b> datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of GraphEdit across various settings.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Fine-tuning</b> <b>Large</b> <b>Language</b> <b>Models</b> <b>(LLMs)</b> is now a common approach for <b>text</b> <b>classification</b> in a wide range of applications. When labeled documents are scarce, <b>active</b> <b>learning</b> helps save annotation efforts but requires retraining of massive models on each acquisition iteration. We drastically expedite this process by using pretrained representations of <b>LLMs</b> within the <b>active</b> <b>learning</b> loop and, once the desired amount of labeled data is acquired, <b>fine-tuning</b> that or even a different pretrained <b>LLM</b> on this labeled data to achieve the best performance. As verified on common <b>text</b> <b>classification</b> <b>benchmarks</b> with pretrained <b>BERT</b> and <b>RoBERTa</b> as the backbone, our strategy yields similar performance to <b>fine-tuning</b> all the way through the <b>active</b> <b>learning</b> loop but is orders of magnitude less computationally expensive. The data acquired with our procedure generalizes across pretrained networks, allowing flexibility in choosing the final model or updating it as newer versions get released.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this study, we introduce a domain-decomposition-based distributed training and inference approach for <b>message-passing</b> neural networks (MPNN). Our objective is to address the challenge of scaling edge-based <b>graph</b> <b>neural</b> <b>networks</b> as the number of nodes increases. Through our distributed training approach, coupled with Nystr\"om-approximation sampling techniques, we present a scalable <b>graph</b> <b>neural</b> <b>network,</b> referred to as DS-MPNN (D and S standing for distributed and sampled, respectively), capable of scaling up to $O(10^5)$ nodes. We validate our sampling and distributed training approach on two cases: (a) a Darcy flow dataset and (b) steady RANS <b>simulations</b> of 2-D airfoils, providing comparisons with both single-GPU implementation and node-based <b>graph</b> <b>convolution</b> <b>networks</b> <b>(GCNs).</b> The DS-MPNN model demonstrates comparable accuracy to single-GPU implementation, can accommodate a significantly larger number of nodes compared to the single-GPU variant (S-MPNN), and significantly outperforms the node-based <b>GCN.</b>

**ABSTRACT**  
Parameter Efficient <b>Fine-Tuning</b> (PEFT) has gained significant attention for its ability to achieve competitive results while updating only a small subset of trainable parameters. Despite the promising performance of current PEFT methods, they present challenges in hyperparameter selection, such as determining the rank of LoRA or Adapter, or specifying the length of soft <b>prompts.</b> In addressing these challenges, we propose a novel approach to <b>fine-tuning</b> neural models, termed Representation EDiting (RED), which scales and biases the representation produced at each layer. RED substantially reduces the number of trainable parameters by a factor of $25,700$ compared to full parameter <b>fine-tuning,</b> and by a factor of $32$ compared to LoRA. Remarkably, RED achieves comparable or superior results to full parameter <b>fine-tuning</b> and other PEFT methods. Extensive experiments were conducted across models of varying architectures and scales, including <b>RoBERTa,</b> <b>GPT-2,</b> <b>T5,</b> and <b>Llama-2,</b> and the results demonstrate the efficiency and efficacy of RED, positioning it as a promising PEFT approach for large neural models.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Unsupervised</b> and <b>self-supervised</b> objectives, such as next token prediction, have enabled pre-training generalist models from large amounts of unlabeled data. In <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning</b> (RL), however, finding a truly general and scalable <b>unsupervised</b> pre-training objective for generalist policies from offline data remains a major open question. While a number of methods have been proposed to enable generic <b>self-supervised</b> RL, based on principles such as goal-conditioned RL, behavioral cloning, and <b>unsupervised</b> skill learning, such methods remain limited in terms of either the diversity of the discovered behaviors, the need for high-quality demonstration data, or the lack of a clear <b>prompting</b> or adaptation mechanism for downstream tasks. In this work, we propose a novel <b>unsupervised</b> framework to pre-train generalist policies that capture diverse, optimal, long-horizon behaviors from unlabeled offline data such that they can be quickly adapted to any arbitrary new tasks in a <b>zero-shot</b> manner. Our key insight is to learn a structured representation that preserves the temporal structure of the underlying environment, and then to span this learned latent space with directional movements, which enables various <b>zero-shot</b> policy <b>"prompting"</b> schemes for downstream tasks. Through our experiments on simulated robotic locomotion and manipulation <b>benchmarks,</b> we show that our <b>unsupervised</b> policies can solve goal-conditioned and general RL tasks in a <b>zero-shot</b> fashion, even often outperforming prior methods designed specifically for each setting. Our code and videos are available at https://seohong.me/projects/hilp/

**ABSTRACT**  
Establishing accurate field development parameters to optimize <b>long-term</b> <b>oil</b> <b>production</b> <b>takes</b> time and effort due to the complexity of oil well development, and the uncertainty in estimating <b>long-term</b> <b>well</b> <b>production.</b> <b>Traditionally,</b> oil and gas companies use <b>simulation</b> software that are inherently computationally expensive to forecast production. Thus, machine learning approaches are recently utilized in literature as an efficient alternative to optimize well developments by enhancing completion conditions. The primary goal of this project is to develop effective machine-learning models that can integrate the effects of multidimensional predictive variables (i.e., completion conditions) to predict 12-Month Cumulative Production accurately. Three predictive regression machine learning models are implemented for predicting 12-month cumulative oil production: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and <b>Long</b> <b>Short-Term</b> <b>Memory</b> <b>Models.</b> All three models yielded cumulative production predictions with root mean squared error (RMSE ) values ranging from 7.35 to 20.01 thousand barrels of oil. Although we hypothesized that all models would yield accurate predictions, the results indicated a crucial need for further refinement to create reliable and rational predictive tools in the subsurface. While this study did not produce optimal models for completion sequencing to maximize <b>long-term</b> <b>production,</b> <b>we</b> <b>established</b> that machine learning models alone are not self-sufficient for problems of this nature. Hence, there is potential for significant improvement, including comprehensive feature engineering, and a <b>recommendation</b> of exploring the use of hybrid or surrogate models (i.e., coupling physics reduced models and machine learning models), to ascertain significant contribution to the progress of completion sequencing workflows.

**ABSTRACT**  
Structural health monitoring (SHM) is vital for ensuring the safety and longevity of structures like buildings and bridges. As the volume and scale of structures and the impact of their failure continue to grow, there is a dire need for SHM techniques that are scalable, inexpensive, operate passively without <b>human</b> <b>intervention,</b> and customized for each mechanical structure without the need for complex baseline models. We present a novel "deploy-and-forget" approach for automated detection and localization of damages in structures. It is based on a synergistic combination of fully passive measurements from inexpensive sensors and a mechanics-informed <b>autoencoder.</b> Once deployed, our solution continuously learns and adapts a bespoke baseline model for each structure, learning from its undamaged state's response characteristics. After learning from just 3 hours of data, it can autonomously detect and localize different types of unforeseen damage. Results from numerical <b>simulations</b> and experiments indicate that incorporating the mechanical characteristics into the <b>variational</b> <b>autoencoder</b> allows for up to 35\% earlier detection and localization of damage over a standard <b>autoencoder.</b> Our approach holds substantial promise for a significant reduction in <b>human</b> <b>intervention</b> and inspection costs and enables proactive and preventive maintenance strategies, thus extending the lifespan, reliability, and sustainability of civil infrastructures.

**ABSTRACT**  
We tackle the problem of bias mitigation of algorithmic decisions in a setting where both the output of the algorithm and the sensitive variable are continuous. Most of prior work deals with discrete sensitive variables, meaning that the biases are measured for subgroups of persons defined by a label, leaving out important algorithmic bias cases, where the sensitive variable is continuous. Typical examples are unfair decisions made with respect to the age or the financial status. In our work, we then propose a bias mitigation strategy for continuous sensitive variables, based on the notion of endogeneity which comes from the field of econometrics. In addition to solve this new problem, our bias mitigation strategy is a <b>weakly</b> <b>supervised</b> <b>learning</b> method which requires that a small portion of the data can be measured in a fair manner. It is model agnostic, in the sense that it does not make any hypothesis on the prediction model. It also makes use of a reasonably large amount of input observations and their corresponding predictions. Only a small fraction of the true output predictions should be known. This therefore limits the need for expert interventions. Results obtained on synthetic data show the effectiveness of our approach for examples as close as possible to real-life applications in econometrics.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this work we show that the size versus accuracy trade-off of neural network <b>quantization</b> can be significantly improved by increasing the <b>quantization</b> dimensionality. We propose the GPTVQ method, a new fast method for post-training vector <b>quantization</b> (VQ) that scales well to <b>Large</b> <b>Language</b> <b>Models</b> <b>(LLMs).</b> Our method interleaves <b>quantization</b> of one or more columns with updates to the remaining unquantized weights, using information from the Hessian of the per-layer output reconstruction MSE. <b>Quantization</b> codebooks are initialized using an efficient data-aware version of the EM algorithm. The codebooks are then updated, and further compressed by using integer <b>quantization</b> and SVD-based compression. GPTVQ establishes a new state-of-the art in the size vs accuracy trade-offs on a wide range of <b>LLMs</b> such as <b>Llama-v2</b> and <b>Mistral.</b> Furthermore, our method is efficient: on a single H100 it takes between 3 and 11 hours to process a Llamav2-70B model, depending on <b>quantization</b> setting. Lastly, with on-device timings for VQ decompression on a mobile CPU we show that VQ leads to improved latency compared to using a 4-bit integer format.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Counterfactual</b> generation lies at the core of various machine learning tasks, including <b>image</b> <b>translation</b> and controllable <b>text</b> <b>generation.</b> This generation process usually requires the identification of the disentangled latent representations, such as content and <b>style,</b> <b>that</b> underlie the observed data. However, it becomes more challenging when faced with a scarcity of paired data and labeling information. Existing disentangled methods crucially rely on oversimplified assumptions, such as assuming independent content and <b>style</b> <b>variables,</b> to identify the latent variables, even though such assumptions may not hold for complex data distributions. For instance, food reviews tend to involve words like tasty, whereas movie reviews commonly contain words such as thrilling for the same positive sentiment. This problem is exacerbated when data are sampled from multiple domains since the dependence between content and <b>style</b> <b>may</b> vary significantly over domains. In this work, we tackle the domain-varying dependence between the content and the <b>style</b> <b>variables</b> inherent in the <b>counterfactual</b> generation task. We provide identification guarantees for such latent-variable models by leveraging the relative sparsity of the influences from different latent variables. Our theoretical insights enable the development of a doMain AdapTive <b>counTerfactual</b> gEneration model, called (MATTE). Our theoretically grounded framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in <b>unsupervised</b> <b>style</b> <b>transfer</b> tasks, where neither paired data nor <b>style</b> <b>labels</b> are utilized, across four large-scale datasets.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Graph</b> <b>contrastive</b> <b>learning</b> <b>(GCL)</b> aligns node representations by classifying node pairs into positives and negatives using a selection process that typically relies on establishing correspondences within two augmented <b>graphs.</b> <b>The</b> <b>conventional</b> <b>GCL</b> approaches incorporate negative samples uniformly in the <b>contrastive</b> <b>loss,</b> resulting in the equal treatment negative nodes, regardless of their proximity to the true positive. In this paper, we present a Smoothed <b>Graph</b> <b>Contrastive</b> <b>Learning</b> model (SGCL), which leverages the geometric structure of augmented <b>graphs</b> <b>to</b> <b>inject</b> proximity information associated with positive/negative pairs in the <b>contrastive</b> <b>loss,</b> thus significantly regularizing the learning process. The proposed SGCL adjusts the penalties associated with node pairs in the <b>contrastive</b> <b>loss</b> by incorporating three distinct smoothing techniques that result in proximity aware positives and negatives. To enhance scalability for large-scale <b>graphs,</b> <b>the</b> <b>proposed</b> framework incorporates a <b>graph</b> <b>batch-generating</b> <b>strategy</b> that partitions the given <b>graphs</b> <b>into</b> <b>multiple</b> subgraphs, facilitating efficient training in separate batches. Through extensive experimentation in the <b>unsupervised</b> setting on various <b>benchmarks,</b> particularly those of large scale, we demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework against recent baselines.

**ABSTRACT**  
In natural language processing and vision, pretraining is utilized to learn effective <b>representations.</b> <b>Unfortunately,</b> the success of pretraining does not easily carry over to time series due to potential mismatch between sources and target. Actually, common belief is that multi-dataset pretraining does not work for time series! Au contraire, we introduce a new <b>self-supervised</b> <b>contrastive</b> pretraining approach to learn one encoding from many unlabeled and diverse time series datasets, so that the single learned <b>representation</b> <b>can</b> then be reused in several target domains for, say, classification. Specifically, we propose the XD-MixUp interpolation method and the Soft Interpolation Contextual Contrasting (SICC) loss. Empirically, this outperforms both <b>supervised</b> training and other <b>self-supervised</b> <b>pretraining</b> methods when <b>finetuning</b> on low-data regimes. This disproves the common belief: We can actually learn from multiple time series datasets, even from 75 at once.

**ABSTRACT**  
By jointly learning multiple tasks, multi-task learning (MTL) can leverage the shared knowledge across tasks, resulting in improved data efficiency and generalization performance. However, a major challenge in MTL lies in the presence of conflicting gradients, which can hinder the fair optimization of some tasks and subsequently impede MTL's ability to achieve better overall performance. Inspired by fair resource allocation in communication networks, we formulate the optimization of MTL as a utility maximization problem, where the loss decreases across tasks are maximized under different <b>fairness</b> measurements. To solve this problem, we propose FairGrad, a novel MTL optimization method. FairGrad not only enables flexible emphasis on certain tasks but also achieves a theoretical convergence guarantee. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance among gradient manipulation methods on a suite of multi-task <b>benchmarks</b> in <b>supervised</b> <b>learning</b> and <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning.</b> Furthermore, we incorporate the idea of $\alpha$-fairness into loss functions of various MTL methods. Extensive empirical studies demonstrate that their performance can be significantly enhanced. Code is provided at \url{https://github.com/OptMN-Lab/fairgrad}.

**ABSTRACT**  
Grokking, or delayed generalization, is a phenomenon where generalization in a deep neural network (DNN) occurs long after achieving near zero training error. Previous studies have reported the occurrence of grokking in specific controlled settings, such as DNNs initialized with large-norm parameters or <b>transformers</b> trained on algorithmic datasets. We demonstrate that grokking is actually much more widespread and materializes in a wide range of practical settings, such as training of a <b>convolutional</b> <b>neural</b> <b>network</b> <b>(CNN)</b> on CIFAR10 or a Resnet on Imagenette. We introduce the new concept of delayed robustness, whereby a DNN groks adversarial examples and becomes robust, long after interpolation and/or generalization. We develop an analytical explanation for the emergence of both delayed generalization and delayed robustness based on a new measure of the local complexity of a DNN's input-output mapping. Our local complexity measures the density of the so-called 'linear regions' (aka, spline partition regions) that tile the DNN input space, and serves as a utile progress measure for training. We provide the first evidence that for classification problems, the linear regions undergo a phase transition during training whereafter they migrate away from the training samples (making the DNN mapping smoother there) and towards the decision boundary (making the DNN mapping less smooth there). Grokking occurs post phase transition as a robust partition of the input space emerges thanks to the linearization of the DNN mapping around the training points.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Diffusion</b> <b>models</b> excel at capturing complex data distributions, such as those of natural images and proteins. While <b>diffusion</b> <b>models</b> are trained to represent the distribution in the training dataset, we often are more concerned with other properties, such as the aesthetic quality of the generated images or the functional properties of generated proteins. <b>Diffusion</b> <b>models</b> can be <b>finetuned</b> in a goal-directed way by maximizing the value of some reward function (e.g., the aesthetic quality of an image). However, these approaches may lead to reduced sample diversity, significant deviations from the training data distribution, and even poor sample quality due to the exploitation of an imperfect reward function. The last issue often occurs when the reward function is a learned model meant to approximate a ground-truth "genuine" reward, as is the case in many practical applications. These challenges, collectively termed "reward collapse," pose a substantial obstacle. To address this reward collapse, we frame the <b>finetuning</b> problem as entropy-regularized control against the pretrained <b>diffusion</b> <b>model,</b> i.e., directly optimizing entropy-enhanced rewards with neural SDEs. We present theoretical and empirical evidence that demonstrates our framework is capable of efficiently generating diverse samples with high genuine rewards, mitigating the overoptimization of imperfect reward models.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Transformer-based</b> models have significantly improved performance across a range of <b>multimodal</b> understanding tasks, such as <b>visual</b> <b>question</b> <b>answering</b> and action recognition. However, <b>multimodal</b> <b>Transformers</b> significantly suffer from a quadratic complexity of the multi-head attention with the input sequence length, especially as the number of modalities increases. To address this, we introduce Low-Cost <b>Multimodal</b> <b>Transformer</b> (LoCoMT), a novel <b>multimodal</b> attention mechanism that aims to reduce computational cost during training and inference with minimal performance loss. Specifically, by assigning different <b>multimodal</b> attention patterns to each attention head, LoCoMT can flexibly control <b>multimodal</b> signals and theoretically ensures a reduced computational cost compared to existing <b>multimodal</b> <b>Transformer</b> variants. Experimental results on two <b>multimodal</b> datasets, namely Audioset and MedVidCL demonstrate that LoCoMT not only reduces GFLOPs but also matches or even outperforms established models.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper presents a novel study of the oversmoothing issue in diffusion-based <b>Graph</b> <b>Neural</b> <b>Networks</b> <b>(GNNs).</b> Diverging from extant approaches grounded in random walk analysis or particle systems, we approach this problem through operator semigroup theory. This theoretical framework allows us to rigorously prove that oversmoothing is intrinsically linked to the ergodicity of the diffusion operator. This finding further poses a general and mild ergodicity-breaking condition, encompassing the various specific solutions previously offered, thereby presenting a more universal and theoretically grounded approach to mitigating oversmoothing in diffusion-based <b>GNNs.</b> Additionally, we offer a probabilistic interpretation of our theory, forging a link with prior works and broadening the theoretical horizon. Our experimental results reveal that this ergodicity-breaking term effectively mitigates oversmoothing measured by Dirichlet energy, and simultaneously enhances performance in <b>node</b> <b>classification</b> tasks.

**ABSTRACT**  
Spatiotemporal modeling is critical for understanding complex systems across various scientific and engineering disciplines, but governing equations are often not fully known or computationally intractable due to inherent system complexity. Data-driven reduced-order models (ROMs) offer a promising approach for fast and accurate spatiotemporal forecasting by computing solutions in a compressed latent space. However, these models often neglect temporal correlations between consecutive snapshots when constructing the latent space, leading to suboptimal compression, jagged latent trajectories, and limited extrapolation ability over time. To address these issues, this paper introduces a continuous operator learning framework that incorporates jerk regularization into the learning of the compressed latent space. This jerk regularization promotes smoothness and sparsity of latent space dynamics, which not only yields enhanced accuracy and convergence speed but also helps identify intrinsic latent space coordinates. Consisting of an implicit neural representation (INR)-based <b>autoencoder</b> and a neural ODE latent dynamics model, the framework allows for inference at any desired spatial or temporal resolution. The effectiveness of this framework is demonstrated through a two-dimensional unsteady flow problem governed by the Navier-Stokes equations, highlighting its potential to expedite high-fidelity <b>simulations</b> in various scientific and engineering applications.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Transformers</b> have become pivotal in Natural Language Processing, demonstrating remarkable success in applications like <b>Machine</b> <b>Translation</b> and <b>Summarization.</b> Given their widespread adoption, several works have attempted to analyze the expressivity of <b>Transformers.</b> Expressivity of a neural network is the class of functions it can approximate. A neural network is fully expressive if it can act as a universal function approximator. We attempt to analyze the same for <b>Transformers.</b> Contrary to existing claims, our findings reveal that <b>Transformers</b> struggle to reliably approximate continuous functions, relying on piecewise constant approximations with sizable intervals. The central question emerges as: "\textit{Are <b>Transformers</b> truly Universal Function Approximators}?" To address this, we conduct a thorough investigation, providing theoretical insights and supporting evidence through experiments. Our contributions include a theoretical analysis pinpointing the root of <b>Transformers'</b> limitation in function approximation and extensive experiments to verify the limitation. By shedding light on these challenges, we advocate a refined understanding of <b>Transformers'</b> capabilities.

**ABSTRACT**  
Parameter-efficient <b>fine-tuning</b> stands as the standard for efficiently <b>fine-tuning</b> large language and vision models on downstream tasks. Specifically, the efficiency of low-rank adaptation has facilitated the creation and sharing of hundreds of custom LoRA modules, each trained on distinct data from various downstream tasks. In this paper, we explore the composability of LoRA modules, examining if combining these pre-trained modules enhances generalization to unseen downstream tasks. Our investigation involves evaluating two approaches: (a) uniform composition, involving averaging upstream LoRA modules with equal weights, and (b) learned composition, where we learn the weights for each upstream module and perform weighted averaging. Our experimental results on both vision and language models reveal that in <b>few-shot</b> settings, where only a limited number of samples are available for the downstream task, both uniform and learned composition methods result in better transfer accuracy; outperforming full <b>fine-tuning</b> and training a LoRA from scratch. Moreover, in full-shot settings, learned composition performs comparably to regular LoRA training with significantly fewer number of trainable parameters. Our research unveils the potential of uniform composition for enhancing transferability in low-shot settings, without introducing additional learnable parameters.

**ABSTRACT**  
In an unfamiliar setting, a model-based <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning</b> agent can be limited by the accuracy of its world model. In this work, we present a novel, training-free approach to improving the performance of such agents separately from planning and learning. We do so by applying iterative inference at decision-time, to <b>fine-tune</b> the inferred agent states based on the coherence of future state representations. Our approach achieves a consistent improvement in both reconstruction accuracy and task performance when applied to visual 3D navigation tasks. We go on to show that considering more future states further improves the performance of the agent in partially-observable environments, but not in a fully-observable one. Finally, we demonstrate that agents with less training pre-evaluation benefit most from our approach.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Self-attention</b> is an essential component of large language models(LLMs) but a significant source of inference latency for long sequences. In multi-tenant <b>LLMs</b> serving scenarios, the compute and memory operation cost of <b>self-attention</b> can be optimized by using the probability that multiple <b>LLM</b> requests have shared system <b>prompts</b> in prefixes. In this paper, we introduce ChunkAttention, a prefix-aware <b>self-attention</b> module that can detect matching <b>prompt</b> prefixes across multiple requests and share their key/value tensors in memory at runtime to improve the memory utilization of KV cache. This is achieved by breaking monolithic key/value tensors into smaller chunks and structuring them into the auxiliary prefix tree. Consequently, on top of the prefix-tree based KV cache, we design an efficient <b>self-attention</b> kernel, where a two-phase partition algorithm is implemented to improve the data locality during <b>self-attention</b> computation in the presence of shared system <b>prompts.</b> Experiments show that ChunkAttention can speed up the <b>self-attention</b> kernel by 3.2-4.8$\times$ compared to the start-of-the-art implementation, with the length of the system <b>prompt</b> ranging from 1024 to 4096.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Fine-tuning</b> <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> <b>(LLMs)</b> with classic first-order optimizers entails prohibitive GPU memory due to the backpropagation process. Recent works have turned to zeroth-order optimizers for <b>fine-tuning,</b> which save substantial memory by using two forward passes. However, these optimizers are plagued by the heterogeneity of parameter curvatures across different dimensions. In this work, we propose HiZOO, a diagonal Hessian informed zeroth-order optimizer which is the first work to leverage the diagonal Hessian to enhance zeroth-order optimizer for <b>fine-tuning</b> <b>LLMs.</b> What's more, HiZOO avoids the expensive memory cost and only increases one forward pass per step. Extensive experiments on various models (350M~66B parameters) indicate that HiZOO improves model convergence, significantly reducing training steps and effectively enhancing model accuracy. Moreover, we visualize the optimization trajectories of HiZOO on test functions, illustrating its effectiveness in handling heterogeneous curvatures. Lastly, we provide theoretical proofs of convergence for HiZOO. Code is publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/HiZOO27F8.

**ABSTRACT**  
Episodic memory plays a crucial role in various cognitive processes, such as the ability to mentally recall past events. While cognitive science emphasizes the significance of spatial context in the formation and retrieval of episodic memory, the current primary approach to implementing episodic memory in AI systems is through <b>transformers</b> that store temporally ordered experiences, which overlooks the spatial dimension. As a result, it is unclear how the underlying structure could be extended to incorporate the spatial axis beyond temporal order alone and thereby what benefits can be obtained. To address this, this paper explores the use of Spatially-Aware <b>Transformer</b> models that incorporate spatial information. These models enable the creation of place-centric episodic memory that considers both temporal and spatial dimensions. Adopting this approach, we demonstrate that memory utilization efficiency can be improved, leading to enhanced accuracy in various place-centric downstream tasks. Additionally, we propose the Adaptive Memory Allocator, a memory management method based on <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning</b> that aims to optimize efficiency of memory utilization.

**ABSTRACT**  
Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD) is a prominent particle-based variational inference method used for sampling a target distribution. SVGD has attracted interest for application in machine-learning techniques such as Bayesian inference. In this paper, we propose novel trainable algorithms that incorporate a deep-learning technique called deep unfolding,into SVGD. This approach facilitates the learning of the internal parameters of SVGD, thereby accelerating its convergence speed. To evaluate the proposed trainable SVGD algorithms, we conducted numerical <b>simulations</b> of three tasks: sampling a one-dimensional Gaussian mixture, performing Bayesian <b>logistic</b> <b>regression,</b> and learning Bayesian neural networks. The results show that our proposed algorithms exhibit faster convergence than the conventional variants of SVGD.

**ABSTRACT**  
In online advertising, advertisers participate in ad auctions to acquire ad opportunities, often by utilizing auto-bidding tools provided by demand-side platforms (DSPs). The current auto-bidding algorithms typically employ <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning</b> (RL). However, due to safety concerns, most RL-based auto-bidding policies are trained in <b>simulation,</b> leading to a performance degradation when deployed in online environments. To narrow this gap, we can deploy multiple auto-bidding agents in parallel to collect a large interaction dataset. Offline RL algorithms can then be utilized to train a new policy. The trained policy can subsequently be deployed for further data collection, resulting in an iterative training framework, which we refer to as iterative offline RL. In this work, we identify the performance bottleneck of this iterative offline RL framework, which originates from the ineffective exploration and exploitation caused by the inherent conservatism of offline RL algorithms. To overcome this bottleneck, we propose Trajectory-wise Exploration and Exploitation (TEE), which introduces a novel data collecting and data utilization method for iterative offline RL from a trajectory perspective. Furthermore, to ensure the safety of online exploration while preserving the dataset quality for TEE, we propose Safe Exploration by Adaptive Action Selection (SEAS). Both offline experiments and real-world experiments on Alibaba display advertising platform demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

**ABSTRACT**  
One-shot <b>Federated</b> <b>Learning</b> (OFL) has become a promising learning paradigm, enabling the training of a global server model via a single communication round. In OFL, the server model is aggregated by <b>distilling</b> knowledge from all client models (the ensemble), which are also responsible for synthesizing samples for <b>distillation.</b> In this regard, advanced works show that the performance of the server model is intrinsically related to the quality of the synthesized data and the ensemble model. To promote OFL, we introduce a novel framework, Co-Boosting, in which synthesized data and the ensemble model mutually enhance each other progressively. Specifically, Co-Boosting leverages the current ensemble model to synthesize higher-quality samples in an adversarial manner. These hard samples are then employed to promote the quality of the ensemble model by adjusting the ensembling weights for each client model. Consequently, Co-Boosting periodically achieves high-quality data and ensemble models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Co-Boosting can substantially outperform existing baselines under various settings. Moreover, Co-Boosting eliminates the need for adjustments to the client's local training, requires no additional data or model transmission, and allows client models to have heterogeneous architectures.

**ABSTRACT**  
Automated machine learning (AutoML) is a collection of techniques designed to automate the machine learning development process. While traditional AutoML approaches have been successfully applied in several critical steps of model development (e.g. hyperparameter optimization), there lacks a AutoML system that automates the entire end-to-end model production workflow. To fill this blank, we present AutoMMLab, a general-purpose <b>LLM-empowered</b> AutoML system that follows user's language instructions to automate the whole model production workflow for computer vision tasks. The proposed AutoMMLab system effectively employs <b>LLMs</b> as the bridge to connect AutoML and OpenMMLab community, empowering non-expert individuals to easily build task-specific models via a user-friendly language interface. Specifically, we propose RU-LLaMA to understand users' request and schedule the whole pipeline, and propose a novel <b>LLM-based</b> hyperparameter optimizer called HPO-LLaMA to effectively search for the optimal hyperparameters. Experiments show that our AutoMMLab system is versatile and covers a wide range of mainstream tasks, including classification, detection, segmentation and keypoint estimation. We further develop a new <b>benchmark,</b> called LAMP, for studying key components in the end-to-end <b>prompt-based</b> model training pipeline. Code, model, and data will be released.

**ABSTRACT**  
Causal discovery in the presence of missing data introduces a chicken-and-egg dilemma. While the goal is to recover the true causal structure, robust imputation requires considering the dependencies or preferably causal relations among variables. Merely filling in missing values with existing imputation methods and subsequently applying structure learning on the complete data is empirical shown to be sub-optimal. To this end, we propose in this paper a score-based algorithm, based on optimal transport, for learning causal structure from missing data. This optimal transport viewpoint diverges from existing score-based approaches that are dominantly based on EM. We project structure learning as a density fitting problem, where the goal is to find the causal model that induces a distribution of minimum Wasserstein distance with the distribution over the observed data. Through extensive <b>simulations</b> and real-data experiments, our framework is shown to recover the true causal <b>graphs</b> more effectively than the baselines in various <b>simulations</b> and real-data experiments. Empirical evidences also demonstrate the superior scalability of our approach, along with the flexibility to incorporate any off-the-shelf causal discovery methods for complete data.

**ABSTRACT**  
Memory-based Temporal <b>Graph</b> <b>Neural</b> <b>Networks</b> (MTGNNs) are a class of temporal <b>graph</b> <b>neural</b> <b>networks</b> that utilize a node memory module to capture and retain long-term temporal dependencies, leading to superior performance compared to memory-less counterparts. However, the iterative reading and updating process of the memory module in MTGNNs to obtain up-to-date information needs to follow the temporal dependencies. This introduces significant overhead and limits training throughput. Existing optimizations for static <b>GNNs</b> are not directly applicable to MTGNNs due to differences in training paradigm, model architecture, and the absence of a memory module. Moreover, they do not effectively address the challenges posed by temporal dependencies, making them ineffective for MTGNN training. In this paper, we propose MSPipe, a general and efficient framework for MTGNNs that maximizes training throughput while maintaining model accuracy. Our design addresses the unique challenges associated with fetching and updating node memory states in MTGNNs by integrating staleness into the memory module. However, simply introducing a predefined staleness bound in the memory module to break temporal dependencies may lead to suboptimal performance and lack of generalizability across different models and datasets. To solve this, we introduce an online pipeline scheduling algorithm in MSPipe that strategically breaks temporal dependencies with minimal staleness and delays memory fetching to obtain fresher memory states. Moreover, we design a staleness mitigation mechanism to enhance training convergence and model accuracy. We provide convergence analysis and prove that MSPipe maintains the same convergence rate as vanilla sample-based <b>GNN</b> training. Experimental results show that MSPipe achieves up to 2.45x speed-up without sacrificing accuracy, making it a promising solution for efficient MTGNN training.

**ABSTRACT**  
Algorithmic recourse recommends a cost-efficient action to a subject to reverse an unfavorable machine learning classification decision. Most existing methods in the literature generate recourse under the assumption of complete knowledge about the cost function. In real-world practice, subjects could have distinct preferences, leading to incomplete information about the underlying cost function of the subject. This paper proposes a two-step approach integrating preference learning into the recourse generation problem. In the first step, we design a <b>question-answering</b> <b>framework</b> to refine the confidence set of the Mahalanobis matrix cost of the subject sequentially. Then, we generate recourse by utilizing two methods: gradient-based and <b>graph-based</b> cost-adaptive recourse that ensures validity while considering the whole confidence set of the cost matrix. The numerical evaluation demonstrates the benefits of our approach over state-of-the-art baselines in delivering cost-efficient recourse <b>recommendations.</b>

**ABSTRACT**  
We present the design, implementation and engineering experience in building and deploying MegaScale, a production system for training <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> <b>(LLMs)</b> at the scale of more than 10,000 GPUs. Training <b>LLMs</b> at this scale brings unprecedented challenges to training efficiency and stability. We take a full-stack approach that co-designs the algorithmic and system components across model block and optimizer design, computation and communication overlapping, operator optimization, data pipeline, and network performance tuning. Maintaining high efficiency throughout the training process (i.e., stability) is an important consideration in production given the long extent of <b>LLM</b> training jobs. Many hard stability issues only emerge at <b>large</b> <b>scale,</b> <b>and</b> in-depth observability is the key to address them. We develop a set of diagnosis tools to monitor system components and events deep in the stack, identify root causes, and derive effective techniques to achieve fault tolerance and mitigate stragglers. MegaScale achieves 55.2% Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU) when training a 175B <b>LLM</b> model on 12,288 GPUs, improving the MFU by 1.34x compared to Megatron-LM. We share our operational experience in identifying and fixing failures and stragglers. We hope by articulating the problems and sharing our experience from a systems perspective, this work can inspire future <b>LLM</b> systems research.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this work, we investigate binary classification under the constraints of both <b>differential</b> <b>privacy</b> and <b>fairness.</b> We first propose an algorithm based on the decoupling technique for learning a classifier with only <b>fairness</b> guarantee. This algorithm takes in classifiers trained on different demographic groups and generates a single classifier satisfying statistical parity. We then refine this algorithm to incorporate <b>differential</b> <b>privacy.</b> The performance of the final algorithm is rigorously examined in terms of privacy, <b>fairness,</b> and utility guarantees. Empirical evaluations conducted on the Adult and Credit Card datasets illustrate that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of <b>fairness</b> guarantees, while maintaining the same level of privacy and utility.

**ABSTRACT**  
The availability of large annotated data can be a critical bottleneck in training machine learning algorithms successfully, especially when applied to diverse domains. <b>Weak</b> <b>supervision</b> offers a promising alternative by accelerating the creation of labeled training data using domain-specific rules. However, it requires users to write a diverse set of high-quality rules to assign labels to the unlabeled data. Automatic Rule Induction (ARI) approaches circumvent this problem by automatically creating rules from features on a small labeled set and filtering a final set of rules from them. In the ARI approach, the crucial step is to filter out a set of a high-quality useful subset of rules from the large set of automatically created rules. In this paper, we propose an algorithm (Filtering of Automatically Induced Rules) to filter rules from a large number of automatically induced rules using submodular objective functions that account for the collective precision, coverage, and conflicts of the rule set. We experiment with three ARI approaches and five <b>text</b> <b>classification</b> datasets to validate the superior performance of our algorithm with respect to several semi-supervised label aggregation approaches. Further, we show that achieves statistically significant results in comparison to existing rule-filtering approaches.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this paper, we employ the mathematical framework on <b>Transformers</b> developed by \citet{sander2022sinkformers,geshkovski2023emergence,geshkovski2023mathematical} to explore how variations in attention parameters and initial token values impact the structural dynamics of token clusters. Our analysis demonstrates that while the clusters within a modified attention matrix dynamics can exhibit significant divergence from the original over extended periods, they maintain close similarities over shorter intervals, depending on the parameter differences. This work contributes to the <b>fine-tuning</b> field through practical applications to the LoRA algorithm \cite{hu2021lora,peft}, enhancing our understanding of the behavior of LoRA-enhanced <b>Transformer</b> models.

**ABSTRACT**  
We introduce Genie, the first generative interactive environment trained in an <b>unsupervised</b> manner from unlabelled Internet videos. The model can be <b>prompted</b> to generate an endless variety of action-controllable virtual worlds described through text, synthetic images, photographs, and even sketches. At 11B parameters, Genie can be considered a foundation world model. It is comprised of a spatiotemporal video tokenizer, an autoregressive dynamics model, and a simple and scalable latent action model. Genie enables users to act in the generated environments on a frame-by-frame basis despite training without any ground-truth action labels or other domain-specific requirements typically found in the world model literature. Further the resulting learned latent action space facilitates training agents to imitate behaviors from unseen videos, opening the path for training generalist agents of the future.

**ABSTRACT**  
Prior interpretability research studying narrow distributions has preliminarily identified self-repair, a phenomena where if components in <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> are ablated, later components will change their behavior to compensate. Our work builds off this past literature, demonstrating that self-repair exists on a variety of models families and sizes when ablating individual attention heads on the full training distribution. We further show that on the full training distribution self-repair is imperfect, as the original direct effect of the head is not fully restored, and noisy, since the degree of self-repair varies significantly across different <b>prompts</b> (sometimes overcorrecting beyond the original effect). We highlight two different mechanisms that contribute to self-repair, including changes in the final LayerNorm scaling factor (which can repair up to 30% of the direct effect) and sparse sets of neurons implementing Anti-Erasure. We additionally discuss the implications of these results for interpretability practitioners and close with a more speculative discussion on the mystery of why self-repair occurs in these models at all, highlighting evidence for the Iterative Inference hypothesis in language models, a framework that predicts self-repair.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Adversarial</b> <b>Training</b> (AT), which adversarially perturb the input samples during training, has been acknowledged as one of the most effective defenses against <b>adversarial</b> <b>attacks,</b> yet suffers from a fundamental tradeoff that inevitably decreases clean accuracy. Instead of perturbing the samples, Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) perturbs the model weights during training to find a more flat loss landscape and improve generalization. However, as SAM is designed for better clean accuracy, its effectiveness in enhancing <b>adversarial</b> <b>robustness</b> remains unexplored. In this work, considering the duality between SAM and AT, we investigate the <b>adversarial</b> <b>robustness</b> derived from SAM. Intriguingly, we find that using SAM alone can improve <b>adversarial</b> <b>robustness.</b> To understand this unexpected property of SAM, we first provide empirical and theoretical insights into how SAM can implicitly learn more robust features, and conduct comprehensive experiments to show that SAM can improve <b>adversarial</b> <b>robustness</b> notably without sacrificing any clean accuracy, shedding light on the potential of SAM to be a substitute for AT when accuracy comes at a higher priority. Code is available at https://github.com/weizeming/SAM_AT.

**ABSTRACT**  
Multivariate time series <b>(MTS)</b> forecasting is crucial in many real-world applications. To achieve accurate <b>MTS</b> forecasting, it is essential to simultaneously consider both intra- and inter-series relationships among time series data. However, previous work has typically modeled intra- and inter-series relationships separately and has disregarded multi-order interactions present within and between time series data, which can seriously degrade forecasting accuracy. In this paper, we reexamine intra- and inter-series relationships from the perspective of <b>mutual</b> <b>information</b> and accordingly construct a comprehensive relationship learning mechanism tailored to simultaneously capture the intricate multi-order intra- and inter-series couplings. Based on the mechanism, we propose a novel deep coupling network for <b>MTS</b> forecasting, named DeepCN, which consists of a coupling mechanism dedicated to explicitly exploring the multi-order intra- and inter-series relationships among time series data concurrently, a coupled variable representation module aimed at encoding diverse variable patterns, and an inference module facilitating predictions through one forward step. Extensive experiments conducted on seven real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed DeepCN achieves superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art baselines.

**ABSTRACT**  
Understanding the link between urban planning and commuting flows is crucial for guiding urban development and policymaking. This research, bridging computer science and urban studies, addresses the challenge of integrating these fields with their distinct focuses. Traditional urban studies methods, like the gravity and radiation models, often underperform in complex scenarios due to their limited handling of multiple variables and reliance on overly simplistic and unrealistic assumptions, such as spatial isotropy. While deep learning models offer improved accuracy, their <b>black-box</b> <b>nature</b> poses a trade-off between performance and explainability -- both vital for analyzing complex societal phenomena like commuting flows. To address this, we introduce TransFlower, an explainable, <b>transformer-based</b> model employing flow-to-flow attention to predict urban commuting patterns. It features a geospatial encoder with an anisotropy-aware relative location encoder for nuanced flow representation. Following this, the <b>transformer-based</b> flow predictor enhances this by leveraging attention mechanisms to efficiently capture flow interactions. Our model outperforms existing methods by up to 30.8% Common Part of Commuters, offering insights into mobility dynamics crucial for urban planning and policy decisions.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper studies performative risk minimization, a formulation of stochastic optimization under decision-dependent distributions. We consider the general case where the performative risk can be non-convex, for which we develop efficient parameter-free optimistic optimization-based methods. Our algorithms significantly improve upon the existing Lipschitz <b>bandit-based</b> method in many aspects. In particular, our framework does not require knowledge about the sensitivity parameter of the distribution map and the Lipshitz constant of the loss function. This makes our framework practically favorable, together with the efficient optimistic optimization-based tree-search mechanism. We provide experimental results that demonstrate the numerical superiority of our algorithms over the existing method and other <b>black-box</b> <b>optimistic</b> optimization methods.

**ABSTRACT**  
Safe <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning</b> tasks with multiple constraints are a challenging domain despite being very common in the real world. To address this challenge, we propose Objective Suppression, a novel method that adaptively suppresses the task reward maximizing objectives according to a safety critic. We <b>benchmark</b> Objective Suppression in two multi-constraint safety domains, including an autonomous driving domain where any incorrect behavior can lead to disastrous consequences. Empirically, we demonstrate that our proposed method, when combined with existing safe RL algorithms, can match the task reward achieved by our baselines with significantly fewer constraint violations.

**ABSTRACT**  
Steering the behavior of a strong model pre-trained on internet-scale data can be difficult due to the scarcity of competent supervisors. Recent studies reveal that, despite supervisory noises, a strong student model may surpass its weak teacher when <b>fine-tuned</b> on specific objectives. Yet, the effectiveness of such weak-to-strong generalization remains limited, especially in the presence of large capability gaps. In this paper, we propose to address this challenge by harnessing a diverse set of specialized teachers, instead of a single generalist one, that collectively supervises the strong student. Our approach resembles the classical hierarchical mixture of experts, with two components tailored for co-supervision: (i) we progressively alternate student training and teacher assignment, leveraging the growth of the strong student to identify plausible supervisions; (ii) we conservatively enforce teacher-student and local-global consistency, leveraging their dependencies to reject potential annotation noises. We validate the proposed method through visual recognition tasks on the OpenAI weak-to-strong <b>benchmark</b> and additional multi-domain datasets. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/yuejiangliu/csl}.

**ABSTRACT**  
While machine learning methods excel at pattern recognition, they struggle with complex <b>reasoning</b> tasks in a scalable, algorithmic manner. Recent Deep Thinking methods show promise in learning algorithms that extrapolate: learning in smaller environments and executing the learned algorithm in larger environments. However, these works are limited to symmetrical tasks, where the input and output dimensionalities are the same. To address this gap, we propose NeuralThink, a new recurrent architecture that can consistently extrapolate to both symmetrical and asymmetrical tasks, where the dimensionality of the input and output are different. We contribute with a novel <b>benchmark</b> of asymmetrical tasks for extrapolation. We show that NeuralThink consistently outperforms the prior state-of-the-art Deep Thinking architectures, in regards to stable extrapolation to large observations from smaller training sizes.

**ABSTRACT**  
Vehicle routing problems (VRPs), which can be found in numerous real-world applications, have been an important research topic for several decades. Recently, the neural combinatorial optimization (NCO) approach that leverages a learning-based model to solve VRPs without manual algorithm design has gained substantial attention. However, current NCO methods typically require building one model for each routing problem, which significantly hinders their practical application for real-world industry problems with diverse attributes. In this work, we make the first attempt to tackle the crucial challenge of cross-problem generalization. In particular, we formulate VRPs as different combinations of a set of shared underlying attributes and solve them simultaneously via a single model through attribute composition. In this way, our proposed model can successfully solve VRPs with unseen attribute combinations in a <b>zero-shot</b> generalization manner. Extensive experiments are conducted on eleven VRP variants, <b>benchmark</b> datasets, and industry logistic scenarios. The results show that the unified model demonstrates superior performance in the eleven VRPs, reducing the average gap to around 5% from over 20% in the existing approach and achieving a significant performance boost on <b>benchmark</b> datasets as well as a real-world logistics application.

**ABSTRACT**  
Predictive analytics is widely used in various domains, including education, to inform decision-making and improve outcomes. However, many predictive models are proprietary and inaccessible for evaluation or modification by researchers and practitioners, limiting their accountability and ethical design. Moreover, predictive models are often opaque and incomprehensible to the officials who use them, reducing their trust and utility. Furthermore, predictive models may introduce or exacerbate bias and inequity, as they have done in many sectors of society. Therefore, there is a need for transparent, interpretable, and fair predictive models that can be easily adopted and adapted by different stakeholders. In this paper, we propose a fair predictive model based on multivariate adaptive regression splines(MARS) that incorporates <b>fairness</b> measures in the learning process. MARS is a non-parametric regression model that performs feature selection, handles non-linear relationships, generates interpretable decision rules, and derives optimal splitting criteria on the variables. Specifically, we integrate <b>fairness</b> into the knot optimization algorithm and provide theoretical and empirical evidence of how it results in a fair knot placement. We apply our fairMARS model to real-world data and demonstrate its effectiveness in terms of accuracy and equity. Our paper contributes to the advancement of responsible and ethical predictive analytics for social good.

**ABSTRACT**  
We study the problem of online learning in contextual <b>bandit</b> problems where the loss function is assumed to belong to a known parametric function class. We propose a new analytic framework for this setting that bridges the Bayesian theory of information-directed sampling due to Russo and Van Roy (2018) and the worst-case theory of Foster, Kakade, Qian, and Rakhlin (2021) based on the decision-estimation coefficient. Drawing from both lines of work, we propose a algorithmic template called Optimistic Information-Directed Sampling and show that it can achieve instance-dependent regret guarantees similar to the ones achievable by the classic Bayesian IDS method, but with the major advantage of not requiring any Bayesian assumptions. The key technical innovation of our analysis is introducing an optimistic surrogate model for the regret and using it to define a frequentist version of the Information Ratio of Russo and Van Roy (2018), and a less conservative version of the Decision Estimation Coefficient of Foster et al. (2021). Keywords: Contextual <b>bandits,</b> information-directed sampling, decision estimation coefficient, first-order regret bounds.

**ABSTRACT**  
We study off-dynamics <b>Reinforcement</b> <b>Learning</b> (RL), where the policy is trained on a source domain and deployed to a distinct target domain. We aim to solve this problem via online distributionally robust Markov decision processes (DRMDPs), where the learning algorithm actively interacts with the source domain while seeking the optimal performance under the worst possible dynamics that is within an uncertainty set of the source domain's transition kernel. We provide the first study on online DRMDPs with function approximation for off-dynamics RL. We find that DRMDPs' dual formulation can induce nonlinearity, even when the nominal transition kernel is linear, leading to error propagation. By designing a $d$-rectangular uncertainty set using the total variation distance, we remove this additional nonlinearity and bypass the error propagation. We then introduce DR-LSVI-UCB, the first provably efficient online DRMDP algorithm for off-dynamics RL with function approximation, and establish a polynomial suboptimality bound that is independent of the state and action space sizes. Our work makes the first step towards a deeper understanding of the provable efficiency of online DRMDPs with linear function approximation. Finally, we substantiate the performance and robustness of DR-LSVI-UCB through different numerical experiments.

**ABSTRACT**  
Inverse <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning</b> (IRL) aims to recover the reward function of an expert agent from demonstrations of behavior. It is well known that the IRL problem is fundamentally ill-posed, i.e., many reward functions can explain the demonstrations. For this reason, IRL has been recently reframed in terms of estimating the feasible reward set, thus, postponing the selection of a single reward. However, so far, the available formulations and algorithmic solutions have been proposed and analyzed mainly for the online setting, where the learner can interact with the environment and query the expert at will. This is clearly unrealistic in most practical applications, where the availability of an offline dataset is a much more common scenario. In this paper, we introduce a novel notion of feasible reward set capturing the opportunities and limitations of the offline setting and we analyze the complexity of its estimation. This requires the introduction an original learning framework that copes with the intrinsic difficulty of the setting, for which the data coverage is not under control. Then, we propose two computationally and statistically efficient algorithms, IRLO and PIRLO, for addressing the problem. In particular, the latter adopts a specific form of pessimism to enforce the novel desirable property of inclusion monotonicity of the delivered feasible set. With this work, we aim to provide a panorama of the challenges of the offline IRL problem and how they can be fruitfully addressed.

**ABSTRACT**  
We consider a sequential decision making task, where the goal is to optimize an unknown function without evaluating parameters that violate an a~priori unknown (safety) constraint. A common approach is to place a <b>Gaussian</b> <b>process</b> prior on the unknown functions and allow evaluations only in regions that are safe with high probability. Most current methods rely on a discretization of the domain and cannot be directly extended to the continuous case. Moreover, the way in which they exploit regularity assumptions about the constraint introduces an additional critical hyperparameter. In this paper, we propose an information-theoretic safe exploration criterion that directly exploits the GP posterior to identify the most informative safe parameters to evaluate. The combination of this exploration criterion with a well known Bayesian optimization acquisition function yields a novel safe Bayesian optimization selection criterion. Our approach is naturally applicable to continuous domains and does not require additional explicit hyperparameters. We theoretically analyze the method and show that we do not violate the safety constraint with high probability and that we learn about the value of the safe optimum up to arbitrary precision. Empirical evaluations demonstrate improved data-efficiency and scalability.

**ABSTRACT**  
We present our position on the elusive quest for a general-purpose framework for specifying and studying deep learning architectures. Our opinion is that the key attempts made so far lack a coherent bridge between specifying constraints which models must satisfy and specifying their implementations. Focusing on building a such a bridge, we propose to apply category theory -- precisely, the universal algebra of monads valued in a 2-category of parametric maps -- as a single theory elegantly subsuming both of these flavours of neural network design. To defend our position, we show how this theory recovers constraints induced by geometric deep learning, as well as implementations of many architectures drawn from the diverse landscape of neural networks, such as <b>RNNs.</b> We also illustrate how the theory naturally encodes many standard constructs in computer science and automata theory.

**ABSTRACT**  
The trade-off between performance and computational efficiency in long-sequence modeling becomes a bottleneck for existing models. Inspired by the continuous state space models (SSMs) with multi-input and multi-output in control theory, we propose a new neural network called Linear Dynamics-embedded Neural Network (LDNN). SSMs' continuous, discrete, and <b>convolutional</b> properties enable LDNN to have few parameters, flexible inference, and efficient training in long-sequence tasks. Two efficient strategies, diagonalization and $'\text{Disentanglement then Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)}'$, are developed to reduce the time complexity of <b>convolution</b> from $O(LNH\max\{L, N\})$ to $O(LN\max \{H, \log L\})$. We further improve LDNN through bidirectional noncausal and multi-head settings to accommodate a broader range of applications. Extensive experiments on the Long Range Arena (LRA) demonstrate the effectiveness and state-of-the-art performance of LDNN.

**ABSTRACT**  
Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a valuable non-invasive tool for monitoring brain activity. The classification of fNIRS data in relation to conscious activity holds significance for advancing our understanding of the brain and facilitating the development of brain-computer interfaces (BCI). Many researchers have turned to deep learning to tackle the classification challenges inherent in fNIRS data due to its strong generalization and robustness. In the application of fNIRS, reliability is really important, and one mathematical formulation of the reliability of confidence is calibration. However, many researchers overlook the important issue of calibration. To address this gap, we propose integrating calibration into fNIRS field and assess the reliability of existing models. Surprisingly, our results indicate poor calibration performance in many proposed models. To advance calibration development in the fNIRS field, we <b>summarize</b> three practical tips. Through this letter, we hope to emphasize the critical role of calibration in fNIRS research and argue for enhancing the reliability of deep learning-based predictions in fNIRS classification tasks. All data from our experimental process are openly available on GitHub.

**ABSTRACT**  
Define an optimizer as having memory $k$ if it stores $k$ dynamically changing vectors in the parameter space. Classical <b>SGD</b> has memory $0$, momentum <b>SGD</b> optimizer has $1$ and Adam optimizer has $2$. We address the following questions: How can optimizers make use of more memory units? What information should be stored in them? How to use them for the learning steps? As an approach to the last question, we introduce a general method called "Retrospective Learning Law Correction" or shortly RLLC. This method is designed to calculate a dynamically varying linear combination (called learning law) of memory units, which themselves may evolve arbitrarily. We demonstrate RLLC on optimizers whose memory units have linear update rules and small memory ($\leq 4$ memory units). Our experiments show that in a variety of standard problems, these optimizers outperform the above mentioned three classical optimizers. We conclude that RLLC is a promising framework for boosting the performance of known optimizers by adding more memory units and by making them more adaptive.

**ABSTRACT**  
Vertical <b>Federated</b> <b>Learning</b> (VFL) has emerged as a popular machine learning paradigm, enabling model training across the data and the task parties with different features about the same user set while preserving data privacy. In production environment, VFL usually involves one task party and one data party. Fair and economically efficient feature trading is crucial to the commercialization of VFL, where the task party is considered as the data consumer who buys the data party's features. However, current VFL feature trading practices often price the data party's data as a whole and assume transactions occur prior to the performing VFL. Neglecting the performance gains resulting from traded features may lead to underpayment and overpayment issues. In this study, we propose a bargaining-based feature trading approach in VFL to encourage economically efficient transactions. Our model incorporates performance gain-based pricing, taking into account the revenue-based optimization objectives of both parties. We analyze the proposed bargaining model under perfect and imperfect performance information settings, proving the existence of an equilibrium that optimizes the parties' objectives. Moreover, we develop performance gain estimation-based bargaining strategies for imperfect performance information scenarios and discuss potential security issues and solutions. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed bargaining model.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Transfer</b> <b>learning</b> methods endeavor to leverage relevant knowledge from existing source pre-trained models or datasets to solve downstream target tasks. With the increase in the scale and quantity of available pre-trained models nowadays, it becomes critical to assess in advance whether they are suitable for a specific target task. Model transferability estimation is an emerging and growing area of interest, aiming to propose a metric to quantify this suitability without training them individually, which is computationally prohibitive. Despite extensive recent advances already devoted to this area, they have custom terminological definitions and experimental settings. In this survey, we present the first review of existing advances in this area and categorize them into two separate realms: source-free model transferability estimation and source-dependent model transferability estimation. Each category is systematically defined, accompanied by a comprehensive taxonomy. Besides, we address challenges and outline future research directions, intending to provide a comprehensive guide to aid researchers and practitioners.

**ABSTRACT**  
With the explosive growth of data, <b>continual</b> <b>learning</b> capability is increasingly important for neural networks. Due to catastrophic forgetting, neural networks inevitably forget the knowledge of old tasks after learning new ones. In visual classification scenario, a common practice of alleviating the forgetting is to constrain the backbone. However, the impact of classifiers is underestimated. In this paper, we analyze the variation of model predictions in sequential binary classification tasks and find that the norm of the equivalent one-class classifiers significantly affects the forgetting level. Based on this conclusion, we propose a two-stage <b>continual</b> <b>learning</b> algorithm named Fixed Random Classifier Rearrangement (FRCR). In first stage, FRCR replaces the learnable classifiers with fixed random classifiers, constraining the norm of the equivalent one-class classifiers without affecting the performance of the network. In second stage, FRCR rearranges the entries of new classifiers to implicitly reduce the drift of old latent representations. The experimental results on multiple datasets show that FRCR significantly mitigates the model forgetting; subsequent experimental analyses further validate the effectiveness of the algorithm.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Active</b> <b>learning</b> (AL) in open set scenarios presents a novel challenge of identifying the most valuable examples in an unlabeled data pool that comprises data from both known and unknown classes. Traditional methods prioritize selecting informative examples with low confidence, with the risk of mistakenly selecting unknown-class examples with similarly low confidence. Recent methods favor the most probable known-class examples, with the risk of picking simple already mastered examples. In this paper, we attempt to query examples that are both likely from known classes and highly informative, and propose a \textit{Bidirectional Uncertainty-based <b>Active</b> <b>Learning}</b> (BUAL) framework. Specifically, we achieve this by first pushing the unknown class examples toward regions with high-confidence predictions with our proposed \textit{Random Label Negative Learning} method. Then, we propose a \textit{Bidirectional Uncertainty sampling} strategy by jointly estimating uncertainty posed by both positive and negative learning to perform consistent and stable sampling. BUAL successfully extends existing uncertainty-based AL methods to complex open-set scenarios. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets with varying openness demonstrate that BUAL achieves state-of-the-art performance.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recent studies have uncovered intriguing phenomena in deep learning, such as grokking, double descent, and emergent abilities in <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models,</b> which challenge human intuition and are crucial for a deeper understanding of neural models. In this paper, we present a comprehensive framework that provides a unified view of these three phenomena, focusing on the competition between memorization and generalization circuits. This approach, initially employed to explain grokking, is extended in our work to encompass a wider range of model sizes and training data volumes. Our framework delineates four distinct training dynamics, each depending on varying combinations of model size and training data quantity. Utilizing this framework, we provide a detailed analysis of the double descent phenomenon and propose two verifiable predictions regarding its occurrence, both substantiated by our experimental results. Moreover, we expand our framework to the multi-task learning paradigm, demonstrating how algorithm tasks can be turned into emergent abilities. This offers a novel perspective to understand emergent abilities in <b>Large</b> <b>Language</b> <b>Models.</b>

**ABSTRACT**  
We address the problem of stochastic combinatorial semi-bandits, where a player can select from P subsets of a set containing d base items. Most existing algorithms (e.g. CUCB, ESCB, OLS-UCB) require prior knowledge on the reward distribution, like an upper bound on a sub-Gaussian proxy-variance, which is hard to estimate tightly. In this work, we design a variance-adaptive version of OLS-UCB, relying on an online estimation of the covariance structure. Estimating the coefficients of a covariance matrix is much more manageable in practical settings and results in improved regret upper bounds compared to proxy variance-based algorithms. When covariance coefficients are all non-negative, we show that our approach efficiently leverages the semi-bandit feedback and provably outperforms <b>bandit</b> feedback approaches, not only in exponential regimes where P $\gg$ d but also when P $\le$ d, which is not straightforward from most existing analyses.

**ABSTRACT**  
With the incorporation of the UNet architecture, diffusion <b>probabilistic</b> <b>models</b> have become a dominant force in image generation tasks. One key design in UNet is the skip connections between the encoder and decoder blocks. Although skip connections have been shown to improve training stability and model performance, we reveal that such shortcuts can be a limiting factor for the complexity of the transformation. As the sampling steps decrease, the generation process and the role of the UNet get closer to the push-forward transformations from Gaussian distribution to the target, posing a challenge for the network's complexity. To address this challenge, we propose Skip-Tuning, a simple yet surprisingly effective training-free tuning method on the skip connections. Our method can achieve 100% FID improvement for pretrained EDM on ImageNet 64 with only 19 NFEs (1.75), breaking the limit of ODE samplers regardless of sampling steps. Surprisingly, the improvement persists when we increase the number of sampling steps and can even surpass the best result from EDM-2 (1.58) with only 39 NFEs (1.57). Comprehensive exploratory experiments are conducted to shed light on the surprising effectiveness. We observe that while Skip-Tuning increases the score-matching losses in the pixel space, the losses in the feature space are reduced, particularly at intermediate noise levels, which coincide with the most effective range accounting for image quality improvement.

**ABSTRACT**  
We introduce a novel extension of the canonical multi-armed <b>bandit</b> problem that incorporates an additional strategic element: abstention. In this enhanced framework, the agent is not only tasked with selecting an arm at each time step, but also has the option to abstain from accepting the stochastic instantaneous reward before observing it. When opting for abstention, the agent either suffers a fixed regret or gains a guaranteed reward. Given this added layer of complexity, we ask whether we can develop efficient algorithms that are both asymptotically and minimax optimal. We answer this question affirmatively by designing and analyzing algorithms whose regrets meet their corresponding information-theoretic lower bounds. Our results offer valuable quantitative insights into the benefits of the abstention option, laying the groundwork for further exploration in other online decision-making problems with such an option. Numerical results further corroborate our theoretical findings.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Machine</b> <b>Unlearning</b> (MU) is to forget data from a well-trained model, which is practically important due to the "right to be forgotten". In this paper, we start from the fundamental distinction between training data and unseen data on their contribution to the model: the training data contributes to the final model while the unseen data does not. We theoretically discover that the input sensitivity can approximately measure the contribution and practically design an algorithm, called MU-Mis <b>(machine</b> <b>unlearning</b> via minimizing input sensitivity), to suppress the contribution of the forgetting data. Experimental results demonstrate that MU-Mis outperforms state-of-the-art MU methods significantly. Additionally, MU-Mis aligns more closely with the application of MU as it does not require the use of remaining data.

**ABSTRACT**  
As machine- and AI-generated content proliferates, protecting the intellectual property of generative models has become imperative, yet verifying data ownership poses formidable challenges, particularly in cases of unauthorized reuse of generated data. The challenge of verifying data ownership is further amplified by using Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS), which often functions as a <b>black-box</b> <b>system.</b> Our work is dedicated to detecting data reuse from even an individual sample. Traditionally, watermarking has been leveraged to detect AI-generated content. However, unlike watermarking techniques that embed additional information as triggers into models or generated content, potentially compromising output quality, our approach identifies latent fingerprints inherently present within the outputs through re-generation. We propose an explainable verification procedure that attributes data ownership through re-generation, and further amplifies these fingerprints in the generative models through iterative data re-generation. This methodology is theoretically grounded and demonstrates viability and robustness using recent advanced text and image generative models. Our methodology is significant as it goes beyond protecting the intellectual property of APIs and addresses important issues such as the spread of misinformation and academic misconduct. It provides a useful tool to ensure the integrity of sources and authorship, expanding its application in different scenarios where authenticity and ownership verification are essential.

**ABSTRACT**  
We introduce a lightweight, flexible and end-to-end trainable probability density model parameterized by a constrained Fourier basis. We assess its performance at approximating a range of <b>multi-modal</b> 1D densities, which are generally difficult to fit. In comparison to the deep factorized model introduced in [1], our model achieves a lower cross entropy at a similar computational budget. In addition, we also evaluate our method on a toy compression task, demonstrating its utility in learned compression.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper presents a novel approach to task grouping in Multitask Learning (MTL), advancing beyond existing methods by addressing key theoretical and practical limitations. Unlike prior studies, our approach offers a more theoretically grounded method that does not rely on restrictive assumptions for constructing transfer gains. We also propose a flexible mathematical programming formulation which can accommodate a wide spectrum of resource constraints, thus enhancing its versatility. Experimental results across diverse domains, including computer vision datasets, combinatorial optimization <b>benchmarks</b> and time series tasks, demonstrate the superiority of our method over extensive baselines, validating its effectiveness and general applicability in MTL.

**ABSTRACT**  
Blurring mean shift (BMS) algorithm, a variant of the mean shift algorithm, is a kernel-based iterative method for data <b>clustering,</b> where data points are clustered according to their convergent points via iterative blurring. In this paper, we analyze convergence properties of the BMS algorithm by leveraging its interpretation as an optimization procedure, which is known but has been underutilized in existing convergence studies. Whereas existing results on convergence properties applicable to multi-dimensional data only cover the case where all the blurred data point sequences converge to a single point, this study provides a convergence guarantee even when those sequences can converge to multiple points, yielding multiple clusters. This study also shows that the convergence of the BMS algorithm is fast by further leveraging geometrical characterization of the convergent points.

**ABSTRACT**  
Multi-pitch estimation is a decades-long research problem involving the detection of pitch activity associated with concurrent musical events within multi-instrument mixtures. <b>Supervised</b> <b>learning</b> techniques have demonstrated solid performance on more narrow characterizations of the task, but suffer from limitations concerning the shortage of large-scale and diverse polyphonic music datasets with multi-pitch annotations. We present a suite of <b>self-supervised</b> <b>learning</b> objectives for multi-pitch estimation, which encourage the concentration of support around harmonics, invariance to timbral transformations, and equivariance to geometric transformations. These objectives are sufficient to train an entirely <b>convolutional</b> <b>autoencoder</b> to produce multi-pitch salience-grams directly, without any <b>fine-tuning.</b> Despite training exclusively on a collection of synthetic single-note audio samples, our fully <b>self-supervised</b> <b>framework</b> generalizes to polyphonic music mixtures, and achieves performance comparable to <b>supervised</b> <b>models</b> trained on conventional multi-pitch datasets.

**ABSTRACT**  
The accuracy of modern automatic speaker verification (ASV) systems, when trained exclusively on adult <b>data,</b> <b>drops</b> substantially when applied to children's speech. The scarcity of children's speech corpora hinders <b>fine-tuning</b> ASV systems for children's speech. Hence, there is a timely need to explore more effective ways of reusing adults' speech <b>data.</b> <b>One</b> promising approach is to align vocal-tract parameters between adults and children through children-specific <b>data</b> <b>augmentation,</b> referred here to as ChildAugment. Specifically, we modify the formant frequencies and formant bandwidths of adult speech to emulate children's speech. The modified spectra are used to train ECAPA-TDNN (emphasized channel attention, propagation, and aggregation in time-delay neural network) recognizer for children. We compare ChildAugment against various state-of-the-art <b>data</b> <b>augmentation</b> techniques for children's ASV. We also extensively compare different scoring methods, including cosine scoring, PLDA (probabilistic linear discriminant analysis), and NPLDA (neural PLDA). We also propose a low-complexity weighted cosine score for extremely <b>low-resource</b> children ASV. Our findings on the CSLU kids corpus indicate that ChildAugment holds promise as a simple, acoustics-motivated approach, for improving state-of-the-art deep learning based ASV for children. We achieve up to 12.45% (boys) and 11.96% (girls) relative improvement over the baseline.

**ABSTRACT**  
Automatic music transcription (AMT) has achieved high accuracy for piano due to the availability of large, high-quality datasets such as MAESTRO and MAPS, but comparable datasets are not yet available for other instruments. In recent work, however, it has been demonstrated that aligning scores to transcription model activations can produce high quality AMT training data for instruments other than piano. Focusing on the guitar, we refine this approach to training on score data using a dataset of commercially available score-audio pairs. We propose the use of a high-resolution piano transcription model to train a new guitar transcription model. The resulting model obtains state-of-the-art transcription results on GuitarSet in a <b>zero-shot</b> context, improving on previously published methods.

**ABSTRACT**  
Table structure recognition (TSR) aims to convert tabular images into a machine-readable format. Although hybrid <b>convolutional</b> <b>neural</b> <b>network</b> <b>(CNN)-transformer</b> architecture is widely used in existing approaches, linear projection <b>transformer</b> has outperformed the hybrid architecture in numerous vision tasks due to its simplicity and efficiency. However, existing research has demonstrated that a direct replacement of <b>CNN</b> backbone with linear projection leads to a marked performance drop. In this work, we resolve the issue by proposing a <b>self-supervised</b> <b>pre-training</b> (SSP) method for TSR <b>transformers.</b> We discover that the performance gap between the linear projection <b>transformer</b> and the hybrid <b>CNN-transformer</b> can be mitigated by SSP of the visual encoder in the TSR model. We conducted reproducible ablation studies and open-sourced our code at https://github.com/poloclub/unitable to enhance transparency, inspire innovations, and facilitate fair comparisons in our domain as tables are a promising modality for <b>representation</b> <b>learning.</b>

**ABSTRACT**  
Image denoising is probably the oldest and still one of the most active research topic in image processing. Many methodological concepts have been introduced in the past decades and have improved performances significantly in recent years, especially with the emergence of <b>convolutional</b> <b>neural</b> <b>networks</b> and <b>supervised</b> <b>deep</b> learning. In this paper, we propose a survey of guided tour of <b>supervised</b> <b>and</b> <b>unsupervised</b> <b>learning</b> methods for image denoising, classifying the main principles elaborated during this evolution, with a particular concern given to recent developments in <b>supervised</b> <b>learning.</b> It is conceived as a tutorial organizing in a comprehensive framework current approaches. We give insights on the rationales and limitations of the most performant methods in the literature, and we highlight the common features between many of them. Finally, we focus on on the normalization equivariance properties that is surprisingly not guaranteed with most of <b>supervised</b> <b>methods.</b> It is of paramount importance that intensity shifting or scaling applied to the input image results in a corresponding change in the denoiser output.

**ABSTRACT**  
Achieving resiliency against <b>adversarial</b> <b>attacks</b> is necessary prior to deploying neural network classifiers in domains where misclassification incurs substantial costs, e.g., self-driving cars or medical imaging. Recent work has demonstrated that robustness can be transferred from an adversarially trained teacher to a student model using <b>knowledge</b> <b>distillation.</b> However, current methods perform <b>distillation</b> using a single <b>adversarial</b> <b>and</b> vanilla teacher and consider homogeneous architectures (i.e., residual networks) that are susceptible to misclassify examples from similar <b>adversarial</b> <b>subspaces.</b> In this work, we develop a defense framework against <b>adversarial</b> <b>attacks</b> by <b>distilling</b> <b>adversarial</b> <b>robustness</b> using heterogeneous teachers (DARHT). In DARHT, the student model explicitly represents teacher logits in a student-teacher feature map and leverages multiple teachers that exhibit low <b>adversarial</b> <b>example</b> transferability (i.e., exhibit high performance on dissimilar <b>adversarial</b> <b>examples).</b> Experiments on classification tasks in both white-box and <b>black-box</b> <b>scenarios</b> demonstrate that DARHT achieves state-of-the-art clean and robust accuracies when compared to competing <b>adversarial</b> <b>training</b> and <b>distillation</b> methods in the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet datasets. Comparisons with homogeneous and heterogeneous teacher sets suggest that leveraging teachers with low <b>adversarial</b> <b>example</b> transferability increases student model robustness.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper explores the challenge of procedure planning in instructional videos, which involves creating goal-directed plans based on visual start and goal observations from videos. Previous research has tackled this problem with gradually weaker training supervision, from heavy intermediate visual observations or language instructions to task class supervision. However, with the advent of <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models,</b> even given only the task name, these models can produce a detailed plan. In this study, we propose a much weaker setting without task name as supervision, which is not currently solvable by existing <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> since they require good <b>prompts</b> with sufficient information. Specifically, we hypothesize that previous intermediate supervisions can serve as context information, and we use captions of visual start and goal observations as a much cheaper form of supervision. This approach greatly reduces the labeling cost since the captions can be easily obtained by <b>large</b> <b>pre-trained</b> <b>vision-language</b> <b>foundation</b> <b>models.</b> Technically, we apply BLIP to generate captions as supervision to train the context feature with <b>contrastive</b> <b>learning</b> loss. Afterward, the context feature is fed into the generator to aid in plan generation. Our experiments on two datasets with varying scales demonstrate that our model can achieve comparable performance on multiple metrics, which validates our hypothesis.

**ABSTRACT**  
Accurate segmentation of multiple organs in Computed Tomography (CT) images plays a vital role in computer-aided diagnosis systems. Various <b>supervised-learning</b> <b>approaches</b> have been proposed recently. However, these methods heavily depend on a large amount of high-quality labeled data, which is expensive to obtain in practice. In this study, we present a label-efficient learning approach using a pre-trained <b>diffusion</b> <b>model</b> for multi-organ segmentation tasks in CT images. First, a denoising <b>diffusion</b> <b>model</b> was trained using unlabeled CT data, generating additional two-dimensional (2D) CT images. Then the pre-trained denoising <b>diffusion</b> <b>network</b> was transferred to the downstream multi-organ segmentation task, effectively creating a <b>semi-supervised</b> <b>learning</b> model that requires only a small amount of labeled data. Furthermore, linear classification and <b>fine-tuning</b> decoder strategies were employed to enhance the network's segmentation performance. Our generative model at 256x256 resolution achieves impressive performance in terms of Fr\'echet inception distance, spatial Fr\'echet inception distance, and F1-score, with values of 11.32, 46.93, and 73.1\%, respectively. These results affirm the <b>diffusion</b> <b>model's</b> ability to generate diverse and realistic 2D CT images. Additionally, our method achieves competitive multi-organ segmentation performance compared to state-of-the-art methods on the FLARE 2022 dataset, particularly in limited labeled data scenarios. Remarkably, even with only 1\% and 10\% labeled data, our method achieves Dice similarity coefficients (DSCs) of 71.56\% and 78.51\% after <b>fine-tuning,</b> respectively. The method achieves a DSC score of 51.81\% using just four labeled CT scans. These results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in overcoming the limitations of <b>supervised</b> <b>learning</b> heavily reliant on large-scale labeled data.

**ABSTRACT**  
Contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) models have demonstrated considerable success across various <b>vision-language</b> tasks, such as <b>text-to-image</b> retrieval, where the model is required to effectively process natural language input to produce an accurate visual output. However, current models still face limitations in dealing with linguistic variations in input queries, such as paraphrases, making it challenging to handle a broad range of user queries in real-world applications. In this study, we introduce a straightforward <b>fine-tuning</b> approach to enhance the representations of CLIP models for paraphrases. Our approach involves a two-step paraphrase generation process, where we automatically create two categories of paraphrases from web-scale image captions by leveraging <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models.</b> Subsequently, we <b>fine-tune</b> the CLIP text encoder using these generated paraphrases while freezing the image encoder. Our resulting model, which we call ParaCLIP, exhibits significant improvements over baseline CLIP models across various tasks, including paraphrased retrieval (with rank similarity scores improved by up to 2.0% and 5.6%), Visual Genome Relation and Attribution, as well as seven semantic textual similarity tasks.

**ABSTRACT**  
The adoption of tablets with touchscreens and styluses is increasing, and a key feature is converting handwriting to text, enabling search, indexing, and AI assistance. Meanwhile, <b>vision-language</b> models (VLMs) are now the go-to solution for image understanding, thanks to both their state-of-the-art performance across a variety of tasks and the simplicity of a unified approach to training, <b>fine-tuning,</b> and inference. While VLMs obtain high performance on image-based tasks, they perform poorly on handwriting recognition when applied naively, i.e., by rendering handwriting as an image and performing <b>optical</b> <b>character</b> <b>recognition</b> <b>(OCR).</b> In this paper, we study online handwriting recognition with VLMs, going beyond naive <b>OCR.</b> We propose a novel tokenized representation of digital ink (online handwriting) that includes both a time-ordered sequence of strokes as text, and as image. We show that this representation yields results comparable to or better than state-of-the-art online handwriting recognizers. Wide applicability is shown through results with two different VLM families, on multiple public datasets. Our approach can be applied to off-the-shelf VLMs, does not require any changes in their architecture, and can be used in both <b>fine-tuning</b> and parameter-efficient tuning. We perform a detailed ablation study to identify the key elements of the proposed representation.

**ABSTRACT**  
Large <b>Vision-Language</b> Models (LVLMs) are susceptible to object hallucinations, an issue in which their generated <b>text</b> <b>contains</b> non-existent objects, greatly limiting their reliability and practicality. Current approaches often rely on the model's token likelihoods or other internal information, <b>instruction</b> <b>tuning</b> on additional datasets, or incorporating complex external tools. We first perform empirical analysis on sentence-level LVLM hallucination, finding that CLIP similarity to the image acts as a stronger and more robust indicator of hallucination compared to token likelihoods. Motivated by this, we introduce our CLIP-Guided Decoding (CGD) approach, a straightforward but effective training-free approach to reduce object hallucination at decoding time. CGD uses CLIP to guide the model's decoding process by enhancing visual <b>grounding</b> of generated <b>text</b> <b>with</b> the image. Experiments demonstrate that CGD effectively mitigates object hallucination across multiple LVLM families while preserving the utility of <b>text</b> <b>generation.</b>

**ABSTRACT**  
Deep learning models have been used for a variety of image processing tasks. However, most of these models are developed through <b>supervised</b> <b>learning</b> approaches, which rely heavily on the availability of large-scale annotated datasets. Developing such datasets is tedious and expensive. In the absence of an annotated dataset, synthetic data can be used for model development; however, due to the substantial differences between simulated and real data, a phenomenon referred to as domain gap, the resulting models often underperform when applied to real data. In this research, we aim to address this challenge by first computationally simulating a large-scale annotated dataset and then using a <b>generative</b> <b>adversarial</b> <b>network</b> <b>(GAN)</b> to fill the gap between simulated and real images. This approach results in a synthetic dataset that can be effectively utilized to train a deep-learning model. Using this approach, we developed a realistic annotated synthetic dataset for wheat head segmentation. This dataset was then used to develop a deep-learning model for semantic segmentation. The resulting model achieved a Dice score of 83.4\% on an internal dataset and Dice scores of 79.6% and 83.6% on two external Global Wheat Head Detection datasets. While we proposed this approach in the context of wheat head segmentation, it can be generalized to other crop types or, more broadly, to images with dense, repeated patterns such as those found in cellular imagery.

**ABSTRACT**  
Precise situational awareness is required for the safe decision-making of assisted and automated driving (AAD) functions. Panoptic segmentation is a promising perception technique to identify and categorise objects, impending hazards, and driveable space at a pixel level. While segmentation quality is generally associated with the quality of the camera data, a comprehensive understanding and modelling of this relationship are paramount for AAD system designers. Motivated by such a need, this work proposes a unifying pipeline to assess the robustness of panoptic segmentation models for AAD, correlating it with traditional image quality. The first step of the proposed pipeline involves generating degraded camera data that reflects real-world noise factors. To this end, 19 noise factors have been identified and implemented with 3 severity levels. Of these factors, this work proposes novel models for unfavourable light and snow. After applying the degradation models, three state-of-the-art CNN- and <b>vision</b> <b>transformers</b> (ViT)-based panoptic segmentation networks are used to analyse their robustness. The variations of the segmentation performance are then correlated to 8 selected image quality metrics. This research reveals that: 1) certain specific noise factors produce the highest impact on panoptic segmentation, i.e. droplets on lens and Gaussian noise; 2) the ViT-based panoptic segmentation backbones show better robustness to the considered noise factors; 3) some image quality metrics (i.e. LPIPS and CW-SSIM) correlate strongly with panoptic segmentation performance and therefore they can be used as predictive metrics for network performance.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> <b>(LLMs)</b> have achieved superior performance in powering text-based AI agents, endowing them with decision-making and <b>reasoning</b> abilities akin to humans. Concurrently, there is an emerging research trend focused on extending these <b>LLM-powered</b> AI agents into the <b>multimodal</b> domain. This extension enables AI agents to interpret and respond to diverse <b>multimodal</b> user queries, thereby handling more intricate and nuanced tasks. In this paper, we conduct a systematic review of <b>LLM-driven</b> <b>multimodal</b> agents, which we refer to as <b>large</b> <b>multimodal</b> <b>agents</b> ( LMAs for short). First, we introduce the essential components involved in developing LMAs and categorize the current body of research into four distinct types. Subsequently, we review the collaborative frameworks integrating multiple LMAs , enhancing collective efficacy. One of the critical challenges in this field is the diverse evaluation methods used across existing studies, hindering effective comparison among different LMAs . Therefore, we compile these evaluation methodologies and establish a comprehensive framework to bridge the gaps. This framework aims to standardize evaluations, facilitating more meaningful comparisons. Concluding our review, we highlight the extensive applications of LMAs and propose possible future research directions. Our discussion aims to provide valuable insights and guidelines for future research in this rapidly evolving field.

**ABSTRACT**  
While <b>convolutional</b> <b>neural</b> <b>networks</b> <b>(CNNs)</b> have achieved success in computer vision tasks, it is vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Such attacks could mislead the victim model to make attacker-chosen prediction with a specific trigger pattern. Until now, the trigger injection of existing attacks is mainly limited to spatial domain. Recent works take advantage of perceptual properties of planting specific patterns in the frequency domain, which only reflect indistinguishable pixel-wise perturbations in pixel domain. However, in the <b>black-box</b> <b>setup,</b> the inaccessibility of training process often renders more complex trigger designs. Existing frequency attacks simply handcraft the magnitude of spectrum, introducing anomaly frequency disparities between clean and poisoned data and taking risks of being removed by image processing operations (such as lossy compression and filtering). In this paper, we propose a robust low-frequency <b>black-box</b> <b>backdoor</b> attack (LFBA), which minimally perturbs low-frequency components of frequency spectrum and maintains the perceptual similarity in spatial space simultaneously. The key insight of our attack restrict the search for the optimal trigger to low-frequency region that can achieve high attack effectiveness, robustness against image transformation defenses and stealthiness in dual space. We utilize simulated annealing (SA), a form of evolutionary algorithm, to optimize the properties of frequency trigger including the number of manipulated frequency bands and the perturbation of each frequency component, without relying on the knowledge from the victim classifier. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets verify the effectiveness and robustness of LFBA against image processing operations and the state-of-the-art backdoor defenses, as well as its inherent stealthiness in both spatial and frequency space, making it resilient against frequency inspection.

**ABSTRACT**  
Due to the lack of depth cues in images, multi-frame inputs are important for the success of vision-based perception, prediction, and planning in autonomous driving. Observations from different angles enable the recovery of 3D object states from 2D image inputs if we can identify the same instance in different input frames. However, the dynamic nature of autonomous driving scenes leads to significant changes in the appearance and shape of each instance captured by the camera at different time steps. To this end, we propose a novel <b>contrastive</b> <b>learning</b> algorithm, Cohere3D, to learn coherent instance <b>representations</b> <b>in</b> a long-term input sequence robust to the change in distance and perspective. The learned <b>representation</b> <b>aids</b> in instance-level correspondence across multiple input frames in downstream tasks. In the pretraining stage, the raw point clouds from LiDAR sensors are utilized to construct the long-term temporal correspondence for each instance, which serves as guidance for the extraction of instance-level <b>representation</b> <b>from</b> the vision-based bird's eye-view (BEV) feature map. Cohere3D encourages a consistent <b>representation</b> <b>for</b> the same instance at different frames but distinguishes between <b>representations</b> <b>of</b> different instances. We evaluate our algorithm by <b>finetuning</b> the pretrained model on various downstream perception, prediction, and planning tasks. Results show a notable improvement in both data efficiency and task performance.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recent years have witnessed great progress in image restoration thanks to the advancements in modern deep neural networks e.g. <b>Convolutional</b> <b>Neural</b> <b>Network</b> and <b>Transformer.</b> However, existing restoration backbones are usually limited due to the inherent local reductive bias or quadratic computational complexity. Recently, Selective Structured State Space Model e.g., Mamba, has shown great potential for long-range dependencies modeling with linear complexity, but it is still under-explored in low-level computer vision. In this work, we introduce a simple but strong <b>benchmark</b> model, named MambaIR, for image restoration. In detail, we propose the Residual State Space Block as the core component, which employs <b>convolution</b> and channel attention to enhance the capabilities of the vanilla Mamba. In this way, our MambaIR takes advantage of local patch recurrence prior as well as channel interaction to produce restoration-specific feature representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method, for example, MambaIR outperforms <b>Transformer-based</b> baseline SwinIR by up to 0.36dB, using similar computational cost but with a global receptive field. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/csguoh/MambaIR}.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recent <b>text-to-image</b> <b>diffusion</b> <b>models</b> are able to learn and synthesize images containing novel, personalized concepts (e.g., their own pets or specific items) with just a few examples for training. This paper tackles two interconnected issues within this realm of personalizing <b>text-to-image</b> <b>diffusion</b> <b>models.</b> First, current personalization techniques fail to reliably extend to multiple concepts -- we hypothesize this to be due to the mismatch between complex scenes and simple text descriptions in the pre-training dataset (e.g., LAION). Second, given an image containing multiple personalized concepts, there lacks a holistic metric that evaluates performance on not just the degree of resemblance of personalized concepts, but also whether all concepts are present in the image and whether the image accurately reflects the overall text description. To address these issues, we introduce Gen4Gen, a semi-automated dataset creation pipeline utilizing generative models to combine personalized concepts into complex compositions along with text-descriptions. Using this, we create a dataset called MyCanvas, that can be used to <b>benchmark</b> the task of multi-concept personalization. In addition, we design a comprehensive metric comprising two scores (CP-CLIP and TI-CLIP) for better quantifying the performance of multi-concept, personalized <b>text-to-image</b> <b>diffusion</b> <b>methods.</b> We provide a simple baseline built on top of Custom <b>Diffusion</b> <b>with</b> empirical <b>prompting</b> strategies for future researchers to evaluate on MyCanvas. We show that by improving data quality and <b>prompting</b> strategies, we can significantly increase multi-concept personalized image generation quality, without requiring any modifications to model architecture or training algorithms.

**ABSTRACT**  
In visual <b>speech</b> <b>processing,</b> context modeling capability is one of the most important requirements due to the ambiguous nature of lip movements. For example, homophenes, words that share identical lip movements but produce different sounds, can be distinguished by considering the context. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, namely Visual <b>Speech</b> <b>Processing</b> incorporated with <b>LLMs</b> (VSP-LLM), to maximize the context modeling ability by bringing the overwhelming power of <b>LLMs.</b> Specifically, VSP-LLM is designed to perform multi-tasks of visual <b>speech</b> <b>recognition</b> and translation, where the given instructions control the type of task. The input video is mapped to the input latent space of a <b>LLM</b> by employing a <b>self-supervised</b> visual <b>speech</b> <b>model.</b> Focused on the fact that there is redundant information in input frames, we propose a novel deduplication method that reduces the embedded visual features by employing visual <b>speech</b> <b>units.</b> Through the proposed deduplication and Low Rank Adaptors (LoRA), VSP-LLM can be trained in a computationally efficient manner. In the translation dataset, the MuAViC <b>benchmark,</b> we demonstrate that VSP-LLM can more effectively recognize and translate lip movements with just 15 hours of labeled data, compared to the recent translation model trained with 433 hours of labeld data.

**ABSTRACT**  
Foveated vision, a trait shared by many animals, including humans, has not been fully utilized in machine learning applications, despite its significant contributions to biological visual function. This study investigates whether retinotopic mapping, a critical component of foveated vision, can enhance image categorization and localization performance when integrated into deep <b>convolutional</b> <b>neural</b> <b>networks</b> <b>(CNNs).</b> Retinotopic mapping was integrated into the inputs of standard off-the-shelf <b>convolutional</b> <b>neural</b> <b>networks</b> <b>(CNNs),</b> which were then retrained on the ImageNet task. As expected, the logarithmic-polar mapping improved the network's ability to handle arbitrary image zooms and rotations, particularly for isolated objects. Surprisingly, the retinotopically mapped network achieved comparable performance in classification. Furthermore, the network demonstrated improved classification localization when the foveated center of the transform was shifted. This replicates a crucial ability of the human visual system that is absent in typical <b>convolutional</b> <b>neural</b> <b>networks</b> <b>(CNNs).</b> These findings suggest that retinotopic mapping may be fundamental to significant preattentive visual processes.

**ABSTRACT**  
Developing robust and interpretable vision systems is a crucial step towards trustworthy artificial intelligence. In this regard, a promising paradigm considers embedding task-required invariant structures, e.g., geometric invariance, in the fundamental image representation. However, such invariant representations typically exhibit limited discriminability, limiting their applications in larger-scale trustworthy vision tasks. For this open problem, we conduct a systematic investigation of hierarchical invariance, exploring this topic from theoretical, practical, and application perspectives. At the theoretical level, we show how to construct over-complete invariants with a <b>Convolutional</b> <b>Neural</b> <b>Networks</b> <b>(CNN)-like</b> hierarchical architecture yet in a fully interpretable manner. The general blueprint, specific definitions, invariant properties, and numerical implementations are provided. At the practical level, we discuss how to customize this theoretical framework into a given task. With the over-completeness, discriminative features w.r.t. the task can be adaptively formed in a Neural Architecture Search (NAS)-like manner. We demonstrate the above arguments with accuracy, invariance, and efficiency results on texture, digit, and parasite classification experiments. Furthermore, at the application level, our representations are explored in real-world forensics tasks on adversarial perturbations and Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC). Such applications reveal that the proposed strategy not only realizes the theoretically promised invariance, but also exhibits competitive discriminability even in the era of deep learning. For robust and interpretable vision tasks at larger scales, hierarchical invariant representation can be considered as an effective alternative to traditional <b>CNN</b> and invariants.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper focuses on semi-supervised crowd counting, where only a small portion of the training data are labeled. We formulate the pixel-wise density value to regress as a probability distribution, instead of a single deterministic value. On this basis, we propose a semi-supervised crowd-counting model. Firstly, we design a pixel-wise distribution matching loss to measure the differences in the pixel-wise density distributions between the prediction and the ground truth; Secondly, we enhance the <b>transformer</b> decoder by using density tokens to specialize the forwards of decoders w.r.t. different density intervals; Thirdly, we design the interleaving consistency <b>self-supervised</b> <b>learning</b> mechanism to learn from unlabeled data efficiently. Extensive experiments on four datasets are performed to show that our method clearly outperforms the competitors by a large margin under various labeled ratio settings. Code will be released at https://github.com/LoraLinH/Semi-supervised-Counting-via-Pixel-by-pixel-Density-Distribution-Modelling.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Unsupervised</b> <b>domain</b> <b>adaptation</b> (UDA) aims to align the labelled source distribution with the unlabelled target distribution to obtain <b>domain-invariant</b> <b>predictive</b> models. Since cross-modality medical data exhibit significant intra and inter-domain shifts and most are unlabelled, UDA is more important while challenging in medical image analysis. This paper proposes a simple yet potent <b>contrastive</b> <b>learning</b> framework for UDA to narrow the inter-domain gap between labelled source and unlabelled target distribution. Our method is validated on cerebral vessel datasets. Experimental results show that our approach can learn latent features from labelled 3DRA modality data and improve vessel segmentation performance in unlabelled MRA modality data.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper addresses the challenging task of estimating font impressions from real font images. We use a font dataset with annotation about font impressions and a <b>convolutional</b> <b>neural</b> <b>network</b> <b>(CNN)</b> framework for this task. However, impressions attached to individual fonts are often missing and noisy because of the subjective characteristic of font impression annotation. To realize stable impression estimation even with such a dataset, we propose an exemplar-based impression estimation approach, which relies on a strategy of ensembling impressions of exemplar fonts that are similar to the input image. In addition, we train <b>CNN</b> with synthetic font images that mimic scanned word images so that <b>CNN</b> estimates impressions of font images in the wild. We evaluate the basic performance of the proposed estimation method quantitatively and qualitatively. Then, we conduct a correlation analysis between book genres and font impressions on real book cover images; it is important to note that this analysis is only possible with our impression estimation method. The analysis reveals various trends in the correlation between them - this fact supports a hypothesis that book cover designers carefully choose a font for a book cover considering the impression given by the font.

**ABSTRACT**  
Often, applications of <b>self-supervised</b> <b>learning</b> to 3D medical data opt to use 3D variants of successful 2D network architectures. Although promising approaches, they are significantly more computationally demanding to train, and thus reduce the widespread applicability of these methods away from those with modest computational resources. Thus, in this paper, we aim to improve standard 2D SSL algorithms by modelling the inherent 3D nature of these datasets implicitly. We propose two variants that build upon a strong baseline model and show that both of these variants often outperform the baseline in a variety of downstream tasks. Importantly, in contrast to previous works in both 2D and 3D approaches for 3D medical data, both of our proposals introduce negligible additional overhead over the baseline, improving the democratisation of these approaches for medical applications.

Today, state-of-the-art deep neural networks that process event-camera data first convert a temporal window of events into dense, grid-like input representations. As such, they exhibit poor generalizability when deployed at higher inference frequencies (i.e., smaller temporal windows) than the ones they were trained on. We address this challenge by introducing state-space models (SSMs) with learnable timescale parameters to event-based vision. This design adapts to varying frequencies without the need to retrain the network at different frequencies. Additionally, we investigate two strategies to counteract aliasing effects when deploying the model at higher frequencies. We comprehensively evaluate our approach against existing methods based on <b>RNN</b> and <b>Transformer</b> architectures across various <b>benchmarks,</b> including Gen1 and 1 Mpx event camera datasets. Our results demonstrate that SSM-based models train 33% faster and also exhibit minimal performance degradation when tested at higher frequencies than the training input. Traditional <b>RNN</b> and <b>Transformer</b> models exhibit performance drops of more than 20 mAP, with SSMs having a drop of 3.31 mAP, highlighting the effectiveness of SSMs in event-based vision tasks.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Outlier</b> <b>detection</b> is an essential capability in safety-critical applications of <b>supervised</b> visual recognition. Most of the existing methods deliver best results by encouraging standard closed-set models to produce low-confidence predictions in negative training data. However, that approach conflates prediction uncertainty with recognition of the negative class. We therefore reconsider direct prediction of K+1 logits that correspond to K groundtruth classes and one <b>outlier</b> <b>class.</b> This setup allows us to formulate a novel anomaly score as an ensemble of in-distribution uncertainty and the posterior of the <b>outlier</b> <b>class</b> which we term negative objectness. Now <b>outliers</b> <b>can</b> be independently detected due to i) high prediction uncertainty or ii) similarity with negative data. We embed our method into a dense prediction architecture with mask-level recognition over K+2 classes. The training procedure encourages the novel K+2-th class to learn negative objectness at pasted negative instances. Our models outperform the current state-of-the art on standard <b>benchmarks</b> for image-wide and pixel-level <b>outlier</b> <b>detection</b> with and without training on real negative data.

**ABSTRACT**  
Online <b>Unsupervised</b> <b>Domain</b> <b>Adaptation</b> (OUDA) for person Re-Identification (Re-ID) is the task of continuously adapting a model trained on a well-annotated source <b>domain</b> <b>dataset</b> to a target <b>domain</b> <b>observed</b> as a data stream. In OUDA, person Re-ID models face two main challenges: catastrophic forgetting and <b>domain</b> <b>shift.</b> In this work, we propose a new Source-guided Similarity Preservation (S2P) framework to alleviate these two problems. Our framework is based on the extraction of a support set composed of source images that maximizes the similarity with the target data. This support set is used to identify feature similarities that must be preserved during the learning process. S2P can incorporate multiple existing UDA methods to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Our experiments show that S2P outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on multiple real-to-real and synthetic-to-real challenging OUDA <b>benchmarks.</b>

**ABSTRACT**  
Masked <b>autoencoders</b> (MAEs) have established themselves as a powerful method for <b>unsupervised</b> pre-training for computer vision tasks. While vanilla MAEs put equal emphasis on reconstructing the individual parts of the image, we propose to inform the reconstruction process through an attention-guided loss function. By leveraging advances in <b>unsupervised</b> object discovery, we obtain an attention map of the scene which we employ in the loss function to put increased emphasis on reconstructing relevant objects, thus effectively incentivizing the model to learn more object-focused representations without compromising the established masking strategy. Our evaluations show that our pre-trained models learn better latent representations than the vanilla MAE, demonstrated by improved linear probing and k-NN classification results on several <b>benchmarks</b> while at the same time making ViTs more robust against varying backgrounds.

**ABSTRACT**  
Deep learning methods have led to significant improvements in the performance on the facial landmark detection (FLD) task. However, detecting landmarks in challenging settings, such as head pose changes, exaggerated expressions, or uneven illumination, continue to remain a challenge due to high variability and insufficient samples. This inadequacy can be attributed to the model's inability to effectively acquire appropriate facial structure information from the input images. To address this, we propose a novel image augmentation technique specifically designed for the FLD task to enhance the model's understanding of facial structures. To effectively utilize the newly proposed augmentation technique, we employ a Siamese architecture-based training mechanism with a Deep Canonical Correlation Analysis (DCCA)-based loss to achieve collective learning of high-level feature representations from two different views of the input images. Furthermore, we employ a <b>Transformer</b> + <b>CNN-based</b> network with a custom hourglass module as the robust backbone for the Siamese framework. Extensive experiments show that our approach outperforms multiple state-of-the-art approaches across various <b>benchmark</b> datasets.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Text-to-Image</b> (T2I) <b>Diffusion</b> <b>Models</b> (DMs) have shown impressive abilities in generating high-quality images based on simple text descriptions. However, as is common with many Deep Learning (DL) models, DMs are subject to a lack of robustness. While there are attempts to evaluate the robustness of T2I DMs as a binary or worst-case problem, they cannot answer how robust in general the model is whenever an adversarial example (AE) can be found. In this study, we first introduce a probabilistic notion of T2I DMs' robustness; and then establish an efficient framework, ProTIP, to evaluate it with statistical guarantees. The main challenges stem from: i) the high computational cost of the generation process; and ii) determining if a perturbed input is an AE involves comparing two output distributions, which is fundamentally harder compared to other DL tasks like classification where an AE is identified upon misprediction of labels. To tackle the challenges, we employ sequential analysis with efficacy and futility early stopping rules in the statistical testing for identifying AEs, and adaptive concentration inequalities to dynamically determine the "just-right" number of stochastic perturbations whenever the verification target is met. Empirical experiments validate the effectiveness and efficiency of ProTIP over common T2I DMs. Finally, we demonstrate an application of ProTIP to rank commonly used defence methods.

**ABSTRACT**  
Developing an accurate and fast <b>anomaly</b> <b>detection</b> model is an important task in real-time computer vision applications. There has been much research to develop a single model that detects either structural or logical anomalies, which are inherently distinct. The majority of the existing approaches implicitly assume that the <b>anomaly</b> <b>can</b> be represented by identifying the anomalous location. However, we argue that logical anomalies, such as the wrong number of objects, can not be well-represented by the spatial feature maps and require an alternative approach. In addition, we focused on the possibility of detecting logical anomalies by using an <b>out-of-distribution</b> detection approach on the feature space, which aggregates the spatial information of the feature map. As a demonstration, we propose a method that incorporates a simple <b>out-of-distribution</b> detection method on the feature space against state-of-the-art reconstruction-based approaches. Despite the simplicity of our proposal, our method PUAD (Picturable and Unpicturable <b>Anomaly</b> <b>Detection)</b> achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MVTec LOCO AD dataset.

**ABSTRACT**  
The identification and characterization of various rock types is one of the fundamental activities for geology and related areas such as mining, petroleum, environment, industry and construction. Traditionally, a human specialist is responsible for analyzing and explaining details about the type, composition, texture, shape and other properties using rock samples collected in-situ or prepared in a laboratory. The results become subjective based on experience, in addition to consuming a large investment of time and effort. The present proposal uses artificial intelligence techniques combining computer vision and natural language processing to generate a textual and verbal description from a thin section image of rock. We build a dataset of images and their respective textual descriptions for the training of a model that associates the relevant features of the image extracted by EfficientNetB7 with the textual description generated by a <b>Transformer</b> network, reaching an accuracy value of 0.892 and a <b>BLEU</b> value of 0.71. This model can be a useful resource for research, professional and academic work, so it has been deployed through a Web application for public use.

**ABSTRACT**  
The roto-translation group SE2 has been of active interest in image analysis due to methods that lift the image data to multi-orientation representations defined on this Lie group. This has led to impactful applications of crossing-preserving flows for image de-noising, geodesic tracking, and roto-translation equivariant deep learning. In this paper, we develop a computational framework for optimal transportation over Lie groups, with a special focus on SE2. We make several theoretical contributions (generalizable to matrix Lie groups) such as the non-optimality of group actions as transport maps, invariance and equivariance of optimal transport, and the quality of the entropic-regularized optimal transport plan using geodesic distance approximations. We develop a Sinkhorn like algorithm that can be efficiently implemented using fast and accurate distance approximations of the Lie group and GPU-friendly group <b>convolutions.</b> We report valuable advancements in the experiments on 1) image barycenters, 2) interpolation of planar orientation fields, and 3) Wasserstein gradient flows on SE2. We observe that our framework of lifting images to SE2 and optimal transport with left-invariant anisotropic metrics leads to equivariant transport along dominant contours and salient line structures in the image. This yields sharper and more meaningful interpolations compared to their counterparts on $\mathbb{R}^2$

**ABSTRACT**  
In autonomous driving, cooperative perception makes use of multi-view cameras from both vehicles and infrastructure, providing a global vantage point with rich semantic context of road conditions beyond a single vehicle viewpoint. Currently, two major challenges persist in vehicle-infrastructure cooperative 3D (VIC3D) <b>object</b> <b>detection:</b> $1)$ inherent pose errors when fusing multi-view images, caused by time asynchrony across cameras; $2)$ information loss in transmission process resulted from limited communication bandwidth. To address these issues, we propose a novel camera-based 3D detection framework for VIC3D task, Enhanced Multi-scale Image Feature Fusion (EMIFF). To fully exploit holistic perspectives from both vehicles and infrastructure, we propose Multi-scale Cross Attention (MCA) and Camera-aware Channel Masking (CCM) modules to enhance infrastructure and vehicle features at scale, spatial, and channel levels to correct the pose error introduced by camera asynchrony. We also introduce a Feature Compression (FC) module with channel and spatial compression blocks for transmission efficiency. Experiments show that EMIFF achieves SOTA on DAIR-V2X-C datasets, significantly outperforming previous early-fusion and late-fusion methods with comparable transmission costs.

**ABSTRACT**  
The automated segmentation of cerebral aneurysms is pivotal for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning. Confronted with significant domain shifts and class imbalance in 3D Rotational Angiography (3DRA) data from various medical institutions, the task becomes challenging. These shifts include differences in image appearance, intensity distribution, resolution, and aneurysm size, all of which complicate the segmentation process. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel domain generalization strategy that employs gradient surgery exponential moving average (GS-EMA) optimization technique coupled with boundary-aware <b>contrastive</b> <b>learning</b> (BACL). Our approach is distinct in its ability to adapt to new, unseen domains by learning domain-invariant features, thereby improving the robustness and accuracy of aneurysm segmentation across diverse clinical datasets. The results demonstrate that our proposed approach can extract more domain-invariant features, minimizing over-segmentation and capturing more complete aneurysm structures.

**ABSTRACT**  
Preference-based <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning</b> (RL) has emerged as a new field in robot learning, where humans play a pivotal role in shaping robot behavior by expressing preferences on different sequences of state-action pairs. However, formulating realistic policies for robots demands responses from humans to an extensive array of queries. In this work, we approach the sample-efficiency challenge by expanding the information collected per query to contain both preferences and optional text <b>prompting.</b> To accomplish this, we leverage the <b>zero-shot</b> capabilities of a <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>model</b> <b>(LLM)</b> to reason from the text provided by humans. To accommodate the additional query information, we reformulate the reward learning objectives to contain flexible highlights -- state-action pairs that contain relatively high information and are related to the features processed in a <b>zero-shot</b> fashion from a pretrained <b>LLM.</b> In both a simulated scenario and a user study, we reveal the effectiveness of our work by analyzing the feedback and its implications. Additionally, the collective feedback collected serves to train a robot on socially compliant trajectories in a simulated social navigation landscape.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper addresses task planning problems for language-instructed robot teams. Tasks are expressed in natural language (NL), requiring the robots to apply their capabilities (e.g., mobility, manipulation, and sensing) at various locations and semantic objects. Several recent works have addressed similar planning problems by leveraging pre-trained <b>Large</b> <b>Language</b> <b>Models</b> <b>(LLMs)</b> to design effective multi-robot plans. However, these approaches lack mission performance and safety guarantees. To address this challenge, we introduce a new decentralized <b>LLM-based</b> planner that is capable of achieving high mission success rates. This is accomplished by leveraging conformal prediction (CP), a distribution-free uncertainty quantification tool in <b>black-box</b> <b>models.</b> CP allows the proposed multi-robot planner to reason about its inherent uncertainty in a decentralized fashion, enabling robots to make individual decisions when they are sufficiently certain and seek help otherwise. We show, both theoretically and empirically, that the proposed planner can achieve user-specified task success rates while minimizing the overall number of help requests. We demonstrate the performance of our approach on multi-robot home service applications. We also show through comparative experiments, that our method outperforms recent centralized and decentralized multi-robot <b>LLM-based</b> planners in terms of in terms of its ability to design correct plans. The advantage of our algorithm over baselines becomes more pronounced with increasing mission complexity and robot team size.

**ABSTRACT**  
Robots need to explore their surroundings to adapt to and tackle tasks in unknown environments. Prior work has proposed building scene <b>graphs</b> of the environment but typically assumes that the environment is static, omitting regions that require active interactions. This severely limits their ability to handle more complex tasks in household and office environments: before setting up a table, robots must explore drawers and cabinets to locate all utensils and condiments. In this work, we introduce the novel task of interactive scene exploration, wherein robots autonomously explore environments and produce an action-conditioned scene <b>graph</b> (ACSG) that captures the structure of the underlying environment. The ACSG accounts for both low-level information, such as <b>geometry</b> and semantics, and high-level information, such as the action-conditioned relationships between different entities in the scene. To this end, we present the Robotic Exploration (RoboEXP) system, which incorporates the Large <b>Multimodal</b> Model (LMM) and an explicit memory design to enhance our system's capabilities. The robot reasons about what and how to explore an object, accumulating new information through the interaction process and incrementally constructing the ACSG. We apply our system across various real-world settings in a <b>zero-shot</b> manner, demonstrating its effectiveness in exploring and modeling environments it has never seen before. Leveraging the constructed ACSG, we illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our RoboEXP system in facilitating a wide range of real-world manipulation tasks involving rigid, articulated objects, nested objects like Matryoshka dolls, and deformable objects like cloth.

**ABSTRACT**  
We present Dynamics-Guided <b>Diffusion</b> <b>Model,</b> a data-driven framework for generating manipulator <b>geometry</b> designs for a given manipulation task. Instead of training different design models for each task, our approach employs a learned dynamics network shared across tasks. For a new manipulation task, we first decompose it into a collection of individual motion targets which we call target interaction profile, where each individual motion can be modeled by the shared dynamics network. The design objective constructed from the target and predicted interaction profiles provides a gradient to guide the refinement of finger <b>geometry</b> for the task. This refinement process is executed as a classifier-guided <b>diffusion</b> <b>process,</b> where the design objective acts as the classifier guidance. We evaluate our framework on various manipulation tasks, under the sensor-less setting using only an open-loop parallel jaw motion. Our generated designs outperform optimization-based and unguided <b>diffusion</b> <b>baselines</b> relatively by 31.5% and 45.3% on average manipulation success rate. With the ability to generate a design within 0.8 seconds, our framework could facilitate rapid design iteration and enhance the adoption of data-driven approaches for robotic mechanism design.

**ABSTRACT**  
We present a comprehensive framework for studying and leveraging morphological symmetries in robotic systems. These are intrinsic properties of the robot's morphology, frequently observed in animal biology and robotics, which stem from the replication of kinematic structures and the symmetrical distribution of mass. We illustrate how these symmetries extend to the robot's state space and both proprioceptive and exteroceptive sensor measurements, resulting in the equivariance of the robot's equations of motion and optimal control policies. Thus, we recognize morphological symmetries as a relevant and previously unexplored physics-informed geometric prior, with significant implications for both <b>data-driven</b> <b>and</b> analytical methods used in modeling, control, estimation and design in robotics. For <b>data-driven</b> <b>methods,</b> we demonstrate that morphological symmetries can enhance the sample efficiency and generalization of machine learning models through <b>data</b> <b>augmentation,</b> or by applying equivariant/invariant constraints on the model's architecture. In the context of analytical methods, we employ abstract harmonic analysis to decompose the robot's dynamics into a superposition of lower-dimensional, independent dynamics. We substantiate our claims with both synthetic and real-world experiments conducted on bipedal and quadrupedal robots. Lastly, we introduce the repository MorphoSymm to facilitate the practical use of the theory and applications outlined in this work.

**ABSTRACT**  
We focus on the task of unknown object rearrangement, where a robot is supposed to re-configure the objects into a desired goal configuration specified by an RGB-D image. Recent works explore unknown object rearrangement systems by incorporating learning-based perception modules. However, they are sensitive to perception error, and pay less attention to task-level performance. In this paper, we aim to develop an effective system for unknown object rearrangement amidst perception noise. We theoretically reveal the noisy perception impacts grasp and place in a decoupled way, and show such a decoupled structure is non-trivial to improve task optimality. We propose GSP, a dual-loop system with the decoupled structure as prior. For the inner loop, we learn an active seeing policy for self-confident object matching to improve the perception of place. For the outer loop, we learn a grasp policy aware of object matching and grasp capability guided by task-level rewards. We leverage the <b>foundation</b> <b>model</b> CLIP for object matching, policy learning and self-termination. A series of experiments indicate that GSP can conduct unknown object rearrangement with higher completion rate and less steps.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this study, we address the off-road traversability estimation problem, that predicts areas where a robot can navigate in off-road environments. An off-road environment is an unstructured environment comprising a combination of traversable and non-traversable spaces, which presents a challenge for estimating traversability. This study highlights three primary factors that affect a robot's traversability in an off-road environment: surface slope, semantic information, and robot platform. We present two strategies for estimating traversability, using a guide filter network (GFN) and footprint supervision module (FSM). The first strategy involves building a novel GFN using a newly designed guide filter layer. The GFN interprets the surface and semantic information from the input data and integrates them to extract features optimized for traversability estimation. The second strategy involves developing an FSM, which is a self-supervision module that utilizes the path traversed by the robot in pre-driving, also known as a footprint. This enables the prediction of traversability that reflects the characteristics of the robot platform. Based on these two strategies, the proposed method overcomes the limitations of existing methods, which require laborious human supervision and lack scalability. Extensive experiments in diverse conditions, including automobiles and unmanned ground vehicles, herbfields, woodlands, and farmlands, demonstrate that the proposed method is compatible for various robot platforms and adaptable to a range of terrains.

**ABSTRACT**  
We present the Streaming <b>Gaussian</b> <b>Dirichlet</b> Random Field (S-GDRF) model, a novel approach for modeling a stream of spatiotemporally distributed, sparse, high-dimensional categorical observations. The proposed approach efficiently learns global and local patterns in spatiotemporal data, allowing for fast inference and querying with a bounded time complexity. Using a high-resolution data series of plankton images classified with a neural network, we demonstrate the ability of the approach to make more accurate predictions compared to a Variational <b>Gaussian</b> <b>Process</b> (VGP), and to learn a predictive distribution of observations from streaming categorical data. S-GDRFs open the door to enabling efficient informative path planning over high-dimensional categorical observations, which until now has not been feasible.

**ABSTRACT**  
We present CLIPPER+, an algorithm for finding maximal cliques in unweighted <b>graphs</b> for outlier-robust global registration. The registration problem can be formulated as a <b>graph</b> and solved by finding its maximum clique. This formulation leads to extreme robustness to outliers; however, finding the maximum clique is an NP-hard problem, and therefore approximation is required in practice for large-size problems. The performance of an approximation algorithm is evaluated by its computational complexity (the lower the runtime, the better) and solution accuracy (how close the solution is to the maximum clique). Accordingly, the main contribution of CLIPPER+ is outperforming the state-of-the-art in accuracy while maintaining a relatively low runtime. CLIPPER+ builds on prior work (CLIPPER [1] and PMC [2]) and prunes the <b>graph</b> by removing vertices that have a small core number and cannot be a part of the maximum clique. This will result in a smaller <b>graph,</b> on which the maximum clique can be estimated considerably faster. We evaluate the performance of CLIPPER+ on standard <b>graph</b> <b>benchmarks,</b> as well as synthetic and real-world point cloud registration problems. These evaluations demonstrate that CLIPPER+ has the highest accuracy and can register point clouds in scenarios where over $99\%$ of associations are outliers. Our code and evaluation <b>benchmarks</b> are released at https://github.com/ariarobotics/clipperp.

**ABSTRACT**  
Collision detection is one of the most time-consuming operations during motion planning. Thus, there is an increasing interest in exploring machine learning techniques to speed up collision detection and sampling-based motion planning. A recent line of research focuses on utilizing neural signed distance functions of either the robot <b>geometry</b> or the swept volume of the robot motion. Building on this, we present a novel neural implicit swept volume model to continuously represent arbitrary motions parameterized by their start and goal configurations. This allows to quickly compute signed distances for any point in the task space to the robot motion. Further, we present an algorithm combining the speed of the deep learning-based signed distance computations with the strong accuracy guarantees of geometric collision checkers. We validate our approach in simulated and real-world robotic experiments, and demonstrate that it is able to speed up a commercial bin picking application.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Recommendation</b> systems for Web content distribution intricately connect to the information access and exposure opportunities for vulnerable populations. The emergence of <b>Large</b> <b>Language</b> <b>Models-based</b> <b>Recommendation</b> System (LRS) may introduce additional societal challenges to <b>recommendation</b> systems due to the inherent biases in <b>Large</b> <b>Language</b> <b>Models</b> <b>(LLMs).</b> From the perspective of item-side <b>fairness,</b> there remains a lack of comprehensive investigation into the item-side <b>fairness</b> of LRS given the unique characteristics of LRS compared to conventional <b>recommendation</b> systems. To bridge this gap, this study examines the property of LRS with respect to item-side <b>fairness</b> and reveals the influencing factors of both historical users' interactions and inherent semantic biases of <b>LLMs,</b> shedding light on the need to extend conventional item-side <b>fairness</b> methods for LRS. Towards this goal, we develop a concise and effective framework called IFairLRS to enhance the item-side <b>fairness</b> of an LRS. IFairLRS covers the main stages of building an LRS with specifically adapted strategies to calibrate the <b>recommendations</b> of LRS. We utilize IFairLRS to <b>fine-tune</b> <b>LLaMA,</b> a representative <b>LLM,</b> on \textit{MovieLens} and \textit{Steam} datasets, and observe significant item-side <b>fairness</b> improvements. The code can be found in https://github.com/JiangM-C/IFairLRS.git.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>LLM-based</b> agents have gained considerable attention for their decision-making skills and ability to handle complex tasks. Recognizing the current gap in leveraging agent capabilities for multi-agent collaboration in <b>recommendation</b> systems, we introduce MACRec, a novel framework designed to enhance <b>recommendation</b> systems through multi-agent collaboration. Unlike existing work on using agents for user/item <b>simulation,</b> we aim to deploy multi-agents to tackle <b>recommendation</b> tasks directly. In our framework, <b>recommendation</b> tasks are addressed through the collaborative efforts of various specialized agents, including Manager, User/Item Analyst, Reflector, Searcher, and Task Interpreter, with different working flows. Furthermore, we provide application examples of how developers can easily use MACRec on various <b>recommendation</b> tasks, including rating prediction, sequential <b>recommendation,</b> conversational <b>recommendation,</b> and explanation generation of <b>recommendation</b> results. The framework and demonstration video are publicly available at https://github.com/wzf2000/MACRec.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Text-to-image</b> retrieval plays a crucial role across various applications, including digital libraries, e-commerce platforms, and multimedia databases, by enabling the search for images using text queries. Despite the advancements in <b>Multimodal</b> <b>Large</b> <b>Language</b> <b>Models</b> (MLLMs), which offer leading-edge performance, their applicability in <b>large-scale,</b> <b>varied,</b> <b>and</b> ambiguous retrieval scenarios is constrained by significant computational demands and the generation of injective embeddings. This paper introduces the Text2Pic Swift framework, tailored for efficient and robust retrieval of images corresponding to extensive textual descriptions in sizable datasets. The framework employs a two-tier approach: the initial Entity-based Ranking (ER) stage addresses the ambiguity inherent in lengthy text queries through a multiple-queries-to-multiple-targets strategy, effectively narrowing down potential candidates for subsequent analysis. Following this, the Summary-based Re-ranking (SR) stage further refines these selections based on concise query summaries. Additionally, we present a novel Decoupling-BEiT-3 encoder, specifically designed to tackle the challenges of ambiguous queries and to facilitate both stages of the retrieval process, thereby significantly improving computational efficiency via vector-based similarity assessments. Our evaluation, conducted on the AToMiC dataset, demonstrates that Text2Pic Swift outperforms current MLLMs by achieving up to an 11.06% increase in Recall@1000, alongside reductions in training and retrieval durations by 68.75% and 99.79%, respectively.

**ABSTRACT**  
Temporal <b>question</b> <b>answering</b> <b>(QA)</b> involves time constraints, with phrases such as "... in 2019" or "... before COVID". In the former, time is an explicit condition, in the latter it is implicit. State-of-the-art methods have limitations along three dimensions. First, with neural inference, time constraints are merely soft-matched, giving room to invalid or inexplicable answers. Second, <b>questions</b> <b>with</b> implicit time are poorly supported. Third, answers come from a single source: either a knowledge base (KB) or a text corpus. We propose a temporal <b>QA</b> system that addresses these shortcomings. First, it enforces temporal constraints for faithful answering with tangible evidence. Second, it properly handles implicit <b>questions.</b> <b>Third,</b> it operates over heterogeneous sources, covering KB, text and web tables in a unified manner. The method has three stages: (i) understanding the <b>question</b> <b>and</b> its temporal conditions, (ii) retrieving evidence from all sources, and (iii) faithfully answering the <b>question.</b> <b>As</b> implicit <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> sparse in prior <b>benchmarks,</b> we introduce a principled method for generating diverse <b>questions.</b> <b>Experiments</b> show superior performance over a suite of baselines.

**ABSTRACT**  
Staying in the intensive care unit (ICU) is often traumatic, leading to post-intensive care syndrome (PICS), which encompasses physical, psychological, and cognitive impairments. Currently, there are limited interventions available for PICS. Studies indicate that exposure to visual art may help address the psychological aspects of PICS and be more effective if it is personalized. We develop Machine Learning-based Visual Art <b>Recommendation</b> Systems (VA RecSys) to enable personalized therapeutic visual art experiences for post-ICU patients. We investigate four state-of-the-art VA RecSys engines, evaluating the relevance of their <b>recommendations</b> for therapeutic purposes compared to expert-curated <b>recommendations.</b> We conduct an expert pilot test and a large-scale user study (n=150) to assess the appropriateness and effectiveness of these <b>recommendations.</b> Our results suggest all <b>recommendations</b> enhance temporal affective states. Visual and <b>multimodal</b> VA RecSys engines compare favourably with expert-curated <b>recommendations,</b> indicating their potential to support the delivery of personalized art therapy for PICS prevention and treatment.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Retrieval-augmented</b> <b>generation</b> <b>(RAG)</b> is a powerful technique to facilitate language model with proprietary and private data, where data privacy is a pivotal concern. Whereas extensive research has demonstrated the privacy risks of <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> <b>(LLMs),</b> the <b>RAG</b> technique could potentially reshape the inherent behaviors of <b>LLM</b> generation, posing new privacy issues that are currently under-explored. In this work, we conduct extensive empirical studies with novel attack methods, which demonstrate the vulnerability of <b>RAG</b> systems on leaking the private <b>retrieval</b> <b>database.</b> <b>Despite</b> the new risk brought by <b>RAG</b> on the <b>retrieval</b> <b>data,</b> <b>we</b> further reveal that <b>RAG</b> can mitigate the leakage of the <b>LLMs'</b> training data. Overall, we provide new insights in this paper for privacy protection of <b>retrieval-augmented</b> <b>LLMs,</b> <b>which</b> benefit both <b>LLMs</b> and <b>RAG</b> systems builders. Our code is available at https://github.com/phycholosogy/RAG-privacy.

**ABSTRACT**  
With the advancement of <b>Large</b> <b>Language</b> <b>Models</b> <b>(LLMs),</b> increasingly sophisticated and powerful <b>GPTs</b> are entering the market. Despite their popularity, the <b>LLM</b> ecosystem still remains unexplored. Additionally, <b>LLMs'</b> susceptibility to attacks raises concerns over safety and plagiarism. Thus, in this work, we conduct a pioneering exploration of <b>GPT</b> stores, aiming to study vulnerabilities and plagiarism within <b>GPT</b> applications. To begin with, we conduct, to our knowledge, the first <b>large-scale</b> <b>monitoring</b> <b>and</b> analysis of two stores, an unofficial GPTStore.AI, and an official OpenAI <b>GPT</b> Store. Then, we propose a TriLevel <b>GPT</b> Reversing (T-GR) strategy for extracting <b>GPT</b> internals. To complete these two tasks efficiently, we develop two automated tools: one for web scraping and another designed for programmatically interacting with <b>GPTs.</b> Our findings reveal a significant enthusiasm among users and developers for <b>GPT</b> interaction and creation, as evidenced by the rapid increase in <b>GPTs</b> and their creators. However, we also uncover a widespread failure to protect <b>GPT</b> internals, with nearly 90% of system <b>prompts</b> easily accessible, leading to considerable plagiarism and duplication among <b>GPTs.</b>

**ABSTRACT**  
Trojan signatures, as described by Fields et al. (2021), are noticeable differences in the distribution of the trojaned class parameters (weights) and the non-trojaned class parameters of the trojaned model, that can be used to detect the trojaned model. Fields et al. (2021) found trojan signatures in computer vision classification tasks with image models, such as, Resnet, WideResnet, Densenet, and VGG. In this paper, we investigate such signatures in the classifier layer parameters of <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> of source code. Our results suggest that trojan signatures could not generalize to <b>LLMs</b> of code. We found that trojaned code models are stubborn, even when the models were poisoned under more explicit settings <b>(finetuned</b> with pre-trained weights frozen). We analyzed nine trojaned models for two binary classification tasks: clone and defect detection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to examine weight-based trojan signature revelation techniques for <b>large-language</b> <b>models</b> <b>of</b> code and furthermore to demonstrate that detecting trojans only from the weights in such models is a hard problem.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this paper, we introduce a novel class of fast, beam search-based <b>adversarial</b> <b>attack</b> (BEAST) for Language Models (LMs). BEAST employs interpretable parameters, enabling attackers to balance between attack speed, success rate, and the readability of <b>adversarial</b> <b>prompts.</b> The computational efficiency of BEAST facilitates us to investigate its applications on LMs for jailbreaking, eliciting hallucinations, and privacy attacks. Our gradient-free targeted attack can jailbreak aligned LMs with high attack success rates within one minute. For instance, BEAST can jailbreak Vicuna-7B-v1.5 under one minute with a success rate of 89% when compared to a gradient-based baseline that takes over an hour to achieve 70% success rate using a single Nvidia RTX A6000 48GB GPU. Additionally, we discover a unique outcome wherein our untargeted attack induces hallucinations in LM <b>chatbots.</b> Through human evaluations, we find that our untargeted attack causes Vicuna-7B-v1.5 to produce ~15% more incorrect outputs when compared to LM outputs in the absence of our attack. We also learn that 22% of the time, BEAST causes Vicuna to generate outputs that are not relevant to the original <b>prompt.</b> Further, we use BEAST to generate <b>adversarial</b> <b>prompts</b> in a few seconds that can boost the performance of existing membership inference attacks for LMs. We believe that our fast attack, BEAST, has the potential to accelerate research in LM security and privacy. Our codebase is publicly available at https://github.com/vinusankars/BEAST.

**ABSTRACT**  
Extremely large image generators offer significant transformative potential across diverse sectors. It allows users to design specific <b>prompts</b> to generate realistic images through some <b>black-box</b> <b>APIs.</b> However, some studies reveal that image generators are notably susceptible to attacks and generate Not Suitable For Work (NSFW) contents by manually designed toxin texts, especially imperceptible to human observers. We urgently need a multitude of universal and transferable <b>prompts</b> to improve the safety of image generators, especially <b>black-box-released</b> <b>APIs.</b> Nevertheless, they are constrained by labor-intensive design processes and heavily reliant on the quality of the given instructions. To achieve this, we introduce a <b>black-box</b> <b>stealthy</b> <b>prompt</b> attack (BSPA) that adopts a retriever to simulate attacks from API users. It can effectively harness filter scores to tune the retrieval space of sensitive words for matching the input <b>prompts,</b> thereby crafting stealthy <b>prompts</b> tailored for image generators. Significantly, this approach is model-agnostic and requires no internal access to the model's features, ensuring its applicability to a wide range of image generators. Building on BSPA, we have constructed an automated <b>prompt</b> tool and a comprehensive <b>prompt</b> attack dataset (NSFWeval). Extensive experiments demonstrate that BSPA effectively explores the security vulnerabilities in a variety of state-of-the-art available <b>black-box</b> <b>models,</b> including Stable Diffusion XL, Midjourney, and DALL-E 2/3. Furthermore, we develop a resilient text filter and offer targeted <b>recommendations</b> to ensure the security of image generators against <b>prompt</b> attacks in the future.

**ABSTRACT**  
APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) with the characteristics of persistence, stealth, and diversity is one of the greatest threats against cyber-infrastructure. As a countermeasure, existing studies leverage provenance <b>graphs</b> to capture the complex relations between system entities in a host for effective APT detection. In addition to detecting single attack events as most existing work does, understanding the tactics / techniques (e.g., Kill-Chain, ATT&CK) applied to organize and accomplish the APT attack campaign is more important for security operations. Existing studies try to manually design a set of rules to map low-level system events to high-level APT tactics / techniques. However, the rule based methods are coarse-grained and lack generalization ability, thus they can only recognize APT tactics and cannot identify fine-grained APT techniques and mutant APT attacks. In this paper, we propose TREC, the first attempt to recognize APT tactics / techniques from provenance <b>graphs</b> by exploiting deep learning techniques. To address the "needle in a haystack" problem, TREC segments small and compact subgraphs covering individual APT technique instances from a large provenance <b>graph</b> based on a malicious node detection model and a subgraph sampling algorithm. To address the "training sample scarcity" problem, TREC trains the APT tactic / technique recognition model in a <b>few-shot</b> <b>learning</b> manner by adopting a Siamese neural network. We evaluate TREC based on a customized dataset collected and made public by our team. The experiment results show that TREC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art systems in APT tactic recognition and TREC can also effectively identify APT techniques.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Reinforcement</b> <b>Learning</b> (RL), one of the core paradigms in machine learning, learns to make decisions based on real-world experiences. This approach has significantly advanced AI applications across various domains, notably in smart grid optimization and smart home automation. However, the proliferation of RL in these critical sectors has also exposed them to sophisticated <b>adversarial</b> <b>attacks</b> that target the underlying neural network policies, compromising system integrity. Given the pivotal role of RL in enhancing the efficiency and sustainability of smart grids and the personalized convenience in smart homes, ensuring the security of these systems is paramount. This paper aims to bolster the resilience of RL frameworks within these specific contexts, addressing the unique challenges posed by the intricate and potentially <b>adversarial</b> <b>environments</b> of smart grids and smart homes. We provide a thorough review of the latest <b>adversarial</b> <b>RL</b> threats and outline effective defense strategies tailored to safeguard these applications. Our comparative analysis sheds light on the nuances of <b>adversarial</b> <b>tactics</b> against RL-driven smart systems and evaluates the defense mechanisms, focusing on their innovative contributions, limitations, and the compromises they entail. By concentrating on the smart grid and smart home scenarios, this survey equips ML developers and researchers with the insights needed to secure RL applications against emerging threats, ensuring their reliability and safety in our increasingly connected world.

**ABSTRACT**  
Emergency communication is critical but challenging after natural disasters when ground infrastructure is devastated. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offer enormous potential for agile relief coordination in these scenarios. However, effectively leveraging UAV fleets poses additional challenges around security, privacy, and efficient collaboration across response agencies. This paper presents a robust blockchain-enabled framework to address these challenges by integrating a consortium blockchain model, smart contracts, and cryptographic techniques to securely coordinate UAV fleets for disaster response. Specifically, we make two key contributions: a consortium blockchain architecture for secure and private multi-agency coordination; and an optimized consensus protocol balancing efficiency and fault tolerance using a delegated proof of stake practical byzantine fault tolerance (DPoS-PBFT). Comprehensive <b>simulations</b> showcase the framework's ability to enhance transparency, automation, scalability, and cyber-attack resilience for UAV coordination in post-disaster networks.

**ABSTRACT**  
Passwords remain a widely-used authentication mechanism, despite their well-known security and usability limitations. To improve on this situation, next-generation authentication mechanisms, based on behavioral biometric factors such as eye movement and brainwave have emerged. However, their usability remains relatively under-explored. To fill this gap, we conducted an empirical user study (n=32 participants) to evaluate three brain-based and three eye-based authentication mechanisms, using both qualitative and quantitative methods. Our findings show good overall usability according to the System Usability Scale for both categories of mechanisms, with average SUS scores in the range of 78.6-79.6 and the best mechanisms rated with an "excellent" score. Participants particularly identified brainwave authentication as more secure yet more privacy-invasive and effort-intensive compared to eye movement authentication. However, the significant number of neutral responses indicates participants' need for more detailed information about the security and privacy implications of these authentication methods. Building on the collected evidence, we identify three key areas for improvement: privacy, authentication interface design, and verification time. We offer <b>recommendations</b> for designers and developers to improve the usability and security of next-generation authentication mechanisms.

**ABSTRACT**  
Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) have evolved from being a theoretical concept providing privacy and verifiability to having practical, real-world implementations, with SNARKs (Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge) emerging as one of the most significant innovations. Prior work has mainly focused on designing more efficient SNARK systems and providing security proofs for them. Many think of SNARKs as "just math," implying that what is proven to be correct and secure is correct in practice. In contrast, this paper focuses on assessing end-to-end security properties of real-life SNARK implementations. We start by building foundations with a system model and by establishing threat models and defining adversarial roles for systems that use SNARKs. Our study encompasses an extensive analysis of 141 actual vulnerabilities in SNARK implementations, providing a detailed taxonomy to aid developers and security researchers in understanding the security threats in systems employing SNARKs. Finally, we evaluate existing defense mechanisms and offer <b>recommendations</b> for enhancing the security of SNARK-based systems, paving the way for more robust and reliable implementations in the future.

**ABSTRACT**  
Deep learning-based malware detectors have been shown to be susceptible to <b>adversarial</b> <b>malware</b> examples, i.e. malware examples that have been deliberately manipulated in order to avoid detection. In light of the vulnerability of deep learning detectors to subtle input file modifications, we propose a practical defense against <b>adversarial</b> <b>malware</b> examples inspired by (de)randomized smoothing. In this work, we reduce the chances of sampling <b>adversarial</b> <b>content</b> injected by malware authors by selecting correlated subsets of bytes, rather than using Gaussian noise to randomize inputs like in the Computer Vision (CV) domain. During training, our ablation-based smoothing scheme trains a base classifier to make classifications on a subset of contiguous bytes or chunk of bytes. At test time, a large number of chunks are then classified by a base classifier and the consensus among these classifications is then reported as the final prediction. We propose two strategies to determine the location of the chunks used for classification: (1) randomly selecting the locations of the chunks and (2) selecting contiguous adjacent chunks. To showcase the effectiveness of our approach, we have trained two classifiers with our chunk-based ablation schemes on the BODMAS dataset. Our findings reveal that the chunk-based smoothing classifiers exhibit greater resilience against <b>adversarial</b> <b>malware</b> examples generated with state-of-the-are evasion attacks, outperforming a non-smoothed classifier and a randomized smoothing-based classifier by a great margin.

**ABSTRACT**  
Secure aggregation enables <b>federated</b> <b>learning</b> (FL) to perform collaborative training of clients from local gradient updates without exposing raw data. However, existing secure aggregation schemes inevitably perform an expensive fresh setup per round because each client needs to establish fresh input-independent secrets over different rounds. The latest research, Flamingo (S&P 2023), designed a share-transfer-based reusable secret key to support the server continuously performing multiple rounds of aggregation. Nevertheless, the share transfer mechanism it proposed can only be achieved with P probability, which has limited reliability. To tackle the aforementioned problems, we propose a more reliable and anonymously authenticated scheme called Chu-ko-nu for multi-round secure aggregation. Specifically, in terms of share transfer, Chu-ko-nu breaks the probability P barrier by supplementing a redistribution process of secret key components (the sum of all components is the secret key), thus ensuring the reusability of the secret key. Based on this reusable secret key, Chu-ko-nu can efficiently perform consecutive aggregation in the following rounds. Furthermore, considering the client identity authentication and privacy protection issue most approaches ignore, Chu-ko-nu introduces a zero-knowledge proof-based authentication mechanism. It can support clients anonymously participating in FL training and enables the server to authenticate clients effectively in the presence of various attacks. Rigorous security proofs and extensive experiments demonstrated that Chu-ko-nu can provide reliable and anonymously authenticated aggregation for FL with low aggregation costs, at least a 21.02% reduction compared to the state-of-the-art schemes.

**ABSTRACT**  
Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) studies generate thousands of hours of audio, which may be used to monitor specific animal populations, conduct broad biodiversity surveys, detect threats such as poachers, and more. Machine learning classifiers for species identification are increasingly being used to process the vast amount of audio generated by bioacoustic surveys, expediting analysis and increasing the utility of PAM as a management tool. In common practice, a threshold is applied to classifier output scores, and scores above the threshold are aggregated into a detection count. The choice of threshold produces biased counts of vocalizations, which are subject to false positive/negative rates that may vary across subsets of the dataset. In this work, we advocate for directly estimating call density: The proportion of detection windows containing the target vocalization, regardless of classifier score. Our approach targets a desirable ecological estimator and provides a more rigorous <b>grounding</b> for identifying the core problems caused by <b>distribution</b> <b>shifts</b> -- when the defining characteristics of the data <b>distribution</b> <b>change</b> -- and designing strategies to mitigate them. We propose a validation scheme for estimating call density in a body of data and obtain, through Bayesian <b>reasoning,</b> probability <b>distributions</b> <b>of</b> confidence scores for both the positive and negative classes. We use these <b>distributions</b> <b>to</b> predict site-level densities, which may be subject to <b>distribution</b> <b>shifts.</b> We test our proposed methods on a real-world study of Hawaiian birds and provide <b>simulation</b> results leveraging existing fully annotated datasets, demonstrating robustness to variations in call density and classifier model quality.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Semi-supervised</b> <b>learning</b> has received increasingly attention in statistics and machine learning. In <b>semi-supervised</b> <b>learning</b> settings, a labeled data set with both outcomes and covariates and an unlabeled data set with covariates only are collected. We consider an inference problem in <b>semi-supervised</b> <b>settings</b> where the outcome in the labeled data is binary and the labeled data is collected by case-control sampling. Case-control sampling is an effective sampling scheme for alleviating imbalance structure in binary data. Under the <b>logistic</b> <b>model</b> assumption, case-control data can still provide consistent estimator for the slope parameter of the regression model. However, the intercept parameter is not identifiable. Consequently, the marginal case proportion cannot be estimated from case-control data. We find out that with the availability of the unlabeled data, the intercept parameter can be identified in <b>semi-supervised</b> <b>learning</b> setting. We construct the likelihood function of the observed labeled and unlabeled data and obtain the maximum likelihood estimator via an iterative algorithm. The proposed estimator is shown to be consistent, asymptotically normal, and semiparametrically efficient. Extensive <b>simulation</b> studies are conducted to show the finite sample performance of the proposed method. The results imply that the unlabeled data not only helps to identify the intercept but also improves the estimation efficiency of the slope parameter. Meanwhile, the marginal case proportion can be estimated accurately by the proposed method.

**ABSTRACT**  
The performance of <b>stochastic</b> <b>gradient</b> <b>descent</b> <b>(SGD),</b> which is the simplest first-order optimizer for training deep neural networks, depends on not only the learning rate but also the batch size. They both affect the number of iterations and the <b>stochastic</b> <b>first-order</b> <b>oracle</b> (SFO) complexity needed for training. In particular, the previous numerical results indicated that, for <b>SGD</b> using a constant learning rate, the number of iterations needed for training decreases when the batch size increases, and the SFO complexity needed for training is minimized at a critical batch size and that it increases once the batch size exceeds that size. Here, we study the relationship between batch size and the iteration and SFO complexities needed for nonconvex optimization in deep learning with <b>SGD</b> using constant or decaying learning rates and show that <b>SGD</b> using the critical batch size minimizes the SFO complexity. We also provide numerical comparisons of <b>SGD</b> with the existing first-order optimizers and show the usefulness of <b>SGD</b> using a critical batch size. Moreover, we show that measured critical batch sizes are close to the sizes estimated from our theoretical results.

**ABSTRACT**  
Regression analysis is a central topic in statistical modeling, aiming to estimate the relationships between a dependent variable, commonly referred to as the response variable, and one or more independent variables, i.e., explanatory variables. Linear regression is by far the most popular method for performing this task in several fields of research, such as prediction, forecasting, or causal inference. Beyond various classical methods to solve linear regression problems, such as Ordinary Least Squares, Ridge, or Lasso regressions - which are often the foundation for more advanced machine learning (ML) techniques - the latter have been successfully applied in this scenario without a formal definition of statistical significance. At most, permutation or classical analyses based on empirical measures (e.g., residuals or accuracy) have been conducted to reflect the greater ability of ML estimations for detection. In this paper, we introduce a method, named Statistical Agnostic Regression (SAR), for evaluating the statistical significance of an ML-based linear regression based on concentration inequalities of the actual risk using the analysis of the worst case. To achieve this goal, similar to the classification problem, we define a threshold to establish that there is sufficient evidence with a probability of at least 1-eta to conclude that there is a linear relationship in the population between the explanatory (feature) and the response (label) variables. <b>Simulations</b> in only two dimensions demonstrate the ability of the proposed agnostic test to provide a similar analysis of variance given by the classical $F$ test for the slope parameter.

**ABSTRACT**  
Sampling from probability densities is a common challenge in fields such as Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) and Generative Modelling (GM). In GM in particular, the use of reverse-time diffusion processes depending on the log-densities of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck forward processes are a popular sampling tool. In Berner et al. [2022] the authors point out that these log-densities can be obtained by solution of a \textit{Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman} (HJB) equation known from stochastic optimal control. While this HJB equation is usually treated with indirect methods such as policy iteration and <b>unsupervised</b> training of <b>black-box</b> <b>architectures</b> like Neural Networks, we propose instead to solve the HJB equation by direct time integration, using compressed polynomials represented in the Tensor Train (TT) format for spatial discretization. Crucially, this method is sample-free, agnostic to normalization constants and can avoid the curse of dimensionality due to the TT compression. We provide a complete derivation of the HJB equation's action on Tensor Train polynomials and demonstrate the performance of the proposed time-step-, rank- and degree-adaptive integration method on a nonlinear sampling task in 20 dimensions.

**ABSTRACT**  
We study the problem of selecting $k$ experiments from a larger candidate pool, where the goal is to maximize <b>mutual</b> <b>information</b> (MI) between the selected subset and the underlying parameters. Finding the exact solution is to this combinatorial optimization problem is computationally costly, not only due to the complexity of the combinatorial search but also the difficulty of evaluating MI in nonlinear/non-Gaussian settings. We propose greedy approaches based on new computationally inexpensive lower bounds for MI, constructed via log-Sobolev inequalities. We demonstrate that our method outperforms random selection strategies, Gaussian approximations, and nested Monte Carlo (NMC) estimators of MI in various settings, including optimal design for nonlinear models with non-additive noise.

**ABSTRACT**  
Causal learning is a fundamental problem in statistics and science, offering insights into predicting the effects of unseen treatments on a system. Despite recent advances in this topic, most existing causal discovery algorithms operate under two key assumptions: (i) the underlying <b>graph</b> is acyclic, and (ii) the available data is complete. These assumptions can be problematic as many real-world systems contain feedback loops (e.g., biological systems), and practical scenarios frequently involve missing data. In this work, we propose a novel framework, named MissNODAGS, for learning cyclic causal <b>graphs</b> from partially missing data. Under the additive noise model, MissNODAGS learns the causal <b>graph</b> by alternating between imputing the missing data and maximizing the expected log-likelihood of the visible part of the data in each training step, following the principles of the expectation-maximization (EM) framework. Through synthetic experiments and real-world single-cell perturbation data, we demonstrate improved performance when compared to using state-of-the-art imputation techniques followed by causal learning on partially missing interventional data.

**ABSTRACT**  
In recent years, machine learning, and in particular generative adversarial neural networks <b>(GANs)</b> and attention-based neural networks <b>(transformers),</b> have been successfully used to compose and generate music, both melodies and polyphonic pieces. Current research focuses foremost on <b>style</b> <b>replication</b> (eg. generating a Bach-style chorale) or <b>style</b> <b>transfer</b> (eg. classical to jazz) based on large amounts of recorded or transcribed music, which in turn also allows for fairly straight-forward "performance" evaluation. However, most of these models are not suitable for human-machine co-creation through live interaction, neither is clear, how such models and resulting creations would be evaluated. This article presents a thorough review of music representation, feature analysis, heuristic algorithms, statistical and parametric modelling, and human and <b>automatic</b> <b>evaluation</b> measures, along with a discussion of which approaches and models seem most suitable for live interaction.

**ABSTRACT**  
Most efforts in Computer Vision focus on natural images or artwork, which differ significantly both in size and contents from the kind of data biomedical image processing deals with. Thus, <b>Transfer</b> <b>Learning</b> models often prove themselves suboptimal for these tasks, even after manual <b>finetuning.</b> The development of architectures from scratch is oftentimes unfeasible due to the vastness of the hyperparameter space and a shortage of time, computational resources and Deep Learning experts in most biomedical research laboratories. An alternative to manually defining the models is the use of Neuroevolution, which employs metaheuristic techniques to optimize Deep Learning architectures. However, many algorithms proposed in the neuroevolutive literature are either too unreliable or limited to a small, predefined region of the hyperparameter space. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose the Chimera Algorithm, a novel, hybrid neuroevolutive algorithm that integrates the Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm with Evolutionary Computation tools to generate models from scratch, as well as to refine a given previous architecture to better fit the task at hand. The Chimera Algorithm has been validated with two datasets of natural and medical images, producing models that surpassed the performance of those coming from <b>Transfer</b> <b>Learning.</b>

**ABSTRACT**  
Current hyperspectral <b>anomaly</b> <b>detection</b> (HAD) <b>benchmark</b> datasets suffer from low resolution, simple background, and small size of the detection data. These factors also limit the performance of the well-known low-rank representation (LRR) models in terms of robustness on the separation of background and target features and the reliance on manual parameter selection. To this end, we build a new set of HAD <b>benchmark</b> datasets for improving the robustness of the HAD algorithm in complex scenarios, AIR-HAD for short. Accordingly, we propose a generalized and interpretable HAD network by deeply unfolding a dictionary-learnable LLR model, named LRR-Net$^+$, which is capable of spectrally decoupling the background structure and object properties in a more generalized fashion and eliminating the bias introduced by vital interference targets concurrently. In addition, LRR-Net$^+$ integrates the solution process of the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) optimizer with the deep network, guiding its search process and imparting a level of interpretability to parameter optimization. Additionally, the integration of physical models with DL techniques eliminates the need for manual parameter tuning. The manually tuned parameters are seamlessly transformed into trainable parameters for deep neural networks, facilitating a more efficient and automated optimization process. Extensive experiments conducted on the AIR-HAD dataset show the superiority of our LRR-Net$^+$ in terms of detection performance and generalization ability, compared to top-performing rivals. Furthermore, the compilable codes and our AIR-HAD <b>benchmark</b> datasets in this paper will be made available freely and openly at \url{https://sites.google.com/view/danfeng-hong}.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recently, there has been great progress in the ability of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to classify dermatological conditions from clinical photographs. However, little is known about the robustness of these algorithms in real-world settings where several factors can lead to a loss of generalizability. Understanding and overcoming these limitations will permit the development of generalizable AI that can aid in the diagnosis of skin conditions across a variety of clinical settings. In this retrospective study, we demonstrate that differences in skin condition distribution, rather than in demographics or image capture mode are the main source of errors when an AI algorithm is evaluated on data from a previously unseen source. We demonstrate a series of steps to close this generalization gap, requiring progressively more information about the new source, ranging from the condition distribution to training data enriched for data less frequently seen during training. Our results also suggest comparable performance from end-to-end fine tuning versus fine tuning solely the classification layer on top of a frozen embedding model. Our approach can inform the adaptation of AI algorithms to new settings, based on the information and resources available.

**ABSTRACT**  
The booming success of <b>LLMs</b> initiates rapid development in <b>LLM</b> agents. Though the foundation of an <b>LLM</b> agent is the generative model, it is critical to devise the optimal <b>reasoning</b> strategies and agent architectures. Accordingly, <b>LLM</b> agent research advances from the simple <b>chain-of-thought</b> <b>prompting</b> to more complex ReAct and Reflection <b>reasoning</b> strategy; agent architecture also evolves from single agent generation to multi-agent conversation, as well as multi-LLM multi-agent group chat. However, with the existing intricate frameworks and libraries, creating and evaluating new <b>reasoning</b> strategies and agent architectures has become a complex challenge, which hinders research investigation into <b>LLM</b> agents. Thus, we open-source a new AI agent library, AgentLite, which simplifies this process by offering a lightweight, user-friendly platform for innovating <b>LLM</b> agent <b>reasoning,</b> architectures, and applications with ease. AgentLite is a task-oriented framework designed to enhance the ability of agents to break down tasks and facilitate the development of multi-agent systems. Furthermore, we introduce multiple practical applications developed with AgentLite to demonstrate its convenience and flexibility.

**ABSTRACT**  
Multi-agent <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning</b> is an area of rapid advancement in artificial intelligence and machine learning. One of the important questions to be answered is how to conduct credit assignment in a multi-agent system. There have been many schemes designed to conduct credit assignment by multi-agent <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning</b> algorithms. Although these credit assignment schemes have been proved useful in improving the performance of multi-agent <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning,</b> most of them are designed heuristically without a rigorous theoretic basis and therefore infeasible to understand how agents cooperate. In this thesis, we aim at investigating the foundation of credit assignment in multi-agent <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning</b> via cooperative game theory. We first extend a game model called convex game and a payoff distribution scheme called Shapley value in cooperative game theory to <b>Markov</b> <b>decision</b> <b>process,</b> named as <b>Markov</b> <b>convex</b> <b>game</b> and <b>Markov</b> <b>Shapley</b> <b>value</b> respectively. We represent a global reward game as a <b>Markov</b> <b>convex</b> <b>game</b> under the grand coalition. As a result, <b>Markov</b> <b>Shapley</b> <b>value</b> can be reasonably used as a credit assignment scheme in the global reward game. <b>Markov</b> <b>Shapley</b> <b>value</b> possesses the following virtues: (i) efficiency; (ii) identifiability of dummy agents; (iii) reflecting the contribution and (iv) symmetry, which form the fair credit assignment. Based on <b>Markov</b> <b>Shapley</b> <b>value,</b> we propose three multi-agent <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning</b> algorithms called SHAQ, SQDDPG and SMFPPO. Furthermore, we extend <b>Markov</b> <b>convex</b> <b>game</b> to partial observability to deal with the partially observable problems, named as partially observable <b>Markov</b> <b>convex</b> <b>game.</b> In application, we evaluate SQDDPG and SMFPPO on the real-world problem in energy networks.

**ABSTRACT**  
Ad hoc teamwork poses a challenging problem, requiring the design of an agent to collaborate with teammates without prior coordination or joint training. Open ad hoc teamwork further complicates this challenge by considering environments with a changing number of teammates, referred to as open teams. The state-of-the-art solution to this problem is <b>graph-based</b> <b>policy</b> <b>learning</b> (GPL), leveraging the generalizability of <b>graph</b> <b>neural</b> <b>networks</b> to handle an unrestricted number of agents and effectively address open teams. GPL's performance is superior to other methods, but its joint Q-value representation presents challenges for interpretation, hindering further development of this research line and applicability. In this paper, we establish a new theory to give an interpretation for the joint Q-value representation employed in GPL, from the perspective of cooperative game theory. Building on our theory, we propose a novel algorithm based on GPL framework, to complement the critical features that facilitate learning, but overlooked in GPL. Through experiments, we demonstrate the correctness of our theory by comparing the performance of the resulting algorithm with GPL in dynamic team compositions.

**ABSTRACT**  
Large-scale multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) presents significant challenges in several areas. As systems grow in complexity with a multitude of autonomous agents operating simultaneously, efficient and collision-free coordination becomes paramount. Traditional algorithms often fall short in scalability, especially in intricate scenarios. <b>Reinforcement</b> <b>Learning</b> (RL) has shown potential to address the intricacies of MAPF; however, it has also been shown to struggle with scalability, demanding intricate implementation, lengthy training, and often exhibiting unstable convergence, limiting its practical application. In this paper, we introduce Heuristics-Informed Multi-Agent Pathfinding (HiMAP), a novel scalable approach that employs imitation learning with heuristic guidance in a decentralized manner. We train on small-scale instances using a heuristic policy as a teacher that maps each single agent observation information to an action probability distribution. During pathfinding, we adopt several inference techniques to improve performance. With a simple training scheme and implementation, HiMAP demonstrates competitive results in terms of success rate and scalability in the field of imitation-learning-only MAPF, showing the potential of imitation-learning-only MAPF equipped with inference techniques.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Large</b> <b>Language</b> <b>models</b> <b>(LLMs)</b> are finding wide use in software engineering practice. These models are extremely data-hungry, and are largely trained on open-source (OSS) code distributed with permissive licenses. In terms of actual use however, a great deal of software development still occurs in the for-profit/proprietary sphere, where the code under development is not, and never has been, in the public domain; thus, many developers, do their work, and use <b>LLMs,</b> in settings where the models may not be as familiar with the code under development. In such settings, do <b>LLMs</b> work as well as they do for OSS code? If not, what are the differences? When performance differs, what are the possible causes, and are there work-arounds? In this paper, we examine this issue using proprietary, closed-source software data from Microsoft, where most proprietary code is in C# and C++. We find that performance for C# changes little from OSS --> proprietary code, but does significantly reduce for C++; we find that this difference is attributable to differences in identifiers. We also find that some performance degradation, in some cases, can be ameliorated efficiently by <b>in-context</b> <b>learning.</b>

**ABSTRACT**  
XML configurations are integral to the Android development framework, particularly in the realm of UI display. However, these configurations can introduce compatibility issues (bugs), resulting in divergent visual outcomes and system crashes across various Android API versions (levels). In this study, we systematically investigate <b>LLM-based</b> approaches for detecting and repairing configuration compatibility bugs. Our findings highlight certain limitations of <b>LLMs</b> in effectively identifying and resolving these bugs, while also revealing their potential in addressing complex, hard-to-repair issues that traditional tools struggle with. Leveraging these insights, we introduce the <b>LLM-CompDroid</b> framework, which combines the strengths of <b>LLMs</b> and traditional tools for bug resolution. Our experimental results demonstrate a significant enhancement in bug resolution performance by <b>LLM-CompDroid,</b> with <b>LLM-CompDroid-GPT-3.5</b> and <b>LLM-CompDroid-GPT-4</b> surpassing the state-of-the-art tool, ConfFix, by at least 9.8% and 10.4% in both Correct and Correct@k metrics, respectively. This innovative approach holds promise for advancing the reliability and robustness of Android applications, making a valuable contribution to the field of software development.

**ABSTRACT**  
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) has enabled cloud customers to have more agility in creating and modifying complex deployments of cloud-provisioned resources. By writing a configuration in IaC languages such as CloudFormation, users can declaratively specify their infrastructure and CloudFormation will handle the creation of the resources. However, understanding the complexity of IaC deployments has emerged as an unsolved issue. In particular, estimating the cost of an IaC deployment requires estimating the future usage and pricing models of every cloud resource in the deployment. Gaining transparency into predicted usage/costs is a leading challenge in cloud management. Existing work either relies on historical usage metrics to predict cost or on coarse-grain static analysis that ignores interactions between resources. Our key insight is that the topology of an IaC deployment imposes constraints on the usage of each resource, and we can formalize and automate the <b>reasoning</b> on constraints by using an SMT solver. This allows customers to have formal guarantees on the bounds of their cloud usage. We propose a tool for fine-grained static usage analysis that works by modeling the inter-resource interactions in an IaC deployment as a set of SMT constraints, and evaluate our tool on a <b>benchmark</b> of over 1000 real world IaC configurations.

**ABSTRACT**  
Configuring and evolving dashboards in complex and large-scale Systems-of-Systems (SoS) can be an expensive and cumbersome task due to the many Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that are usually collected and have to be arranged in a number of visualizations. Unfortunately, setting up dashboards is still a largely manual and error-prone task requiring extensive <b>human</b> <b>intervention.</b> This short paper describes emerging results about the definition of a model-driven technology-agnostic approach that can automatically transform a simple list of KPIs into a dashboard model, and then translate the model into an actual dashboard for a target dashboard technology. Dashboard customization can be efficiently obtained by solely modifying the abstract model representation, freeing operators from expensive interactions with actual dashboards.

**ABSTRACT**  
The advent of <b>generative</b> <b>AI</b> (GenAI) technology produces transformative impact on the content creation landscape, offering alternative approaches to produce diverse, high-quality content across media, thereby reshaping online ecosystems but also raising concerns about market over-saturation and the potential marginalization of human creativity. Our work introduces a competition model generalized from the Tullock contest to analyze the tension between human creators and GenAI. Our theory and <b>simulations</b> suggest that despite challenges, a stable equilibrium between human and AI-generated content is possible. Our work contributes to understanding the competitive dynamics in the content creation industry, offering insights into the future interplay between human creativity and technological advancements in GenAI.

**ABSTRACT**  
Collaboration is crucial for reaching collective goals. However, its effectiveness is often undermined by the strategic behavior of individual agents -- a fact that is captured by a high Price of Stability (PoS) in recent literature [Blum et al., 2021]. Implicit in the traditional PoS analysis is the assumption that agents have full knowledge of how their tasks relate to one another. We offer a new perspective on bringing about efficient collaboration among strategic agents using information design. Inspired by the growing importance of collaboration in machine learning (such as platforms for collaborative <b>federated</b> <b>learning</b> and data cooperatives), we propose a framework where the platform has more information about how the agents' tasks relate to each other than the agents themselves. We characterize how and to what degree such platforms can leverage their information advantage to steer strategic agents toward efficient collaboration. Concretely, we consider collaboration networks where each node is a task type held by one agent, and each task benefits from contributions made in their inclusive neighborhood of tasks. This network structure is known to the agents and the platform, but only the platform knows each agent's real location -- from the agents' perspective, their location is determined by a random permutation. We employ private Bayesian persuasion and design two families of persuasive signaling schemes that the platform can use to ensure a small total workload when agents follow the signal. The first family aims to achieve the minmax optimal approximation ratio compared to the optimal collaboration, which is shown to be $\Theta(\sqrt{n})$ for unit-weight <b>graphs,</b> $\Theta(n^{2/3})$ for <b>graphs</b> with constant minimum edge weights, and $O(n^{3/4})$ for general weighted <b>graphs.</b> The second family ensures per-instance strict improvement compared to full information disclosure.

**ABSTRACT**  
Decentralized Finance (DeFi) ecosystems, exemplified by the Maker Protocol, rely on intricate games to maintain stability and security. Understanding the dynamics of these games is crucial for ensuring the robustness of the system. This motivating research proposes a novel methodology leveraging Multi-Agent Influence Diagrams (MAID), originally proposed by Koller and Milch, to dissect and analyze the games within the Maker stablecoin protocol. By representing users and governance of the Maker protocol as agents and their interactions as edges in a <b>graph,</b> we capture the complex network of influences governing agent behaviors. Furthermore in the upcoming papers, we will show a Nash Equilibrium model to elucidate strategies that promote coordination and enhance economic security within the ecosystem. Through this approach, we aim to motivate the use of this method to introduce a new method of formal verification of game theoretic security in DeFi platforms.

**ABSTRACT**  
As a model-free algorithm, deep <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning</b> (DRL) agent learns and makes decisions by interacting with the environment in an <b>unsupervised</b> way. In recent years, DRL algorithms have been widely applied by scholars for portfolio optimization in consecutive trading periods, since the DRL agent can dynamically adapt to market changes and does not rely on the specification of the joint dynamics across the assets. However, typical DRL agents for portfolio optimization cannot learn a policy that is aware of the dynamic correlation between portfolio asset returns. Since the dynamic correlations among portfolio assets are crucial in optimizing the portfolio, the lack of such knowledge makes it difficult for the DRL agent to maximize the return per unit of risk, especially when the target market permits short selling (i.e., the US stock market). In this research, we propose a hybrid portfolio optimization model combining the DRL agent and the Black-Litterman (BL) model to enable the DRL agent to learn the dynamic correlation between the portfolio asset returns and implement an efficacious long/short strategy based on the correlation. Essentially, the DRL agent is trained to learn the policy to apply the BL model to determine the target portfolio weights. To test our DRL agent, we construct the portfolio based on all the Dow Jones Industrial Average constitute stocks. Empirical results of the experiments conducted on real-world United States stock market data demonstrate that our DRL agent significantly outperforms various comparison portfolio choice strategies and alternative DRL frameworks by at least 42% in terms of accumulated return. In terms of the return per unit of risk, our DRL agent significantly outperforms various comparative portfolio choice strategies and alternative strategies based on other machine learning frameworks.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Prompt-based</b> interfaces for <b>Large</b> <b>Language</b> <b>Models</b> <b>(LLMs)</b> have made prototyping and building AI-powered applications easier than ever before. However, identifying potential harms that may arise from AI applications remains a challenge, particularly during <b>prompt-based</b> prototyping. To address this, we present Farsight, a novel in situ interactive tool that helps people identify potential harms from the AI applications they are prototyping. Based on a user's <b>prompt,</b> Farsight highlights news articles about relevant AI incidents and allows users to explore and edit <b>LLM-generated</b> use cases, stakeholders, and harms. We report design insights from a co-design study with 10 AI prototypers and findings from a user study with 42 AI prototypers. After using Farsight, AI prototypers in our user study are better able to independently identify potential harms associated with a <b>prompt</b> and find our tool more useful and usable than existing resources. Their qualitative feedback also highlights that Farsight encourages them to focus on end-users and think beyond immediate harms. We discuss these findings and reflect on their implications for designing AI prototyping experiences that meaningfully engage with AI harms. Farsight is publicly accessible at: https://PAIR-code.github.io/farsight.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> <b>(LLMs)</b> have facilitated significant strides in generating conversational agents, enabling seamless, contextually relevant dialogues across diverse topics. However, the existing <b>LLM-driven</b> conversational agents have fixed personalities and functionalities, limiting their adaptability to individual user needs. Creating personalized agent personas with distinct expertise or traits can address this issue. Nonetheless, we lack knowledge of how people customize and interact with agent personas. In this research, we investigated how users customize agent personas and their impact on interaction quality, diversity, and dynamics. To this end, we developed CloChat, an interface supporting easy and accurate customization of agent personas in <b>LLMs.</b> We conducted a study comparing how participants interact with CloChat and <b>ChatGPT.</b> The results indicate that participants formed emotional bonds with the customized agents, engaged in more dynamic dialogues, and showed interest in sustaining interactions. These findings contribute to design implications for future systems with conversational agents using <b>LLMs.</b>

**ABSTRACT**  
Trust in digital systems depends on secure hardware, often assured through Hardware Reverse Engineering (HRE). This work develops methods for investigating human problem-solving processes in HRE, an underexplored yet critical aspect. Since reverse engineers rely heavily on visual information, eye tracking holds promise for studying their cognitive processes. To gain further insights, we additionally employ verbal thought protocols during and immediately after HRE tasks: Concurrent and Retrospective Think Aloud. We evaluate the combination of eye tracking and Think Aloud with 41 participants in an HRE <b>simulation.</b> Eye tracking accurately identifies fixations on individual circuit elements and highlights critical components. Based on two use cases, we demonstrate that eye tracking and Think Aloud can complement each other to improve data quality. Our methodological insights can inform future studies in HRE, a specific setting of human-computer interaction, and in other problem-solving settings involving misleading or missing information.

**ABSTRACT**  
Photo-realistic avatar is a modern term referring to the digital asset that represents a human in computer graphic advance systems such as video games and <b>simulation</b> tools. These avatars utilize the advances in graphic technologies on both software and hardware aspects. While photorealistic avatars are increasingly used in industrial <b>simulations,</b> representing human factors such as human workers internal states, remains a challenge. This article addresses this issue by introducing the concept of MetaStates which are the digitization and representation of the psychophysiological states of a human worker in the digital world. The MetaStates influence the physical representation and performance of a digital human worker while performing a task. To demonstrate this concept the study presents a development of a photorealistic avatar which is integrated into a simulated environment and enhanced with a multi-level graphical representation of different psychophysiological states. This approach represents a major step forward in the use of digital humans for industrial <b>simulations,</b> allowing companies to better leverage the benefits of the Industrial Metaverse in their daily operations and <b>simulations</b> while keeping human workers at the center of the system.

**ABSTRACT**  
Intensive care unit (ICU) patients often develop new health-related problems in their long-term recovery. Health care professionals keeping a diary of a patient's stay is a proven strategy to tackle this but faces several adoption barriers, such as lack of time and difficulty in knowing what to write. <b>Large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> <b>(LLMs),</b> with their ability to generate human-like text and adaptability, could solve these challenges. However, realizing this vision involves addressing several socio-technical and practical research challenges. This paper discusses these challenges and proposes future research directions to utilize the potential of <b>LLMs</b> in ICU diary writing, ultimately improving the long-term recovery outcomes for ICU patients.

**ABSTRACT**  
The paper introduces Hands-Free VR, a voice-based natural-language interface for VR. The user gives a command using their voice, the speech audio data is converted to text using a speech-to-text deep learning model that is <b>fine-tuned</b> for robustness to word phonetic similarity and to spoken English accents, and the text is mapped to an executable VR command using a <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>model</b> that is robust to natural language diversity. Hands-Free VR was evaluated in a controlled within-subjects study (N = 22) that asked participants to find specific objects and to place them in various configurations. In the control condition participants used a conventional VR user interface to grab, carry, and position the objects using the handheld controllers. In the experimental condition participants used Hands-Free VR. The results confirm that: (1) Hands-Free VR is robust to spoken English accents, as for 20 of our participants English was not their first language, and to word phonetic similarity, correctly transcribing the voice command 96.71% of the time; (2) Hands-Free VR is robust to natural language diversity, correctly mapping the transcribed command to an executable command in 97.83% of the time; (3) Hands-Free VR had a significant efficiency advantage over the conventional VR interface in terms of task completion time, total viewpoint translation, total view direction rotation, and total left and right hand translations; (4) Hands-Free VR received high user preference ratings in terms of ease of use, intuitiveness, ergonomics, reliability, and desirability.

**ABSTRACT**  
In the field of affective computing, where research continually advances at a rapid pace, the demand for user-friendly tools has become increasingly apparent. In this paper, we present the AffectToolbox, a novel software system that aims to support researchers in developing affect-sensitive studies and prototypes. The proposed system addresses the challenges posed by existing frameworks, which often require profound programming knowledge and cater primarily to power-users or skilled developers. Aiming to facilitate ease of use, the AffectToolbox requires no programming knowledge and offers its functionality to reliably analyze the affective state of users through an accessible graphical user interface. The architecture encompasses a variety of models for <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> on multiple affective channels and modalities, as well as an elaborate fusion system to merge <b>multi-modal</b> assessments into a unified result. The entire system is open-sourced and will be publicly available to ensure easy integration into more complex applications through a well-structured, Python-based code base - therefore marking a substantial contribution toward advancing affective computing research and fostering a more collaborative and inclusive environment within this interdisciplinary field.

**ABSTRACT**  
This article proposes a method to uncover opportunities for exploitation and exploration from consumer IoT interaction data. We develop a unique decomposition of cosine similarity that quantifies exploitation through functional similarity of interactions, exploration through cross-capacity similarity of <b>counterfactual</b> interactions, and differentiation of the two opportunities through within-similarity. We propose a topological data analysis method that incorporates these components of similarity and provides for their visualization. Functionally similar automations reveal exploitation opportunities for substitutes-in-use or complements-in-use, while exploration opportunities extend functionality into new use cases. This data-driven approach provides marketers with a powerful capability to discover possibilities for refining existing automation features while exploring new innovations. More generally, our approach can aid marketing efforts to balance these strategic opportunities in high technology contexts.

**ABSTRACT**  
Designers often create visualizations to achieve specific high-level analytical or communication goals. These goals require people to naturally extract complex, contextualized, and interconnected patterns in data. While limited prior work has studied general high-level interpretation, prevailing perceptual studies of visualization effectiveness primarily focus on isolated, predefined, low-level tasks, such as estimating statistical quantities. This study more holistically explores visualization interpretation to examine the alignment between designers' communicative goals and what their audience sees in a visualization, which we refer to as their comprehension. We found that statistics people effectively estimate from visualizations in classical graphical perception studies may differ from the patterns people intuitively comprehend in a visualization. We conducted a qualitative study on three types of visualizations -- line <b>graphs,</b> bar <b>graphs,</b> and scatterplots -- to investigate the high-level patterns people naturally draw from a visualization. Participants described a series of <b>graphs</b> using natural language and think-aloud protocols. We found that comprehension varies with a range of factors, including <b>graph</b> complexity and data distribution. Specifically, 1) a visualization's stated objective often does not align with people's comprehension, 2) results from traditional experiments may not predict the knowledge people build with a <b>graph,</b> and 3) chart type alone is insufficient to predict the information people extract from a <b>graph.</b> Our study confirms the importance of defining visualization effectiveness from multiple perspectives to assess and inform visualization practices.

**ABSTRACT**  
Generation of science-ready data from processed data products is one of the major challenges in next-generation radio continuum surveys with the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) and its precursors, due to the expected data volume and the need to achieve a high degree of automated processing. Source extraction, characterization, and classification are the major stages involved in this process. In this work we focus on the classification of compact radio sources in the Galactic plane using both radio and infrared images as inputs. To this aim, we produced a curated dataset of ~20,000 images of compact sources of different astronomical classes, obtained from past radio and infrared surveys, and novel radio data from pilot surveys carried out with the Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP). Radio spectral index information was also obtained for a subset of the data. We then trained two different classifiers on the produced dataset. The first model uses gradient-boosted decision trees and is trained on a set of pre-computed features derived from the data, which include radio-infrared colour indices and the radio spectral index. The second model is trained directly on multi-channel images, employing <b>convolutional</b> <b>neural</b> <b>networks.</b> Using a completely <b>supervised</b> procedure, we obtained a high classification accuracy (F1-score>90%) for separating Galactic objects from the extragalactic background. Individual class discrimination performances, ranging from 60% to 75%, increased by 10% when adding far-infrared and spectral index information, with extragalactic objects, PNe and HII regions identified with higher accuracies. The implemented tools and trained models were publicly released, and made available to the radioastronomical community for future application on new radio data.

**ABSTRACT**  
Affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM), tailored as a novel multicarrier technique utilizing chirp signals for high-mobility communications, exhibits marked advantages compared to traditional orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). AFDM is based on the discrete affine Fourier transform (DAFT) with two modifiable parameters of the chirp signals, termed as the pre-chirp parameter and post-chirp parameter, respectively. These parameters can be <b>fine-tuned</b> to avoid overlapping channel paths with different delays or Doppler shifts, leading to performance enhancement especially for doubly dispersive channel. In this paper, we propose a novel AFDM structure with the pre-chirp index modulation (PIM) philosophy (AFDM-PIM), which can embed additional information bits into the pre-chirp parameter design for both spectral and energy efficiency enhancement. Specifically, we first demonstrate that the application of distinct pre-chirp parameters to various subcarriers in the AFDM modulation process maintains the orthogonality among these subcarriers. Then, different pre-chirp parameters are flexibly assigned to each AFDM subcarrier according to the incoming bits. By such arrangement, aside from classical phase/amplitude modulation, extra binary bits can be implicitly conveyed by the indices of selected pre-chirping parameters realizations without additional energy consumption. At the receiver, both a maximum likelihood (ML) detector and a reduced-complexity ML-minimum mean square error (ML-MMSE) detector are employed to recover the information bits. It has been shown via <b>simulations</b> that the proposed AFDM-PIM exhibits superior bit error rate (BER) performance compared to classical AFDM, OFDM and IM-aided OFDM algorithms.

**ABSTRACT**  
While iterative matrix inversion methods excel in computational efficiency, memory optimization, and support for parallel and distributed computing when managing large matrices, their limitations are also evident in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) fading channels. These methods encounter challenges related to slow convergence and diminished accuracy, especially in ill-conditioned scenarios, hindering their application in future MIMO networks such as extra-large aperture array (ELAA). To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel matrix regularization method termed symmetric rank-$1$ regularization (SR-$1$R). The proposed method functions by augmenting the channel matrix with a symmetric rank-$1$ matrix, with the primary goal of minimizing the condition number of the resultant regularized matrix. This significantly improves the matrix condition, enabling fast and accurate iterative inversion of the regularized matrix. Then, the inverse of the original channel matrix is obtained by applying the Sherman-Morrison transform on the outcome of iterative inversions. Our eigenvalue analysis unveils the best channel condition that can be achieved by an optimized SR-$1$R matrix. Moreover, a power iteration-assisted (PIA) approach is proposed to find the optimum SR-$1$R matrix without need of eigenvalue decomposition. The proposed approach exhibits logarithmic algorithm-depth in parallel computing for MIMO precoding. Finally, computer <b>simulations</b> demonstrate that SR-$1$R has the potential to reduce iterative iterations by up to $33\%$, while also significantly improve symbol error probability by approximately an order of magnitude.

**ABSTRACT**  
The desire to empower resource-limited edge devices with computer vision (CV) must overcome the high energy consumption of collecting and processing vast sensory data. To address the challenge, this work proposes an energy-efficient non-von-Neumann in-pixel processing solution for neuromorphic vision sensors employing emerging (X) magnetic domain wall magnetic tunnel junction (MDWMTJ) for the first time, in conjunction with CMOS-based neuromorphic pixels. Our hybrid CMOS+X approach performs in-situ massively parallel asynchronous analog <b>convolution,</b> exhibiting low power consumption and high accuracy across various CV applications by leveraging the non-volatility and programmability of the MDWMTJ. Moreover, our developed device-circuit-algorithm co-design framework captures device constraints (low tunnel-magnetoresistance, low dynamic range) and circuit constraints (non-linearity, process variation, area consideration) based on monte-carlo <b>simulations</b> and device parameters utilizing GF22nm FD-SOI technology. Our experimental results suggest we can achieve an average of 45.3% reduction in backend-processor energy, maintaining similar front-end energy compared to the state-of-the-art and high accuracy of 79.17% and 95.99% on the DVS-CIFAR10 and IBM DVS128-Gesture datasets, respectively.

**ABSTRACT**  
Hyper-relational <b>knowledge</b> <b>graphs</b> <b>(KGs)</b> contain additional key-value pairs, providing more information about the relations. In many scenarios, the same relation can have distinct key-value pairs, making the original triple fact more recognizable and specific. Prior studies on hyper-relational <b>KGs</b> have established a solid standard method for hyper-relational <b>graph</b> encoding. In this work, we propose a <b>message-passing-based</b> <b>graph</b> encoder with global relation structure awareness ability, which we call ReSaE. Compared to the prior state-of-the-art approach, ReSaE emphasizes the interaction of relations during message passing process and optimizes the readout structure for link prediction tasks. Overall, ReSaE gives a encoding solution for hyper-relational <b>KGs</b> and ensures stronger performance on downstream link prediction tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that ReSaE achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple link prediction <b>benchmarks.</b> Furthermore, we also analyze the influence of different model structures on model performance.

**ABSTRACT**  
Autonomous agents powered by <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> <b>(LLMs)</b> have garnered significant research attention. However, fully harnessing the potential of <b>LLMs</b> for agent-based tasks presents inherent challenges due to the heterogeneous nature of diverse data sources featuring multi-turn trajectories. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{AgentOhana} as a comprehensive solution to address these challenges. \textit{AgentOhana} aggregates agent trajectories from distinct environments, spanning a wide array of scenarios. It meticulously standardizes and unifies these trajectories into a consistent format, streamlining the creation of a generic data loader optimized for agent training. Leveraging the data unification, our training pipeline maintains equilibrium across different data sources and preserves independent randomness across devices during dataset partitioning and model training. Additionally, we present \textbf{xLAM-v0.1}, a <b>large</b> <b>action</b> <b>model</b> tailored for AI agents, which demonstrates exceptional performance across various <b>benchmarks.</b>

**ABSTRACT**  
The rapid evolution of automated vehicles (AVs) has the potential to provide safer, more efficient, and comfortable travel options. However, these systems face challenges regarding reliability in complex driving scenarios. Recent explainable AV architectures neglect crucial information related to inherent uncertainties while providing explanations for actions. To overcome such challenges, our study builds upon the "object-induced" model approach that prioritizes the role of objects in scenes for decision-making and integrates uncertainty assessment into the decision-making process using an evidential deep learning paradigm with a Beta prior. Additionally, we explore several advanced training strategies guided by uncertainty, including uncertainty-guided data reweighting and augmentation. Leveraging the BDD-OIA dataset, our findings underscore that the model, through these enhancements, not only offers a clearer comprehension of AV decisions and their underlying <b>reasoning</b> but also surpasses existing baselines across a broad range of scenarios.

**ABSTRACT**  
Aligning lattices based on local stress distribution is crucial for achieving exceptional structural stiffness. However, this aspect has primarily been investigated under a single load condition, where stress in 2D can be described by two orthogonal principal stress directions. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for designing and optimizing triangular lattice structures to accommodate multiple loading conditions, which means multiple stress fields. Our method comprises two main steps: homogenization-based topology optimization and <b>geometry-based</b> de-homogenization. To ensure the geometric regularity of triangular lattices, we propose a simplified version of the general rank-$3$ laminate and parameterize the design domain using equilateral triangles with unique thickness per edge. During optimization, the thicknesses and orientation of each equilateral triangle are adjusted based on the homogenized properties of triangular lattices. Our numerical findings demonstrate that this proposed simplification results in only a slight decrease in stiffness, while achieving triangular lattice structures with a compelling geometric regularity. In <b>geometry-based</b> de-homogenization, we adopt a field-aligned triangulation approach to generate a globally consistent triangle mesh, with each triangle oriented according to the optimized orientation field. Our approach for handling multiple loading conditions, akin to de-homogenization techniques for single loading conditions, yields highly detailed, optimized, spatially varying lattice structures. The method is computationally efficient, as <b>simulations</b> and optimizations are conducted at a low-resolution discretization of the design domain. Furthermore, since our approach is <b>geometry-based,</b> obtained structures are encoded into a compact geometric format that facilitates downstream operations such as editing and fabrication.

**ABSTRACT**  
Reduced-order models (ROMs) allow for the <b>simulation</b> of blood flow in patient-specific vasculatures without the high computational cost and wait time associated with traditional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models. Unfortunately, due to the simplifications made in their formulations, ROMs can suffer from significantly reduced accuracy. One common simplifying assumption is the continuity of static or total pressure over vascular junctions. In many cases, this assumption has been shown to introduce significant error. We propose a model to account for this pressure difference, with the ultimate goal of increasing the accuracy of cardiovascular ROMs. Our model successfully uses a structure common in existing ROMs in conjunction with machine-learning techniques to predict the pressure difference over a vascular bifurcation. We analyze the performance of our model on steady and transient flows, testing it on three bifurcation cohorts representing three different bifurcation geometric types. We also compare the efficacy of different machine-learning techniques and two different model modalities.

**ABSTRACT**  
Feedback control synthesis for large-scale particle systems is reviewed in the framework of model predictive control (MPC). The high-dimensional character of collective dynamics hampers the performance of traditional MPC algorithms based on fast online dynamic optimization at every time step. Two alternatives to MPC are proposed. First, the use of <b>supervised</b> <b>learning</b> techniques for the offline approximation of optimal feedback laws is discussed. Then, a procedure based on sequential linearization of the dynamics based on macroscopic quantities of the particle ensemble is reviewed. Both approaches circumvent the online solution of optimal control problems enabling fast, real-time, feedback synthesis for large-scale particle systems. Numerical experiments assess the performance of the proposed algorithms.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper presents a novel control design for vehicular formations, which is an alternative to the conventional second-order consensus protocol. The design is motivated by the closed-loop system, which we construct as first-order systems connected in series, and is therefore called serial consensus. The serial consensus design will guarantee stability of the closed-loop system under the minimum requirement of the underlying communication <b>graphs</b> each containing a connected spanning tree -- something that is not true in general for the conventional consensus protocols. Here, we show that the serial consensus design also gives guarantees on the worst-case transient behavior of the formation, which are independent of the number of vehicles and the underlying <b>graph</b> structure. In particular this shows that the serial consensus design can be used to guarantee string stability of the formation, and is therefore suitable for directed formations. We show that it can be implemented through message passing or measurements to neighbors at most two hops away. The results are illustrated through numerical examples.

**ABSTRACT**  
We propose a high order numerical scheme for time-dependent first order Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman equations. In particular we propose to combine a semi-Lagrangian scheme with a Central Weighted Non-Oscillatory reconstruction. We prove a convergence result in the case of state- and time-independent Hamiltonians. Numerical <b>simulations</b> are presented in space dimensions one and two, also for more general state- and time-dependent Hamiltonians, demonstrating superior performance in terms of CPU time gain compared with a semi-Lagrangian scheme coupled with Weighted Non-Oscillatory reconstructions.

**ABSTRACT**  
Numerical <b>simulation</b> of moving immersed solid bodies in fluids is now practiced routinely following pioneering work of Peskin and co-workers on immersed boundary method (IBM), Glowinski and co-workers on fictitious domain method (FDM), and others on related methods. A variety of variants of IBM and FDM approaches have been published, most of which rely on using a background mesh for the fluid equations and tracking the solid body using Lagrangian points. The key idea that is common to these methods is to assume that the entire fluid-solid domain is a fluid and then to constrain the fluid within the solid domain to move in accordance with the solid governing equations. The immersed solid body can be rigid or deforming. Thus, in all these methods the fluid domain is extended into the solid domain. In this review, we provide a mathemarical perspective of various immersed methods by recasting the governing equations in an extended domain form for the fluid. The solid equations are used to impose appropriate constraints on the fluid that is extended into the solid domain. This leads to extended domain constrained fluid-solid governing equations that provide a unified framework for various immersed body techniques. The unified constrained governing equations in the strong form are independent of the temporal or spatial discretization schemes. We show that particular choices of time stepping and spatial discretization lead to different techniques reported in literature ranging from freely moving rigid to elastic self-propelling bodies. These techniques have wide ranging applications including aquatic locomotion, underwater vehicles, car aerodynamics, and organ physiology (e.g. cardiac flow, esophageal transport, respiratory flows), wave energy convertors, among others. We conclude with comments on outstanding challenges and future directions.

**ABSTRACT**  
Safe <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning</b> (Safe RL) refers to a class of techniques that aim to prevent RL algorithms from violating constraints in the process of decision-making and exploration during trial and error. In this paper, a novel model-free Safe RL algorithm, formulated based on the multi-objective policy optimization framework is introduced where the policy is optimized towards optimality and safety, simultaneously. The optimality is achieved by the environment reward function that is subsequently shaped using a safety critic. The advantage of the Safety Optimized RL (SORL) algorithm compared to the traditional Safe RL algorithms is that it omits the need to constrain the policy search space. This allows SORL to find a natural tradeoff between safety and optimality without compromising the performance in terms of either safety or optimality due to strict search space constraints. Through our theoretical analysis of SORL, we propose a condition for SORL's converged policy to guarantee safety and then use it to introduce an aggressiveness parameter that allows for <b>fine-tuning</b> the mentioned tradeoff. The experimental results obtained in seven different robotic environments indicate a considerable reduction in the number of safety violations along with higher, or competitive, policy returns, in comparison to six different state-of-the-art Safe RL methods. The results demonstrate the significant superiority of the proposed SORL algorithm in safety-critical applications.

**ABSTRACT**  
We study the asymptotic error of score-based <b>diffusion</b> <b>model</b> sampling in large-sample scenarios from a non-parametric statistics perspective. We show that a kernel-based score estimator achieves an optimal mean square error of $\widetilde{O}\left(n^{-1} t^{-\frac{d+2}{2}}(t^{\frac{d}{2}} \vee 1)\right)$ for the score function of $p_0*\mathcal{N}(0,t\boldsymbol{I}_d)$, where $n$ and $d$ represent the <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> and the dimension, $t$ is bounded above and below by polynomials of $n$, and $p_0$ is an arbitrary sub-Gaussian distribution. As a consequence, this yields an $\widetilde{O}\left(n^{-1/2} t^{-\frac{d}{4}}\right)$ upper bound for the total variation error of the distribution of the <b>sample</b> <b>generated</b> by the <b>diffusion</b> <b>model</b> under a mere sub-Gaussian assumption. If in addition, $p_0$ belongs to the nonparametric family of the $\beta$-Sobolev space with $\beta\le 2$, by adopting an early stopping strategy, we obtain that the <b>diffusion</b> <b>model</b> is nearly (up to log factors) minimax optimal. This removes the crucial lower bound assumption on $p_0$ in previous proofs of the minimax optimality of the <b>diffusion</b> <b>model</b> for nonparametric families.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Clustering</b> is a pivotal challenge in <b>unsupervised</b> machine learning and is often investigated through the lens of mixture models. The optimal error rate for recovering cluster labels in Gaussian and sub-Gaussian mixture models involves ad hoc signal-to-noise ratios. Simple iterative algorithms, such as Lloyd's algorithm, attain this optimal error rate. In this paper, we first establish a universal lower bound for the error rate in <b>clustering</b> any mixture model, expressed through a Chernoff divergence, a more versatile measure of model information than signal-to-noise ratios. We then demonstrate that iterative algorithms attain this lower bound in mixture models with sub-exponential tails, notably emphasizing location-scale mixtures featuring Laplace-distributed errors. Additionally, for datasets better modelled by Poisson or Negative Binomial mixtures, we study mixture models whose distributions belong to an exponential family. In such mixtures, we establish that Bregman hard <b>clustering,</b> a variant of Lloyd's algorithm employing a Bregman divergence, is rate optimal.

**ABSTRACT**  
Motivated by the problem of matching two correlated random geometric <b>graphs,</b> we study the problem of matching two Gaussian geometric models correlated through a latent node permutation. Specifically, given an unknown permutation $\pi^*$ on $\{1,\ldots,n\}$ and given $n$ i.i.d. pairs of correlated Gaussian vectors $\{X_{\pi^*(i)},Y_i\}$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with noise parameter $\sigma$, we consider two types of (correlated) weighted complete <b>graphs</b> with edge weights given by $A_{i,j}=\langle X_i,X_j \rangle$, $B_{i,j}=\langle Y_i,Y_j \rangle$. The goal is to recover the hidden vertex correspondence $\pi^*$ based on the observed matrices $A$ and $B$. For the low-dimensional regime where $d=O(\log n)$, Wang, Wu, Xu, and Yolou [WWXY22+] established the information thresholds for exact and almost exact recovery in matching correlated Gaussian geometric models. They also conducted numerical experiments for the classical Umeyama algorithm. In our work, we prove that this algorithm achieves exact recovery of $\pi^*$ when the noise parameter $\sigma=o(d^{-3}n^{-2/d})$, and almost exact recovery when $\sigma=o(d^{-3}n^{-1/d})$. Our results approach the information thresholds up to a $\operatorname{poly}(d)$ factor in the low-dimensional regime.

**ABSTRACT**  
Examining the impact of disasters on life activities of populations is critical for understanding community resilience dynamics, yet it remains insufficiently studied in the existing literature. In this study, we leveraged data from more than 1.2 million anonymized human mobility communications across 30 parishes in Louisiana to construct a temporal network that tracks visitation to places from which we characterized human lifestyle signatures before, during, and after Hurricane Ida in 2021. Utilizing the motif model, we <b>distilled</b> complex human lifestyles into identifiable patterns and clustered them into classes: commute, healthcare, dining out, and youth-oriented lifestyle. We defined two metrics to evaluate disruption and recovery fluctuations in lifestyle patterns during the perturbation period compared to the steady period: 1) frequency (daily number of motifs), and 2) proximity (daily average distance of motifs). The results indicate significant dynamics in lifestyle patterns due to the hurricane, with essential facilities (e.g., healthcare) demonstrating a swift recovery. The study underscores the heterogeneity of locations visited and the necessity of integrating both essential and non-essential facilities into disaster response initiatives. Furthermore, our study reveals sustained changes in lifestyle patterns, highlighting the long-term impact of the hurricane on daily life. These insights demonstrate the significance of examining lifestyle signatures and their fluctuations in evaluating disaster resilience patterns for affected communities. The outcomes of this study are poised to aid emergency managers and public officials to more effectively evaluate and monitor disaster impacts and recovery based on changes in lifestyle patterns in the community.

**ABSTRACT**  
Complex networks pervade various real-world systems, from the natural environment to human societies. The essence of these networks is in their ability to transition and evolve from microscopic disorder-where network topology and node dynamics intertwine-to a macroscopic order characterized by certain collective behaviors. Over the past two decades, complex network science has significantly enhanced our understanding of the statistical mechanics, structures, and dynamics underlying real-world networks. Despite these advancements, there remain considerable challenges in exploring more realistic systems and enhancing practical applications. The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, coupled with the abundance of diverse real-world network data, has heralded a new era in complex network science research. This survey aims to systematically address the potential advantages of AI in overcoming the lingering challenges of complex network research. It endeavors to <b>summarize</b> the pivotal research problems and provide an exhaustive review of the corresponding methodologies and applications. Through this comprehensive survey-the first of its kind on AI for complex networks-we expect to provide valuable insights that will drive further research and advancement in this interdisciplinary field.

**ABSTRACT**  
Split <b>federated</b> <b>learning</b> (SFL) is a recent distributed approach for collaborative model training among multiple clients. In SFL, a global model is typically split into two parts, where clients train one part in a parallel <b>federated</b> <b>manner,</b> and a main server trains the other. Despite the recent research on SFL algorithm development, the convergence analysis of SFL is missing in the literature, and this paper aims to fill this gap. The analysis of SFL can be more challenging than that of <b>federated</b> <b>learning</b> (FL), due to the potential dual-paced updates at the clients and the main server. We provide convergence analysis of SFL for strongly convex and general convex objectives on heterogeneous data. The convergence rates are $O(1/T)$ and $O(1/\sqrt[3]{T})$, respectively, where $T$ denotes the total number of rounds for SFL training. We further extend the analysis to non-convex objectives and where some clients may be unavailable during training. Numerical experiments validate our theoretical results and show that SFL outperforms FL and split learning (SL) when data is highly heterogeneous across a large number of clients.

**ABSTRACT**  
Core decomposition is a well-established <b>graph</b> mining problem with various applications that involves partitioning the <b>graph</b> into hierarchical subgraphs. Solutions to this problem have been developed using both bottom-up and top-down approaches from the perspective of vertex convergence dependency. However, existing algorithms have not effectively harnessed GPU performance to expedite core decomposition, despite the growing need for enhanced performance. Moreover, approaching performance limitations of core decomposition from two different directions within a parallel synchronization structure has not been thoroughly explored. This paper introduces an efficient GPU acceleration framework, PICO, for the Peel and Index2core paradigms of k-core decomposition. We propose PeelOne, a Peel-based algorithm designed to simplify the parallel logic and minimize atomic operations by eliminating vertices that are 'under-core'. We also propose an Index2core-based algorithm, named HistoCore, which addresses the issue of extensive redundant computations across both vertices and edges. Extensive experiments on NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU show that PeelOne outperforms all other Peel-based algorithms, and HistoCore outperforms all other Index2core-based algorithms. Furthermore, HistoCore even outperforms PeelOne by 1.1x - 3.2x speedup on six datasets, which breaks the stereotype that the Index2core paradigm performs much worse than the Peel in a shared memory parallel setting.

**ABSTRACT**  
Constrained maximization of submodular functions poses a central problem in combinatorial optimization. In many realistic scenarios, a number of agents need to maximize multiple submodular objectives over the same ground set. We study such a setting, where the different solutions must be disjoint, and thus, questions of <b>fairness</b> arise. Inspired from the fair division literature, we suggest a simple round-robin protocol, where agents are allowed to build their solutions one item at a time by taking turns. Unlike what is typical in fair division, however, the prime goal here is to provide a fair algorithmic environment; each agent is allowed to use any algorithm for constructing their respective solutions. We show that just by following simple greedy policies, agents have solid guarantees for both monotone and non-monotone objectives, and for combinatorial constraints as general as $p$-systems (which capture cardinality and matroid intersection constraints). In the monotone case, our results include approximate EF1-type guarantees and their implications in fair division may be of independent interest. Further, although following a greedy policy may not be optimal in general, we show that consistently performing better than that is computationally hard.

**ABSTRACT**  
Network sparsification is the task of reducing the number of edges of a given <b>graph</b> while preserving some crucial <b>graph</b> property. In community-aware network sparsification, the preserved property concerns the subgraphs that are induced by the communities of the <b>graph</b> which are given as vertex subsets. This is formalized in the $\Pi$-Network Sparsification problem: given an edge-weighted <b>graph</b> $G$, a collection $Z$ of $c$ subsets of $V(G)$ (communities), and two numbers $\ell, b$, the question is whether there exists a spanning subgraph $G'$ of $G$ with at most $\ell$ edges of total weight at most $b$ such that $G'[C]$ fulfills $\Pi$ for each community $C$. Here, we consider two <b>graph</b> properties $\Pi$: the connectivity property (Connectivity NWS) and the property of having a spanning star (Stars NWS). Since both problems are NP-hard, we study their parameterized and fine-grained complexity. We provide a tight $2^{\Omega(n^2+c)} poly(n+|Z|)$-time running time lower bound based on the ETH for both problems, where $n$ is the number of vertices in $G$. The lower bound holds even in the restricted case when all communities have size at most 4, $G$ is a clique, and every edge has unit weight. For the connectivity property, the unit weight case with $G$ being a clique is the well-studied problem of computing a hypergraph support with a minimum number of edges. We then study the complexity of both problems parameterized by the feedback edge number $t$ of the solution <b>graph</b> $G'$. For Stars NWS, we present an XP-algorithm for $t$. This answers an open question by Korach and Stern [Disc. Appl. Math. '08] who asked for the existence of polynomial-time algorithms for $t=0$. In contrast, we show for Connectivity NWS that known polynomial-time algorithms for $t=0$ [Korach and Stern, Math. Program. '03; Klemz et al., SWAT '14] cannot be extended by showing that Connectivity NWS is NP-hard for $t=1$.

**ABSTRACT**  
In many real world networks, there already exists a (not necessarily optimal) $k$-partitioning of the network. Oftentimes, one aims to find a $k$-partitioning with a smaller cut value for such networks by moving only a few nodes across partitions. The number of nodes that can be moved across partitions is often a constraint forced by budgetary limitations. Motivated by such real-world applications, we introduce and study the $r$-move $k$-partitioning~problem, a natural variant of the Multiway cut problem. Given a <b>graph,</b> a set of $k$ terminals and an initial partitioning of the <b>graph,</b> the $r$-move $k$-partitioning~problem aims to find a $k$-partitioning with the minimum-weighted cut among all the $k$-partitionings that can be obtained by moving at most $r$ non-terminal nodes to partitions different from their initial ones. Our main result is a polynomial time $3(r+1)$ approximation algorithm for this problem. We further show that this problem is $W[1]$-hard, and give an FPTAS for when $r$ is a small constant.

**ABSTRACT**  
We examine the possibility of approximating Maximum Vertex-Disjoint Shortest Paths. In this problem, the input is an edge-weighted (directed or undirected) $n$-vertex <b>graph</b> $G$ along with $k$ terminal pairs $(s_1,t_1),(s_2,t_2),\ldots,(s_k,t_k)$. The task is to connect as many terminal pairs as possible by pairwise vertex-disjoint paths such that each path is a shortest path between the respective terminals. Our work is anchored in the recent breakthrough by Lochet [SODA '21], which demonstrates the polynomial-time solvability of the problem for a fixed value of $k$. Lochet's result implies the existence of a polynomial-time $ck$-approximation for Maximum Vertex-Disjoint Shortest Paths, where $c \leq 1$ is a constant. Our first result suggests that this approximation algorithm is, in a sense, the best we can hope for. More precisely, assuming the gap-ETH, we exclude the existence of an $o(k)$-approximations within $f(k) \cdot $poly($n$) time for any function $f$ that only depends on $k$. Our second result demonstrates the infeasibility of achieving an approximation ratio of $n^{\frac{1}{2}-\varepsilon}$ in polynomial time, unless P = NP. It is not difficult to show that a greedy algorithm selecting a path with the minimum number of arcs results in a $\lceil\sqrt{\ell}\rceil$-approximation, where $\ell$ is the number of edges in all the paths of an optimal solution. Since $\ell \leq n$, this underscores the tightness of the $n^{\frac{1}{2}-\varepsilon}$-inapproximability bound. Additionally, we establish that Maximum Vertex-Disjoint Shortest Paths is fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by $\ell$ but does not admit a polynomial kernel. Our hardness results hold for undirected <b>graphs</b> with unit weights, while our positive results extend to scenarios where the input <b>graph</b> is directed and features arbitrary (non-negative) edge weights.

**ABSTRACT**  
Given a <b>graph</b> $G$ with a vertex threshold function $\tau$, consider a dynamic process in which any inactive vertex $v$ becomes activated whenever at least $\tau(v)$ of its neighbors are activated. A vertex set $S$ is called a target set if all vertices of $G$ would be activated when initially activating vertices of $S$. In the Minmax Target Set Reconfiguration problem, for a <b>graph</b> $G$ and its two target sets $X$ and $Y$, we wish to transform $X$ into $Y$ by repeatedly adding or removing a single vertex, using only target sets of $G$, so as to minimize the maximum size of any intermediate target set. We prove that it is NP-hard to approximate Minmax Target Set Reconfiguration within a factor of $2-o\left(\frac{1}{\operatorname{polylog} n}\right)$, where $n$ is the number of vertices. Our result establishes a tight lower bound on approximability of Minmax Target Set Reconfiguration, which admits a $2$-factor approximation algorithm. The proof is based on a gap-preserving reduction from Target Set Selection to Minmax Target Set Reconfiguration, where NP-hardness of approximation for the former problem is proven by Chen (SIAM J. Discrete Math., 2009) and Charikar, Naamad, and Wirth (APPROX/RANDOM 2016).

**ABSTRACT**  
Weak coin flipping is a cryptographic primitive in which two mutually distrustful parties generate a shared random bit to agree on a winner via remote communication. While a stand-alone secure weak coin flipping protocol can be constructed from noiseless communication channels, its composability has not been explored. In this work, we demonstrate that no weak coin flipping protocol can be abstracted into a <b>black</b> <b>box</b> resource with composable security. Despite this, we also establish the overall stand-alone security of weak coin flipping protocols under sequential composition.

**ABSTRACT**  
Let $G$ be a simple <b>graph</b> with adjacency matrix $A(G)$, signless Laplacian matrix $Q(G)$, degree diagonal matrix $D(G)$ and let $l(G)$ be the line <b>graph</b> of $G$. In 2017, Nikiforov defined the $A_\alpha$-matrix of $G$, $A_\alpha(G)$, as a linear convex combination of $A(G)$ and $D(G)$, the following way, $A_\alpha(G):=\alpha A(G)+(1-\alpha)D(G),$ where $\alpha\in[0,1]$. In this paper, we present some bounds for the eigenvalues of $A_\alpha(G)$ and for the largest and smallest eigenvalues of $A_\alpha(l(G))$. Extremal <b>graphs</b> attaining some of these bounds are characterized.

**ABSTRACT**  
We introduce the flower calculus, a deep inference proof system for intuitionistic first-order logic inspired by Peirce's existential <b>graphs.</b> It works as a rewriting system over inductive objects called "flowers", that enjoy both a graphical interpretation as topological diagrams, and a textual presentation as nested sequents akin to coherent formulas. Importantly, the calculus dispenses completely with the traditional notion of symbolic connective, operating solely on nested flowers containing atomic predicates. We prove both the soundness of the full calculus and the completeness of an analytic fragment with respect to Kripke semantics. This provides to our knowledge the first analyticity result for a proof system based on existential <b>graphs,</b> adapting semantic cut-elimination techniques to a deep inference setting. Furthermore, the kernel of rules targetted by completeness is fully invertible, a desirable property for both automated and interactive proof search.

**ABSTRACT**  
The crossing number of a <b>graph</b> $G$ is the minimum number of crossings in a drawing of $G$ in the plane. A rectilinear drawing of a <b>graph</b> $G$ represents vertices of $G$ by a set of points in the plane and represents each edge of $G$ by a straight-line segment connecting its two endpoints. The rectilinear crossing number of $G$ is the minimum number of crossings in a rectilinear drawing of $G$. By the crossing lemma, the crossing number of an $n$-vertex <b>graph</b> $G$ can be $O(n)$ only if $|E(G)|\in O(n)$. <b>Graphs</b> of bounded genus and bounded degree (B\"{o}r\"{o}czky, Pach and T\'{o}th, 2006) and in fact all bounded degree proper minor-closed families (Wood and Telle, 2007) have been shown to admit linear crossing number, with tight $\Theta(\Delta n)$ bound shown by Dujmovi\'c, Kawarabayashi, Mohar and Wood, 2008. Much less is known about rectilinear crossing number. It is not bounded by any function of the crossing number. We prove that <b>graphs</b> that exclude a single-crossing <b>graph</b> as a minor have the rectilinear crossing number $O(\Delta n)$. This dependence on $n$ and $\Delta$ is best possible. A single-crossing <b>graph</b> is a <b>graph</b> whose crossing number is at most one. Thus the result applies to $K_5$-minor-free <b>graphs,</b> for example. It also applies to bounded treewidth <b>graphs,</b> since each family of bounded treewidth <b>graphs</b> excludes some fixed planar <b>graph</b> as a minor. Prior to our work, the only bounded degree minor-closed families known to have linear rectilinear crossing number were bounded degree <b>graphs</b> of bounded treewidth (Wood and Telle, 2007), as well as, bounded degree $K_{3,3}$-minor-free <b>graphs</b> (Dujmovi\'c, Kawarabayashi, Mohar and Wood, 2008). In the case of bounded treewidth <b>graphs,</b> our $O(\Delta n)$ result is again tight and improves on the previous best known bound of $O(\Delta^2 n)$ by Wood and Telle, 2007 (obtained for convex geometric drawings).
