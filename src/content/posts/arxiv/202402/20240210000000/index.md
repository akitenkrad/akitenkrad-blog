**ABSTRACT**  
<b>In-context</b> <b>learning</b> (ICL, also known as <b>few-shot</b> prompting) has been the standard method of adapting LLMs to downstream tasks, by learning from a few input-output examples. Nonetheless, all ICL-based approaches only learn from correct input-output pairs. In this paper, we revisit this paradigm, by learning more from the few given input-output examples. We introduce Learning Principles (LEAP): First, we intentionally induce the model to make mistakes on these few examples; then we reflect on these mistakes, and learn explicit task-specific "principles" from them, which help solve similar problems and avoid common mistakes; finally, we <b>prompt</b> the model to answer unseen test questions using the original <b>few-shot</b> examples and these learned general principles. We evaluate LEAP on a wide range of benchmarks, including multi-hop <b>question</b> <b>answering</b> (Hotpot QA), textual <b>QA</b> (DROP), Big-Bench Hard reasoning, and math problems (GSM8K and MATH); in all these benchmarks, LEAP improves the strongest available LLMs such as GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, <b>GPT-4</b> <b>turbo</b> and Claude-2.1. For example, LEAP improves over the standard <b>few-shot</b> prompting using <b>GPT-4</b> by 7.5% in DROP, and by 3.3% in HotpotQA. Importantly, LEAP does not require any more input or examples than the standard <b>few-shot</b> prompting settings.

**ABSTRACT**  
Large Language Models (LLMs) are the cornerstone for many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks like sentiment analysis, document classification, named entity recognition, question answering, summarization, etc. LLMs are often trained on data which originates from the web. This data is prone to having content with Hate, Abuse and Profanity (HAP). For a detailed definition of HAP, please refer to the Appendix. Due to the LLMs being exposed to HAP content during training, the models learn it and may then generate hateful or profane content. For example, when the open-source <b>RoBERTa</b> model (specifically, the <b>RoBERTA</b> base model) from the HuggingFace (HF) Transformers library is prompted to replace the mask token in `I do not know that Persian people are that MASK` it returns the word `stupid` with the highest score. This is unacceptable in civil discourse.The detection of Hate, Abuse and Profanity in text is a vital component of creating civil and unbiased LLMs, which is needed not only for English, but for all languages. In this article, we briefly describe the creation of HAP detectors and various ways of using them to make models civil and acceptable in the output they generate.

**ABSTRACT**  
Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across diverse tasks and exhibited impressive <b>reasoning</b> abilities by applying <b>zero-shot</b> Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. However, due to the evolving nature of sentence prefixes during the pre-training phase, existing <b>zero-shot</b> CoT prompting methods that employ identical CoT prompting across all task instances may not be optimal. In this paper, we introduce a novel <b>zero-shot</b> prompting method that leverages evolutionary algorithms to generate diverse promptings for LLMs dynamically. Our approach involves initializing two CoT promptings, performing evolutionary operations based on LLMs to create a varied set, and utilizing the LLMs to select a suitable CoT prompting for a given problem. Additionally, a rewriting operation, guided by the selected CoT prompting, enhances the understanding of the LLMs about the problem. Extensive experiments conducted across ten <b>reasoning</b> datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method compared to current <b>zero-shot</b> CoT prompting methods on GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4. Moreover, in-depth analytical experiments underscore the adaptability and effectiveness of our method in various <b>reasoning</b> tasks.

**ABSTRACT**  
While recent work shows promising results in expanding the capabilities of large language models (LLM) to directly understand and synthesize speech, an LLM-based strategy for modeling spoken dialogs remains elusive and calls for further investigation. This work proposes an extensive speech-text <b>LLM</b> framework, named the Unified Spoken Dialog Model (USDM), to generate coherent spoken responses with organic prosodic features relevant to the given input speech without relying on <b>automatic</b> <b>speech</b> <b>recognition</b> (ASR) or <b>text-to-speech</b> (TTS) solutions. Our approach employs a multi-step speech-text inference scheme that leverages chain-of-reasoning capabilities exhibited by the underlying LLM. We also propose a generalized speech-text pretraining scheme that helps with capturing cross-modal semantics. Automatic and human evaluations show that the proposed approach is effective in generating natural-sounding spoken responses, outperforming both prior and cascaded baselines. Detailed comparative studies reveal that, despite the cascaded approach being stronger in individual components, the joint speech-text modeling improves robustness against recognition errors and speech quality. Demo is available at https://unifiedsdm.github.io.

**ABSTRACT**  
Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values is imperative to mitigate potential adverse effects resulting from their misuse. Drawing from the sociological insight that acknowledging all parties' concerns is a key factor in shaping human values, this paper proposes a novel direction to align LLMs by themselves: social scene simulation. To achieve this, we present MATRIX, a novel social scene simulator that emulates realistic scenes around a user's input query, enabling the <b>LLM</b> to take social consequences into account before responding. MATRIX serves as a virtual rehearsal space, akin to a Monopolylogue, where the <b>LLM</b> performs diverse roles related to the query and practice by itself. To inject this alignment, we <b>fine-tune</b> the <b>LLM</b> with MATRIX-simulated data, ensuring adherence to human values without compromising inference speed. We theoretically show that the <b>LLM</b> with MATRIX outperforms Constitutional AI under mild assumptions. Finally, extensive experiments validate that our method outperforms over 10 baselines across 4 benchmarks. As evidenced by 875 user ratings, our tuned 13B-size <b>LLM</b> exceeds <b>GPT-4</b> in aligning with human values. Code is available at https://github.com/pangxianghe/MATRIX.

**ABSTRACT**  
Cloud-based large language models (LLMs) such as <b>ChatGPT</b> have increasingly become integral to daily operations, serving as vital tools across various applications. While these models offer substantial benefits in terms of accessibility and functionality, they also introduce significant privacy concerns: the transmission and storage of user data in cloud infrastructures pose substantial risks of data breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive information; even if the transmission and storage of data is encrypted, the <b>LLM</b> service provider itself still knows the real contents of the data, preventing individuals or entities from confidently using such <b>LLM</b> services. To address these concerns, this paper proposes a simple yet effective mechanism PromptCrypt to protect user privacy. It uses Emoji to encrypt the user inputs before sending them to LLM, effectively rendering them indecipherable to human or LLM's examination while retaining the original intent of the prompt, thus ensuring the model's performance remains unaffected. We conduct experiments on three tasks, personalized recommendation, sentiment analysis, and tabular data analysis. Experiment results reveal that PromptCrypt can encrypt personal information within prompts in such a manner that not only prevents the discernment of sensitive data by humans or <b>LLM</b> itself, but also maintains or even improves the precision without further tuning, achieving comparable or even better task accuracy than directly prompting the <b>LLM</b> without <b>prompt</b> encryption. These results highlight the practicality of adopting encryption measures that safeguard user privacy without compromising the functional integrity and performance of LLMs. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/agiresearch/PromptCrypt.

**ABSTRACT**  
Despite remarkable advancements in emulating human-like behavior through Large Language Models (LLMs), current textual simulations do not adequately address the notion of time. To this end, we introduce TimeArena, a novel textual simulated environment that incorporates complex temporal dynamics and constraints that better reflect real-life planning scenarios. In TimeArena, agents are asked to complete multiple tasks as soon as possible, allowing for parallel processing to save time. We implement the dependency between actions, the time duration for each action, and the occupancy of the agent and the objects in the environment. TimeArena grounds to 30 real-world tasks in cooking, household activities, and laboratory work. We conduct extensive experiments with various state-of-the-art LLMs using TimeArena. Our findings reveal that even the most powerful models, e.g., GPT-4, still lag behind humans in effective multitasking, underscoring the need for enhanced temporal awareness in the development of language agents.

**ABSTRACT**  
Large Language Models (LLMs) play a pivotal role in generating vast arrays of narratives, facilitating a systematic exploration of their effectiveness for communicating life events in narrative form. In this study, we employ a <b>zero-shot</b> structured narrative <b>prompt</b> to generate 24,000 narratives using OpenAI's GPT-4. From this dataset, we manually classify 2,880 narratives and evaluate their validity in conveying birth, death, hiring, and firing events. Remarkably, 87.43% of the narratives sufficiently convey the intention of the structured prompt. To automate the identification of valid and invalid narratives, we train and validate nine Machine Learning models on the classified datasets. Leveraging these models, we extend our analysis to predict the classifications of the remaining 21,120 narratives. All the ML models excelled at classifying valid narratives as valid, but experienced challenges at simultaneously classifying invalid narratives as invalid. Our findings not only advance the study of <b>LLM</b> capabilities, limitations, and validity but also offer practical insights for narrative generation and natural language processing applications.

**ABSTRACT**  
We propose the problem of conversational web navigation, where a digital agent controls a web browser and follows user instructions to solve real-world tasks in a multi-turn dialogue fashion. To support this problem, we introduce WEBLINX - a large-scale benchmark of 100K interactions across 2300 expert demonstrations of conversational web navigation. Our benchmark covers a broad range of patterns on over 150 real-world websites and can be used to train and evaluate agents in diverse scenarios. Due to the magnitude of information present, Large Language Models (LLMs) cannot process entire web pages in real-time. To solve this bottleneck, we design a retrieval-inspired model that efficiently prunes HTML pages by ranking relevant elements. We use the selected elements, along with screenshots and action history, to assess a variety of models for their ability to replicate human behavior when navigating the web. Our experiments span from small text-only to proprietary multimodal LLMs. We find that smaller finetuned decoders surpass the best <b>zero-shot</b> LLMs (including GPT-4V), but also larger finetuned multimodal models which were explicitly pretrained on screenshots. However, all finetuned models struggle to generalize to unseen websites. Our findings highlight the need for large multimodal models that can generalize to novel settings. Our code, data and models are available for research: https://mcgill-nlp.github.io/weblinx

**ABSTRACT**  
Recent studies have successfully shown that large language models (LLMs) can be successfully used for generative error correction (GER) on top of the <b>automatic</b> <b>speech</b> <b>recognition</b> (ASR) output. Specifically, an <b>LLM</b> is utilized to carry out a direct mapping from the N-best hypotheses list generated by an <b>ASR</b> system to the predicted output transcription. However, despite its effectiveness, GER introduces extra data uncertainty since the <b>LLM</b> is trained without taking into account acoustic information available in the speech signal. In this work, we aim to overcome such a limitation by infusing acoustic information before generating the predicted transcription through a novel late fusion solution termed Uncertainty-Aware Dynamic Fusion (UADF). UADF is a multimodal fusion approach implemented into an auto-regressive decoding process and works in two stages: (i) It first analyzes and calibrates the token-level <b>LLM</b> decision, and (ii) it then dynamically assimilates the information from the acoustic modality. Experimental evidence collected from various <b>ASR</b> tasks shows that UADF surpasses existing fusion mechanisms in several ways. It yields significant improvements in word error rate (WER) while mitigating data uncertainty issues in <b>LLM</b> and addressing the poor generalization relied with sole modality during fusion. We also demonstrate that UADF seamlessly adapts to audio-visual speech recognition.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recent developments in large language models have sparked interest in efficient pretraining methods. A recent effective paradigm is to perform stage-wise training, where the size of the model is gradually increased over the course of training (e.g. gradual stacking (Reddi et al., 2023)). While the resource and wall-time savings are appealing, it has limitations, particularly the inability to evaluate the full model during earlier stages, and degradation in model quality due to smaller model capacity in the initial stages. In this work, we propose an alternative framework, progressive subnetwork training, that maintains the full model throughout training, but only trains subnetworks within the model in each step. We focus on a simple instantiation of this framework, Random Path Training (RaPTr) that only trains a sub-path of layers in each step, progressively increasing the path lengths in stages. RaPTr achieves better pre-training loss for <b>BERT</b> and UL2 language models while requiring 20-33% fewer FLOPs compared to standard training, and is competitive or better than other efficient training methods. Furthermore, RaPTr shows better downstream performance on UL2, improving <b>QA</b> tasks and <b>SuperGLUE</b> by 1-5% compared to standard training and stacking. Finally, we provide a theoretical basis for RaPTr to justify (a) the increasing complexity of subnetworks in stages, and (b) the stability in loss across stage transitions due to residual connections and layer norm.

**ABSTRACT**  
Large language models (LLMs) have played a pivotal role in building communicative AI to imitate human behaviors but face the challenge of efficient customization. To tackle this challenge, recent studies have delved into the realm of model editing, which manipulates specific memories of language models and changes the related language generation. However, the robustness of model editing remains an open question. This work seeks to understand the strengths and limitations of editing methods, thus facilitating robust, realistic applications of communicative AI. Concretely, we conduct extensive analysis to address the three key research questions. Q1: Can edited LLMs behave consistently resembling communicative AI in realistic situations? Q2: To what extent does the rephrasing of prompts lead LLMs to deviate from the edited knowledge memory? Q3: Which knowledge features are correlated with the performance and robustness of editing? Our experimental results uncover a substantial disparity between existing editing methods and the practical application of LLMs. On rephrased prompts that are complex and flexible but common in realistic applications, the performance of editing experiences a significant decline. Further analysis shows that more popular knowledge is memorized better, easier to recall, and more challenging to edit effectively.

**ABSTRACT**  
The aim of this study is to investigate <b>Machine</b> <b>Unlearning</b> (MU), a burgeoning field focused on addressing concerns related to neural models inadvertently retaining personal or sensitive data. Here, a novel approach is introduced to achieve precise and selective forgetting within language models. Unlike previous methodologies that adopt completely opposing training objectives, this approach aims to mitigate adverse effects on language model performance, particularly in generation tasks. Furthermore, two innovative evaluation metrics are proposed: Sensitive <b>Information</b> <b>Extraction</b> Likelihood (S-EL) and Sensitive Information Memory Accuracy (S-MA), designed to gauge the effectiveness of sensitive information elimination. To reinforce the forgetting framework, an effective method for annotating sensitive scopes is presented, involving both online and offline strategies. The online selection mechanism leverages language probability scores to ensure computational efficiency, while the offline annotation entails a robust two-stage process based on Large Language Models (LLMs).

**ABSTRACT**  
Large Language Models are prone to biased predictions and hallucinations, underlining the paramount importance of understanding their model-internal <b>reasoning</b> process. However, achieving faithful attributions for the entirety of a black-box <b>transformer</b> model and maintaining computational efficiency is an unsolved challenge. By extending the Layer-wise Relevance Propagation attribution method to handle attention layers, we address these challenges effectively. While partial solutions exist, our method is the first to faithfully and holistically attribute not only input but also latent representations of <b>transformer</b> models with the computational efficiency similar to a singular backward pass. Through extensive evaluations against existing methods on <b>Llama</b> 2, Flan-T5 and the Vision <b>Transformer</b> architecture, we demonstrate that our proposed approach surpasses alternative methods in terms of faithfulness and enables the understanding of latent representations, opening up the door for concept-based explanations. We provide an open-source implementation on GitHub https://github.com/rachtibat/LRP-for-Transformers.

**ABSTRACT**  
Text <b>data</b> <b>augmentation</b> is a complex problem due to the discrete nature of sentences. Although rule-based augmentation methods are widely adopted in real-world applications because of their simplicity, they suffer from potential semantic damage. Previous researchers have suggested easy <b>data</b> <b>augmentation</b> with soft labels (softEDA), employing <b>label</b> <b>smoothing</b> to mitigate this problem. However, finding the best factor for each model and dataset is challenging; therefore, using softEDA in real-world applications is still difficult. In this paper, we propose adapting AutoAugment to solve this problem. The experimental results suggest that the proposed method can boost existing augmentation methods and that rule-based methods can enhance cutting-edge pre-trained language models. We offer the source code.

**ABSTRACT**  
Traditional applications of natural language processing (NLP) in healthcare have predominantly focused on patient-centered services, enhancing patient interactions and care delivery, such as through medical dialogue systems. However, the potential of NLP to benefit inexperienced doctors, particularly in areas such as communicative medical coaching, remains largely unexplored. We introduce ``ChatCoach,'' an integrated human-AI cooperative framework. Within this framework, both a patient agent and a coaching agent collaboratively support medical learners in practicing their medical communication skills during consultations. Unlike traditional dialogue systems, ChatCoach provides a simulated environment where a human doctor can engage in medical dialogue with a patient agent. Simultaneously, a coaching agent provides real-time feedback to the doctor. To construct the ChatCoach system, we developed a dataset and integrated Large Language Models such as <b>ChatGPT</b> and Llama2, aiming to assess their effectiveness in communicative medical coaching tasks. Our comparative analysis demonstrates that instruction-tuned Llama2 significantly outperforms ChatGPT's prompting-based approaches.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>In-Context</b> <b>Learning</b> (ICL) is suffering from unsatisfactory performance and under-calibration due to high prior bias and unfaithful confidence. Some previous works fine-tuned language models for better <b>ICL</b> performance with enormous datasets and computing costs. In this paper, we propose NoisyICL, simply perturbing the model parameters by random noises to strive for better performance and calibration. Our experiments on 2 models and 12 downstream datasets show that NoisyICL can help <b>ICL</b> produce more accurate predictions. Our further analysis indicates that NoisyICL enables the model to provide more fair predictions, and also with less unfaithful confidence. Therefore, we believe that NoisyICL is an effective calibration of ICL. Our experimental code is uploaded to Github.

**ABSTRACT**  
Our society is facing rampant misinformation harming public health and trust. To address the societal challenge, we introduce FACT-GPT, a system leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the claim matching stage of fact-checking. FACT-GPT, trained on a synthetic dataset, identifies social media content that aligns with, contradicts, or is irrelevant to previously debunked claims. Our evaluation shows that our specialized LLMs can match the accuracy of larger models in identifying related claims, closely mirroring human judgment. This research provides an automated solution for efficient claim matching, demonstrates the potential of LLMs in supporting fact-checkers, and offers valuable resources for further research in the field.

**ABSTRACT**  
Speech technologies rely on capturing a speaker's voice variability while obtaining comprehensive language information. Textual prompts and sentence selection methods have been proposed in the literature to comprise such adequate phonetic data, referred to as a phonetically rich \textit{corpus}. However, they are still insufficient for acoustic modeling, especially critical for languages with limited resources. Hence, this paper proposes a novel approach and outlines the methodological aspects required to create a \textit{corpus} with broad phonetic coverage for a low-resourced language, Brazilian Portuguese. Our methodology includes text dataset collection up to a sentence selection algorithm based on triphone distribution. Furthermore, we propose a new phonemic classification according to acoustic-articulatory speech features since the absolute number of distinct triphones, or low-probability triphones, does not guarantee an adequate representation of every possible combination. Using our algorithm, we achieve a 55.8\% higher percentage of distinct triphones -- for samples of similar size -- while the currently available phonetic-rich corpus, CETUC and TTS-Portuguese, 12.6\% and 12.3\% in comparison to a non-phonetically rich dataset.

**ABSTRACT**  
We introduce SPIRIT-LM, a foundation multimodal language model that freely mixes text and speech. Our model is based on a pretrained text language model that we extend to the speech modality by continuously training it on text and speech units. Speech and text sequences are concatenated as a single set of tokens, and trained with a word-level interleaving method using a small automatically-curated speech-text parallel corpus. SPIRIT-LM comes in two versions: a BASE version that uses speech semantic units and an EXPRESSIVE version that models expressivity using pitch and style units in addition to the semantic units. For both versions, the text is encoded with subword BPE tokens. The resulting model displays both the semantic abilities of text models and the expressive abilities of speech models. Additionally, we demonstrate that SPIRIT-LM is able to learn new tasks in a <b>few-shot</b> fashion across modalities (i.e. ASR, TTS, Speech Classification).

**ABSTRACT**  
Data annotation is an essential step for constructing new datasets. However, the conventional approach of data annotation through crowdsourcing is both time-consuming and expensive. In addition, the complexity of this process increases when dealing with <b>low-resource</b> languages owing to the difference in the language pool of crowdworkers. To address these issues, this study proposes an autonomous annotation method by utilizing large language models, which have been recently demonstrated to exhibit remarkable performance. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed method is not just cost-efficient but also applicable for <b>low-resource</b> language annotation. Additionally, we constructed an image captioning dataset using our approach and are committed to open this dataset for future study. We have opened our source code for further study and reproducibility.

**ABSTRACT**  
In psycholinguistics, the creation of controlled materials is crucial to ensure that research outcomes are solely attributed to the intended manipulations and not influenced by extraneous factors. To achieve this, psycholinguists typically pretest linguistic materials, where a common pretest is to solicit plausibility judgments from human evaluators on specific sentences. In this work, we investigate whether Language Models (LMs) can be used to generate these plausibility judgements. We investigate a wide range of LMs across multiple linguistic structures and evaluate whether their plausibility judgements correlate with human judgements. We find that <b>GPT-4</b> plausibility judgements highly correlate with human judgements across the structures we examine, whereas other LMs correlate well with humans on commonly used syntactic structures. We then test whether this correlation implies that LMs can be used instead of humans for pretesting. We find that when coarse-grained plausibility judgements are needed, this works well, but when fine-grained judgements are necessary, even <b>GPT-4</b> does not provide satisfactory discriminative power.

**ABSTRACT**  
Large language models (LLMs) powered conversational search systems have already been used by hundreds of millions of people, and are believed to bring many benefits over conventional search. However, while decades of research and public discourse interrogated the risk of search systems in increasing selective exposure and creating echo chambers -- limiting exposure to diverse opinions and leading to opinion polarization, little is known about such a risk of LLM-powered conversational search. We conduct two experiments to investigate: 1) whether and how LLM-powered conversational search increases selective exposure compared to conventional search; 2) whether and how LLMs with opinion biases that either reinforce or challenge the user's view change the effect. Overall, we found that participants engaged in more biased information querying with LLM-powered conversational search, and an opinionated <b>LLM</b> reinforcing their views exacerbated this bias. These results present critical implications for the development of LLMs and conversational search systems, and the policy governing these technologies.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this paper, we propose a new decoding method called Permute-and-Flip (PF) decoder. It enjoys robustness properties similar to the standard sampling decoder, but is provably up to 2x better in its quality-robustness tradeoff than sampling and never worse than any other decoder. We also design a cryptographic watermarking scheme analogous to Aaronson's Gumbel watermark, but naturally tailored for PF decoder. The watermarking scheme does not change the distribution to sample, while allowing arbitrarily low false positive rate and high recall whenever the generated text has high entropy. Our experiments show that the PF decoder (and its watermarked counterpart) significantly outperform(s) naive sampling (and it's Gumbel watermarked counterpart) in terms of perplexity, while retaining the same robustness (and detectability), hence making it a promising new approach for <b>LLM</b> decoding. The code is available at https://github.com/XuandongZhao/pf-decoding

**ABSTRACT**  
Large pre-trained language models have recently been expanded and applied to programming language tasks with great success, often through further pre-training of a strictly-natural language model--where training sequences typically contain both natural and (linearised) programming language. Such approaches effectively map both modalities of the sequence into the same embedding space. However, programming language keywords (e.g. ``while'') often have very strictly defined semantics. As such, <b>transfer</b> <b>learning</b> from their natural language usage may not necessarily be beneficial to their code application and vise versa. Assuming an already pre-trained language model, in this work we investigate how sequence tokens can be adapted and represented differently, depending on which modality they belong to, and to the ultimate benefit of the downstream task. We experiment with separating embedding spaces between modalities during further model pre-training with modality-relative training objectives. We focus on text-to-code generation and observe consistent improvements across two backbone models and two test sets, measuring pass@$k$ and a novel incremental variation.

**ABSTRACT**  
Long-form generations from large language models (LLMs) contains a mix of factual and non-factual claims, making evaluating factuality difficult. To evaluate factual precision of long-form generations in a more fine-grained way, prior works propose to decompose long-form generations into multiple verifiable facts and verify those facts independently. The factuality of the generation is the proportion of verifiable facts among all the facts. Such methods assume that combining factual claims forms a factual paragraph. This paper shows that the assumption can be violated due to entity ambiguity. We show that LLMs can generate paragraphs that contain verifiable facts, but the facts are combined to form a non-factual paragraph due to entity ambiguity. We further reveal that existing factual precision metrics, including FActScore and citation recall, cannot properly evaluate the factuality of these non-factual paragraphs. To address this, we introduce an enhanced metric, D-FActScore, specifically designed for content with ambiguous entities. We evaluate the D-FActScores of people biographies generated with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We show that D-FActScore can better assess the factuality of paragraphs with entity ambiguity than FActScore. We also find that four widely used open-source LLMs tend to mix information of distinct entities to form non-factual paragraphs.

**ABSTRACT**  
We propose that small pretrained foundational generative language models with millions of parameters can be utilized as a general learning framework for sequence-based tasks. Our proposal overcomes the computational resource, skill set, and timeline challenges associated with training neural networks and language models from scratch. Further, our approach focuses on creating small and highly specialized models that can accurately execute a challenging task of which the base model is incapable of performing. We demonstrate that 125M, 350M, and 1.3B parameter pretrained foundational language models can be instruction fine-tuned with 10,000-to-1,000,000 instruction examples to achieve near state-of-the-art results on challenging cheminformatics tasks. We also demonstrate the role of successive language model <b>fine-tuning</b> epochs on improved outcomes, as well as the importance of both data formatting and pretrained foundational language model selection for instruction <b>fine-tuning</b> success.

**ABSTRACT**  
In the highly constrained context of <b>low-resource</b> language studies, we explore vector representations of speech from a pretrained model to determine their level of abstraction with regard to the audio signal. We propose a new <b>unsupervised</b> method using ABX tests on audio recordings with carefully curated metadata to shed light on the type of information present in the representations. ABX tests determine whether the representations computed by a multilingual speech model encode a given characteristic. Three experiments are devised: one on room acoustics aspects, one on linguistic genre, and one on phonetic aspects. The results confirm that the representations extracted from recordings with different linguistic/extra-linguistic characteristics differ along the same lines. Embedding more audio signal in one vector better discriminates extra-linguistic characteristics, whereas shorter snippets are better to distinguish segmental information. The method is fully unsupervised, potentially opening new research avenues for comparative work on under-documented languages.

**ABSTRACT**  
Background: Eating disorders are increasingly prevalent, and social networks offer valuable information. Objective: Our goal was to identify efficient machine learning models for categorizing tweets related to eating disorders. Methods: Over three months, we collected tweets about eating disorders. A 2,000-tweet subset was labeled for: (1) being written by individuals with eating disorders, (2) promoting eating disorders, (3) informativeness, and (4) scientific content. Both traditional machine learning and deep learning models were employed for classification, assessing accuracy, F1 score, and computational time. Results: From 1,058,957 collected tweets, transformer-based bidirectional encoder representations achieved the highest F1 scores (71.1%-86.4%) across all four categories. Conclusions: Transformer-based models outperform traditional techniques in classifying eating disorder-related tweets, though they require more computational resources.

**ABSTRACT**  
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) refer to the most common inquiries about specific content. They serve as content comprehension aids by simplifying topics and enhancing understanding through succinct presentation of information. In this paper, we address FAQ generation as a well-defined Natural Language Processing (NLP) task through the development of an end-to-end system leveraging text-to-text transformation models. We present a literature review covering traditional question-answering systems, highlighting their limitations when applied directly to the FAQ generation task. We propose our system capable of building FAQs from textual content tailored to specific domains, enhancing their accuracy and relevance. We utilise self-curated algorithms for obtaining optimal representation of information to be provided as input and also for ranking the question-answer pairs to maximise human comprehension. Qualitative human evaluation showcases the generated FAQs to be well-constructed and readable, while also utilising domain-specific constructs to highlight domain-based nuances and jargon in the original content.

**ABSTRACT**  
Rule-based text <b>data</b> <b>augmentation</b> is widely used for NLP tasks due to its simplicity. However, this method can potentially damage the original meaning of the text, ultimately hurting the performance of the model. To overcome this limitation, we propose a straightforward technique for applying soft labels to augmented data. We conducted experiments across seven different classification tasks and empirically demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed approach. We have publicly opened our source code for reproducibility.

**ABSTRACT**  
Despite recent community revelations about the advancements and potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in understanding Text-Attributed Graphs (TAG), the deployment of LLMs for production is hindered by their high computational and storage requirements, as well as long latencies during inference. Simultaneously, although traditional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are light weight and adept at learning structural features of graphs, their ability to grasp the complex semantics in TAGs is somewhat constrained for real applications. To address these limitations, we concentrate on the downstream task of <b>node</b> <b>classification</b> in TAG and propose a novel graph <b>knowledge</b> <b>distillation</b> framework, termed Linguistic Graph <b>Knowledge</b> <b>Distillation</b> (LinguGKD), using LLMs as teacher models and GNNs as student models for knowledge distillation. It involves TAG-oriented <b>instruction</b> <b>tuning</b> of <b>LLM</b> on designed <b>node</b> <b>classification</b> prompts, followed by aligning the hierarchically learned node features of the teacher <b>LLM</b> and the student <b>GNN</b> in latent space, employing a layer-adaptive <b>contrastive</b> <b>learning</b> strategy. Through extensive experiments on a variety of <b>LLM</b> and <b>GNN</b> models and multiple benchmark datasets, the proposed LinguGKD significantly boosts the student GNN's predictive accuracy and convergence rate, without the need of extra data or model parameters. Compared to teacher LLM, distilled <b>GNN</b> achieves superior inference speed equipped with much fewer computing and storage demands, when surpassing the teacher LLM's classification performance on some of benchmark datasets.

Foundation models, such as Large language Models (LLMs), have attracted significant amount of interest due to their large number of applications. Existing works show that appropriate <b>prompt</b> design, such as Chain-of-Thoughts, can unlock LLM's powerful capacity in diverse areas. However, when handling tasks involving repetitive sub-tasks and/or deceptive contents, such as arithmetic calculation and article-level <b>fake</b> <b>news</b> detection, existing prompting strategies either suffers from insufficient expressive power or intermediate errors triggered by hallucination. To make <b>LLM</b> more discerning to such intermediate errors, we propose to guide <b>LLM</b> with a Divide-and-Conquer program that simultaneously ensures superior expressive power and disentangles task decomposition, sub-task resolution, and resolution assembly process. Theoretic analysis reveals that our strategy can guide <b>LLM</b> to extend the expressive power of fixed-depth Transformer. Experiments indicate that our proposed method can achieve better performance than typical prompting strategies in tasks bothered by intermediate errors and deceptive contents, such as large integer multiplication, <b>hallucination</b> <b>detection</b> and misinformation detection.

**ABSTRACT**  
Negotiation is the basis of social interactions; humans negotiate everything from the price of cars to how to share common resources. With rapidly growing interest in using large language models (LLMs) to act as agents on behalf of human users, such <b>LLM</b> agents would also need to be able to negotiate. In this paper, we study how well LLMs can negotiate with each other. We develop NegotiationArena: a flexible framework for evaluating and probing the negotiation abilities of <b>LLM</b> agents. We implemented three types of scenarios in NegotiationArena to assess LLM's behaviors in allocating shared resources (ultimatum games), aggregate resources (trading games) and buy/sell goods (price negotiations). Each scenario allows for multiple turns of flexible dialogues between <b>LLM</b> agents to allow for more complex negotiations. Interestingly, <b>LLM</b> agents can significantly boost their negotiation outcomes by employing certain behavioral tactics. For example, by pretending to be desolate and desperate, LLMs can improve their payoffs by 20\% when negotiating against the standard GPT-4. We also quantify irrational negotiation behaviors exhibited by the <b>LLM</b> agents, many of which also appear in humans. Together, \NegotiationArena offers a new environment to investigate <b>LLM</b> interactions, enabling new insights into LLM's theory of mind, irrationality, and <b>reasoning</b> abilities.

**ABSTRACT**  
Large Language Models (LLMs) have become prevalent across diverse sectors, transforming human life with their extraordinary <b>reasoning</b> and comprehension abilities. As they find increased use in sensitive tasks, safety concerns have gained widespread attention. Extensive efforts have been dedicated to aligning LLMs with human moral principles to ensure their safe deployment. Despite their potential, recent research indicates aligned LLMs are prone to specialized jailbreaking prompts that bypass safety measures to elicit violent and harmful content. The intrinsic discrete nature and substantial scale of contemporary LLMs pose significant challenges in automatically generating diverse, efficient, and potent jailbreaking prompts, representing a continuous obstacle. In this paper, we introduce RIPPLE (Rapid Optimization via Subconscious Exploitation and Echopraxia), a novel optimization-based method inspired by two psychological concepts: subconsciousness and echopraxia, which describe the processes of the mind that occur without conscious awareness and the involuntary mimicry of actions, respectively. Evaluations across 6 open-source LLMs and 4 commercial <b>LLM</b> APIs show RIPPLE achieves an average Attack Success Rate of 91.5\%, outperforming five current methods by up to 47.0\% with an 8x reduction in overhead. Furthermore, it displays significant transferability and stealth, successfully evading established detection mechanisms. The code of our work is available at \url{https://github.com/SolidShen/RIPPLE_official/tree/official}

**ABSTRACT**  
In this paper, we propose R$^3$: Learning <b>Reasoning</b> through Reverse Curriculum <b>Reinforcement</b> <b>Learning</b> (RL), a novel method that employs only outcome supervision to achieve the benefits of process supervision for large language models. The core challenge in applying RL to complex <b>reasoning</b> is to identify a sequence of actions that result in positive rewards and provide appropriate supervision for optimization. Outcome supervision provides sparse rewards for final results without identifying error locations, whereas process supervision offers step-wise rewards but requires extensive manual annotation. R$^3$ overcomes these limitations by learning from correct demonstrations. Specifically, R$^3$ progressively slides the start state of <b>reasoning</b> from a demonstration's end to its beginning, facilitating easier model exploration at all stages. Thus, R$^3$ establishes a step-wise curriculum, allowing outcome supervision to offer step-level signals and precisely pinpoint errors. Using Llama2-7B, our method surpasses RL baseline on eight <b>reasoning</b> tasks by $4.1$ points on average. Notebaly, in program-based <b>reasoning</b> on GSM8K, it exceeds the baseline by $4.2$ points across three backbone models, and without any extra data, Codellama-7B + R$^3$ performs comparable to larger models or closed-source models.

**ABSTRACT**  
Knowledge Graphs (KGs) play a pivotal role in advancing various AI applications, with the semantic web community's exploration into multi-modal dimensions unlocking new avenues for innovation. In this survey, we carefully review over 300 articles, focusing on KG-aware research in two principal aspects: KG-driven Multi-Modal (KG4MM) learning, where KGs support multi-modal tasks, and Multi-Modal Knowledge Graph (MM4KG), which extends KG studies into the MMKG realm. We begin by defining KGs and MMKGs, then explore their construction progress. Our review includes two primary task categories: KG-aware multi-modal learning tasks, such as Image Classification and Visual Question Answering, and intrinsic MMKG tasks like Multi-modal Knowledge Graph Completion and Entity Alignment, highlighting specific research trajectories. For most of these tasks, we provide definitions, evaluation benchmarks, and additionally outline essential insights for conducting relevant research. Finally, we discuss current challenges and identify emerging trends, such as progress in Large Language Modeling and Multi-modal Pre-training strategies. This survey aims to serve as a comprehensive reference for researchers already involved in or considering delving into KG and multi-modal learning research, offering insights into the evolving landscape of MMKG research and supporting future work.

**ABSTRACT**  
There is increasing focus on adapting predictive models into agent-like systems, most notably AI assistants based on language models. We outline two structural reasons for why these models can fail when turned into agents. First, we discuss auto-suggestive delusions. Prior work has shown theoretically that models fail to imitate agents that generated the training data if the agents relied on hidden observations: the hidden observations act as confounding variables, and the models treat actions they generate as evidence for nonexistent observations. Second, we introduce and formally study a related, novel limitation: predictor-policy incoherence. When a model generates a sequence of actions, the model's implicit prediction of the policy that generated those actions can serve as a confounding variable. The result is that models choose actions as if they expect future actions to be suboptimal, causing them to be overly conservative. We show that both of those failures are fixed by including a feedback loop from the environment, that is, re-training the models on their own actions. We give simple demonstrations of both limitations using Decision Transformers and confirm that empirical results agree with our conceptual and formal analysis. Our treatment provides a unifying view of those failure modes, and informs the question of why <b>fine-tuning</b> offline learned policies with online learning makes them more effective.

**ABSTRACT**  
Utilitarian games such as dictator games to measure <b>fairness</b> have been studied in the social sciences for decades. These games have given us insight into not only how humans view <b>fairness</b> but also in what conditions the frequency of fairness, altruism and greed increase or decrease. While these games have traditionally been focused on humans, the rise of AI gives us the ability to study how these models play these games. AI is becoming a constant in human interaction and examining how these models portray <b>fairness</b> in game play can give us some insight into how AI makes decisions. Over 101 rounds of the dictator game, I conclude that AI has a strong sense of <b>fairness</b> that is dependant of it it deems the person it is playing with as trustworthy, framing has a strong effect on how much AI gives a recipient when designated the trustee, and there may be evidence that AI experiences inequality aversion just as humans.

**ABSTRACT**  
The development of artificial intelligence systems is transitioning from creating static, task-specific models to dynamic, agent-based systems capable of performing well in a wide range of applications. We propose an Interactive Agent <b>Foundation</b> <b>Model</b> that uses a novel multi-task agent training paradigm for training AI agents across a wide range of domains, datasets, and tasks. Our training paradigm unifies diverse pre-training strategies, including visual masked auto-encoders, language modeling, and next-action prediction, enabling a versatile and adaptable AI framework. We demonstrate the performance of our framework across three separate domains -- Robotics, Gaming AI, and Healthcare. Our model demonstrates its ability to generate meaningful and contextually relevant outputs in each area. The strength of our approach lies in its generality, leveraging a variety of data sources such as robotics sequences, gameplay data, large-scale video datasets, and textual information for effective multimodal and multi-task learning. Our approach provides a promising avenue for developing generalist, action-taking, multimodal systems.

**ABSTRACT**  
When humans and autonomous systems operate together as what we refer to as a hybrid team, we of course wish to ensure the team operates successfully and effectively. We refer to team members as agents. In our proposed framework, we address the case of hybrid teams in which, at any time, only one team member (the control agent) is authorized to act as control for the team. To determine the best selection of a control agent, we propose the addition of an AI manager (via Reinforcement Learning) which learns as an outside observer of the team. The manager learns a model of behavior linking observations of agent performance and the environment/world the team is operating in, and from these observations makes the most desirable selection of a control agent. We restrict the manager task by introducing a set of constraints. The manager constraints indicate acceptable team operation, so a violation occurs if the team enters a condition which is unacceptable and requires manager intervention. To ensure minimal added complexity or potential inefficiency for the team, the manager should attempt to minimize the number of times the team reaches a constraint violation and requires subsequent manager intervention. Therefore our manager is optimizing its selection of authorized agents to boost overall team performance while minimizing the frequency of manager intervention. We demonstrate our manager performance in a simulated driving scenario representing the case of a hybrid team of agents composed of a human driver and autonomous driving system. We perform experiments for our driving scenario with interfering vehicles, indicating the need for collision avoidance and proper speed control. Our results indicate a positive impact of our manager, with some cases resulting in increased team performance up to ~187% that of the best solo agent performance.

**ABSTRACT**  
Humans and other animals aptly exhibit general intelligence behaviors in solving a variety of tasks with flexibility and ability to adapt to novel situations by reusing and applying high level knowledge acquired over time. But artificial agents are more of a specialist, lacking such generalist behaviors. Artificial agents will require understanding and exploiting critical structured knowledge representations. We present a metacognitive generalization framework, Knowledge-Interaction-eXecution (KIX), and argue that interactions with objects leveraging type space facilitate the learning of transferable interaction concepts and generalization. It is a natural way of integrating knowledge into <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning</b> and promising to act as an enabler for autonomous and generalist behaviors in artificial intelligence systems.

**ABSTRACT**  
Despite significant investment into safety training, large language models (LLMs) deployed in the real world still suffer from numerous vulnerabilities. One perspective on <b>LLM</b> safety training is that it algorithmically forbids the model from answering toxic or harmful queries. To assess the effectiveness of safety training, in this work, we study forbidden tasks, i.e., tasks the model is designed to refuse to answer. Specifically, we investigate whether <b>in-context</b> <b>learning</b> (ICL) can be used to re-learn forbidden tasks despite the explicit <b>fine-tuning</b> of the model to refuse them. We first examine a toy example of refusing sentiment classification to demonstrate the problem. Then, we use <b>ICL</b> on a model fine-tuned to refuse to summarise made-up news articles. Finally, we investigate whether <b>ICL</b> can undo safety training, which could represent a major security risk. For the safety task, we look at Vicuna-7B, Starling-7B, and Llama2-7B. We show that the attack works out-of-the-box on Starling-7B and Vicuna-7B but fails on Llama2-7B. Finally, we propose an <b>ICL</b> attack that uses the chat template tokens like a <b>prompt</b> injection attack to achieve a better attack success rate on Vicuna-7B and Starling-7B. Trigger Warning: the appendix contains LLM-generated text with violence, suicide, and misinformation.

**ABSTRACT**  
Graph neural networks (GNNs) are the dominant paradigm for classifying nodes in a graph, but they have several undesirable attributes <b>stemming</b> from their message passing architecture. Recently, <b>distillation</b> methods succeeded in eliminating the use of GNNs at test time but they still require them during training. We perform a careful analysis of the role that GNNs play in <b>distillation</b> methods. This analysis leads us to propose a fully GNN-free approach for node classification, not requiring them at train or test time. Our method consists of three key components: smoothness constraints, pseudo-labeling iterations and neighborhood-label histograms. Our final approach can match the state-of-the-art accuracy on standard popular benchmarks such as citation and co-purchase networks, without training a GNN.

**ABSTRACT**  
We analyze the capabilities of <b>Transformer</b> language models on learning discrete algorithms. To this end, we introduce two new tasks demanding the composition of several discrete sub-tasks. On both training <b>LLaMA</b> models from scratch and prompting on <b>GPT-4</b> and Gemini we measure learning compositions of learned primitives. We observe that the compositional capabilities of state-of-the-art <b>Transformer</b> language models are very limited and sample-wise scale worse than relearning all sub-tasks for a new algorithmic composition. We also present a theorem in complexity theory, showing that gradient descent on memorizing feedforward models can be exponentially data inefficient.

**ABSTRACT**  
We show that offline actor-critic <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning</b> can scale to large models - such as transformers - and follows similar scaling laws as <b>supervised</b> learning. We find that offline actor-critic algorithms can outperform strong, supervised, behavioral cloning baselines for multi-task training on a large dataset containing both sub-optimal and expert behavior on 132 continuous control tasks. We introduce a Perceiver-based actor-critic model and elucidate the key model features needed to make offline RL work with self- and cross-attention modules. Overall, we find that: i) simple offline actor critic algorithms are a natural choice for gradually moving away from the currently predominant paradigm of behavioral cloning, and ii) via offline RL it is possible to learn multi-task policies that master many domains simultaneously, including real robotics tasks, from sub-optimal demonstrations or self-generated data.

**ABSTRACT**  
The LoRA-finetuning <b>quantization</b> of LLMs has been extensively studied to obtain accurate yet compact LLMs for deployment on resource-constrained hardware. However, existing methods cause the quantized <b>LLM</b> to severely degrade and even fail to benefit from the finetuning of LoRA. This paper proposes a novel IR-QLoRA for pushing quantized LLMs with LoRA to be highly accurate through information retention. The proposed IR-QLoRA mainly relies on two technologies derived from the perspective of unified information: (1) statistics-based Information Calibration <b>Quantization</b> allows the quantized parameters of <b>LLM</b> to retain original information accurately; (2) finetuning-based Information Elastic Connection makes LoRA utilizes elastic representation transformation with diverse information. Comprehensive experiments show that IR-QLoRA can significantly improve accuracy across <b>LLaMA</b> and LLaMA2 families under 2-4 bit-widths, e.g., 4- bit LLaMA-7B achieves 1.4% improvement on MMLU compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The significant performance gain requires only a tiny 0.31% additional time consumption, revealing the satisfactory efficiency of our IRQLoRA. We highlight that IR-QLoRA enjoys excellent versatility, compatible with various frameworks (e.g., NormalFloat and Integer quantization) and brings general accuracy gains. The code is available at https://github.com/htqin/ir-qlora.

**ABSTRACT**  
The confluence of Federated Learning (FL) and Large Language Models (LLMs) is ushering in a new era in privacy-preserving natural language processing. However, the intensive memory requirements for <b>fine-tuning</b> LLMs pose significant challenges, especially when deploying on edge devices with limited computational resources. To circumvent this, we explore the novel integration of Memory-efficient Zeroth-Order Optimization within a federated setting, a synergy we denote as FedMeZO. Our study is the first to examine the theoretical underpinnings of FedMeZO in the context of LLMs, tackling key questions regarding the influence of large parameter spaces on optimization behavior, the establishment of convergence properties, and the identification of critical parameters for convergence to inform personalized federated strategies. Our extensive empirical evidence supports the theory, showing that FedMeZO not only converges faster than traditional first-order methods such as <b>SGD</b> but also significantly reduces GPU memory usage during training to levels comparable to those during inference. Moreover, the proposed personalized FL strategy that is built upon the theoretical insights to customize the client-wise learning rate can effectively accelerate loss reduction. We hope our work can help to bridge theoretical and practical aspects of federated <b>fine-tuning</b> for LLMs and facilitate further development and research.

**ABSTRACT**  
How can we best encode structured data into sequential form for use in large language models (LLMs)? In this work, we introduce a parameter-efficient method to explicitly represent structured data for LLMs. Our method, GraphToken, learns an encoding function to extend prompts with explicit structured information. Unlike other work which focuses on limited domains (e.g. knowledge graph representation), our work is the first effort focused on the general encoding of structured data to be used for various <b>reasoning</b> tasks. We show that explicitly representing the graph structure allows significant improvements to graph <b>reasoning</b> tasks. Specifically, we see across the board improvements - up to 73% points - on node, edge and, graph-level tasks from the GraphQA benchmark.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Unsupervised</b> Graph <b>Domain</b> <b>Adaptation</b> (UGDA) aims to transfer knowledge from a labelled source graph to an unlabelled target graph in order to address the distribution shifts between graph domains. Previous works have primarily focused on aligning data from the source and target graph in the representation space learned by graph neural networks (GNNs). However, the inherent generalization capability of GNNs has been largely overlooked. Motivated by our empirical analysis, we reevaluate the role of GNNs in graph <b>domain</b> <b>adaptation</b> and uncover the pivotal role of the propagation process in GNNs for adapting to different graph domains. We provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis of UGDA and derive a generalization bound for multi-layer GNNs. By formulating <b>GNN</b> Lipschitz for k-layer GNNs, we show that the target risk bound can be tighter by removing propagation layers in source graph and stacking multiple propagation layers in target graph. Based on the empirical and theoretical analysis mentioned above, we propose a simple yet effective approach called A2GNN for graph domain adaptation. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed A2GNN framework.

**ABSTRACT**  
Social networks are vital for information sharing, especially in the health sector for discussing diseases and treatments. These platforms, however, often feature posts as brief texts, posing challenges for Artificial Intelligence (AI) in understanding context. We introduce a novel hybrid approach combining community-maintained knowledge graphs (like Wikidata) with deep learning to enhance the categorization of social media posts. This method uses advanced entity recognizers and linkers (like <b>Falcon</b> 2.0) to connect short post entities to knowledge graphs. Knowledge graph embeddings (KGEs) and contextualized word embeddings (like BERT) are then employed to create rich, context-based representations of these posts. Our focus is on the health domain, particularly in identifying posts related to eating disorders (e.g., anorexia, bulimia) to aid healthcare providers in early diagnosis. We tested our approach on a dataset of 2,000 tweets about eating disorders, finding that merging word embeddings with knowledge graph information enhances the predictive models' reliability. This methodology aims to assist health experts in spotting patterns indicative of mental disorders, thereby improving early detection and accurate diagnosis for personalized medicine.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recently, there has been a widespread proliferation of "expert" language models that are specialized to a specific task or domain through parameter-efficient fine-tuning. How can we recycle large collections of expert language models to improve <b>zero-shot</b> generalization to unseen tasks? In this work, we propose Post-Hoc Adaptive Tokenwise Gating Over an Ocean of Specialized Experts (PHATGOOSE), which learns to route among specialized modules that were produced through parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Unlike past methods that learn to route among specialized models, PHATGOOSE explores the possibility that <b>zero-shot</b> generalization will be improved if different experts can be adaptively chosen for each token and at each layer in the model. Crucially, our method is post-hoc - it does not require simultaneous access to the datasets used to create the specialized models and only requires a modest amount of additional compute after each expert model is trained. In experiments covering a range of specialized model collections and <b>zero-shot</b> generalization benchmarks, we find that PHATGOOSE outperforms past methods for post-hoc routing and, in some cases, outperforms explicit multitask training (which requires simultaneous data access). To better understand the routing strategy learned by PHATGOOSE, we perform qualitative experiments to validate that PHATGOOSE's performance stems from its ability to make adaptive per-token and per-module expert choices. We release all of our code to support future work on improving <b>zero-shot</b> generalization by recycling specialized experts.

**ABSTRACT**  
Time series analysis is vital for numerous applications, and transformers have become increasingly prominent in this domain. Leading methods customize the <b>transformer</b> architecture from NLP and CV, utilizing a patching technique to convert continuous signals into segments. Yet, time series data are uniquely challenging due to significant distribution shifts and intrinsic noise levels. To address these two challenges,we introduce the Sparse Vector Quantized FFN-Free <b>Transformer</b> (Sparse-VQ). Our methodology capitalizes on a sparse vector <b>quantization</b> technique coupled with Reverse Instance Normalization (RevIN) to reduce noise impact and capture sufficient statistics for forecasting, serving as an alternative to the Feed-Forward layer (FFN) in the <b>transformer</b> architecture. Our FFN-free approach trims the parameter count, enhancing computational efficiency and reducing overfitting. Through evaluations across ten benchmark datasets, including the newly introduced CAISO dataset, Sparse-VQ surpasses leading models with a 7.84% and 4.17% decrease in MAE for univariate and multivariate time series forecasting, respectively. Moreover, it can be seamlessly integrated with existing transformer-based models to elevate their performance.

**ABSTRACT**  
Self-attention, the core mechanism of transformers, distinguishes them from traditional neural networks and drives their outstanding performance. Towards developing the fundamental optimization principles of self-attention, we investigate the implicit bias of gradient descent (GD) in training a <b>self-attention</b> layer with fixed linear decoder in binary classification. Drawing inspiration from the study of GD in linear <b>logistic</b> <b>regression</b> over separable data, recent work demonstrates that as the number of iterations $t$ approaches infinity, the key-query matrix $W_t$ converges locally (with respect to the initialization direction) to a hard-margin SVM solution $W_{mm}$. Our work enhances this result in four aspects. Firstly, we identify non-trivial data settings for which convergence is provably global, thus shedding light on the optimization landscape. Secondly, we provide the first finite-time convergence rate for $W_t$ to $W_{mm}$, along with quantifying the rate of sparsification in the attention map. Thirdly, through an analysis of normalized GD and Polyak step-size, we demonstrate analytically that adaptive step-size rules can accelerate the convergence of self-attention. Additionally, we remove the restriction of prior work on a fixed linear decoder. Our results reinforce the implicit-bias perspective of <b>self-attention</b> and strengthen its connections to implicit-bias in linear logistic regression, despite the intricate non-convex nature of the former.

**ABSTRACT**  
We consider the infinite-horizon, average-reward restless <b>bandit</b> problem in discrete time. We propose a new class of policies that are designed to drive a progressively larger subset of arms toward the optimal distribution. We show that our policies are asymptotically optimal with an $O(1/\sqrt{N})$ optimality gap for an $N$-armed problem, provided that the single-armed relaxed problem is unichain and aperiodic. Our approach departs from most existing work that focuses on index or priority policies, which rely on the Uniform Global Attractor Property (UGAP) to guarantee convergence to the optimum, or a recently developed simulation-based policy, which requires a Synchronization Assumption (SA).

**ABSTRACT**  
Large <b>transformer</b> models have demonstrated remarkable success. Post-training <b>quantization</b> (PTQ), which requires only a small dataset for calibration and avoids end-to-end retraining, is a promising solution for compressing these large models. Regrettably, existing PTQ methods typically exhibit non-trivial performance loss. We find that the performance bottleneck stems from over-consideration of hardware compatibility in the <b>quantization</b> process, compelling them to reluctantly employ simple quantizers, albeit at the expense of accuracy. With the above insights, we propose RepQuant, a novel PTQ framework with quantization-inference decoupling paradigm to address the above issues. RepQuant employs complex quantizers in the <b>quantization</b> process and simplified quantizers in the inference process, and performs mathematically equivalent transformations between the two through <b>quantization</b> scale reparameterization, thus ensuring both accurate <b>quantization</b> and efficient inference. More specifically, we focus on two components with extreme distributions: LayerNorm activations and Softmax activations. Initially, we apply channel-wise <b>quantization</b> and log$\sqrt{2}$ quantization, respectively, which are tailored to their distributions. In particular, for the former, we introduce a learnable per-channel dual clipping scheme, which is designed to efficiently identify outliers in the unbalanced activations with fine granularity. Then, we reparameterize the scales to hardware-friendly layer-wise <b>quantization</b> and log2 <b>quantization</b> for inference. Moreover, quantized weight reconstruction is seamlessly integrated into the above procedure to further push the performance limits. Extensive experiments are performed on different large-scale <b>transformer</b> variants on multiple tasks, including vision, language, and multi-modal transformers, and RepQuant encouragingly demonstrates significant performance advantages.

**ABSTRACT**  
In human cognition, the binding problem describes the open question of how the brain flexibly integrates diverse information into cohesive object representations. Analogously, in machine learning, there is a pursuit for models capable of strong generalization and <b>reasoning</b> by learning object-centric representations in an <b>unsupervised</b> manner. Drawing from neuroscientific theories, Rotating Features learn such representations by introducing vector-valued features that encapsulate object characteristics in their magnitudes and object affiliation in their orientations. The "$\chi$-binding" mechanism, embedded in every layer of the architecture, has been shown to be crucial, but remains poorly understood. In this paper, we propose an alternative "cosine binding" mechanism, which explicitly computes the alignment between features and adjusts weights accordingly, and we show that it achieves equivalent performance. This allows us to draw direct connections to <b>self-attention</b> and biological neural processes, and to shed light on the fundamental dynamics for object-centric representations to emerge in Rotating Features.

**ABSTRACT**  
Hypergraphs, with hyperedges connecting more than two nodes, are key for modelling higher-order interactions in real-world data. The success of graph neural networks (GNNs) reveals the capability of neural networks to process data with pairwise interactions. This inspires the usage of neural networks for data with higher-order interactions, thereby leading to the development of hypergraph neural networks (HyperGNNs). GNNs and HyperGNNs are typically considered distinct since they are designed for data on different geometric topologies. However, in this paper, we theoretically demonstrate that, in the context of node classification, most HyperGNNs can be approximated using a <b>GNN</b> with a weighted clique expansion of the hypergraph. This leads to WCE-GNN, a simple and efficient framework comprising a <b>GNN</b> and a weighted clique expansion (WCE), for hypergraph node classification. Experiments on nine real-world hypergraph <b>node</b> <b>classification</b> benchmarks showcase that WCE-GNN demonstrates not only higher classification accuracy compared to state-of-the-art HyperGNNs, but also superior memory and runtime efficiency.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recent advancements in federated learning (FL) have produced models that retain user privacy by training across multiple decentralized devices or systems holding local data samples. However, these strategies often neglect the inherent challenges of statistical heterogeneity and vulnerability to adversarial attacks, which can degrade model robustness and fairness. Personalized FL strategies offer some respite by adjusting models to fit individual client profiles, yet they tend to neglect server-side aggregation vulnerabilities. To address these issues, we propose Reinforcement Federated Learning (RFL), a novel framework that leverages deep <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning</b> to adaptively optimize client contribution during aggregation, thereby enhancing both model robustness against malicious clients and <b>fairness</b> across participants under non-identically distributed settings. To achieve this goal, we propose a meticulous approach involving a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient-based algorithm for continuous control of aggregation weights, an innovative client selection method based on model parameter distances, and a reward mechanism guided by validation set performance. Empirically, extensive experiments demonstrate that, in terms of robustness, RFL outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining comparable levels of fairness, offering a promising solution to build resilient and fair federated systems.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recently, Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in various high-impact applications, including fraud detection and content recommendation. Despite the success of TGNNs, they are prone to the prevalent noise found in real-world dynamic graphs like time-deprecated links and skewed interaction distribution. The noise causes two critical issues that significantly compromise the accuracy of TGNNs: (1) models are <b>supervised</b> by inferior interactions, and (2) noisy input induces high variance in the aggregated messages. However, current TGNN denoising techniques do not consider the diverse and dynamic noise pattern of each node. In addition, they also suffer from the excessive mini-batch generation overheads caused by traversing more neighbors. We believe the remedy for fast and accurate TGNNs lies in temporal adaptive sampling. In this work, we propose TASER, the first adaptive sampling method for TGNNs optimized for accuracy, efficiency, and scalability. TASER adapts its mini-batch selection based on training dynamics and temporal neighbor selection based on the contextual, structural, and temporal properties of past interactions. To alleviate the bottleneck in mini-batch generation, TASER implements a pure GPU-based temporal neighbor finder and a dedicated GPU feature cache. We evaluate the performance of TASER using two state-of-the-art backbone TGNNs. On five popular datasets, TASER outperforms the corresponding baselines by an average of 2.3% in Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) while achieving an average of 5.1x speedup in training time.

**ABSTRACT**  
User intentions are typically formalized as evaluation rewards to be maximized when <b>fine-tuning</b> language models (LMs). Existing alignment methods, such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), are mainly tailored for pairwise preference data where rewards are implicitly defined rather than explicitly given. In this paper, we introduce a general framework for LM alignment, leveraging Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) to bridge the gap in handling reward datasets explicitly annotated with scalar evaluations. Our framework comprises two parallel algorithms, NCA and InfoNCA, both enabling the direct extraction of an LM policy from reward data as well as preference data. Notably, we show that the DPO loss is a special case of our proposed InfoNCA objective under pairwise preference settings, thereby integrating and extending current alignment theories. By contrasting NCA and InfoNCA, we show that InfoNCA and DPO adjust relative likelihood across different responses to a single instruction, while NCA optimizes absolute likelihood for each response. We apply our methods to align a 7B language model with a <b>GPT-4</b> annotated reward dataset. Experimental results suggest that InfoNCA surpasses the DPO baseline in <b>GPT-4</b> evaluations, while NCA enjoys better training stability with competitive performance.

**ABSTRACT**  
The over-parameterized pre-trained models pose a great challenge to <b>fine-tuning</b> with limited computation resources. An intuitive solution is to prune the less informative samples from the <b>fine-tuning</b> dataset. A series of training-based scoring functions are proposed to quantify the informativeness of the data subset but the <b>pruning</b> cost becomes non-negligible due to the heavy parameter updating. For efficient pruning, it is viable to adapt the similarity scoring function of geometric-based methods from training-based to training-free. However, we empirically show that such adaption distorts the original <b>pruning</b> and results in inferior performance on the downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose to treat the learning complexity (LC) as the scoring function for classification and regression tasks. Specifically, the learning complexity is defined as the average predicted confidence of subnets with different capacities, which encapsulates data processing within a converged model. Then we preserve the diverse and easy samples for fine-tuning. Extensive experiments with vision datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed scoring function for classification tasks. For the instruction <b>fine-tuning</b> of large language models, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with stable convergence, outperforming the full training with only 10\% of the instruction dataset.

**ABSTRACT**  
The need to identify graphs having small structural distance from a query arises in biology, chemistry, recommender systems, and social network analysis. Among several methods to measure inter graph distance, Graph Edit Distance (GED) is preferred for its comprehensibility, yet hindered by the NP-hardness of its computation. State-of-the-art GED approximations predominantly employ neural methods, which, however, (i) lack an explanatory edit path corresponding to the approximated GED; (ii) require the NP-hard generation of ground-truth GEDs for training; and (iii) necessitate separate training on each dataset. In this paper, we propose an efficient algebraic unsuper vised method, EUGENE, that approximates GED and yields edit paths corresponding to the approx imated cost, while eliminating the need for ground truth generation and data-specific training. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that the aforementioned benefits of EUGENE do not come at the cost of efficacy. Specifically, EUGENE consistently ranks among the most accurate methods across all of the benchmark datasets and outperforms majority of the neural approaches.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Offline</b> <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning</b> (RL), which seeks to learn an optimal policy using offline data, has garnered significant interest due to its potential in critical applications where online data collection is infeasible or expensive. This work explores the benefit of federated learning for offline RL, aiming at collaboratively leveraging offline datasets at multiple agents. Focusing on finite-horizon episodic tabular Markov decision processes (MDPs), we design FedLCB-Q, a variant of the popular model-free Q-learning algorithm tailored for federated offline RL. FedLCB-Q updates local Q-functions at agents with novel learning rate schedules and aggregates them at a central server using importance averaging and a carefully designed pessimistic penalty term. Our sample complexity analysis reveals that, with appropriately chosen parameters and synchronization schedules, FedLCB-Q achieves linear speedup in terms of the number of agents without requiring high-quality datasets at individual agents, as long as the local datasets collectively cover the state-action space visited by the optimal policy, highlighting the power of collaboration in the federated setting. In fact, the sample complexity almost matches that of the single-agent counterpart, as if all the data are stored at a central location, up to polynomial factors of the horizon length. Furthermore, FedLCB-Q is communication-efficient, where the number of communication rounds is only linear with respect to the horizon length up to logarithmic factors.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recent advancements in meta-learning have enabled the automatic discovery of novel <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning</b> algorithms parameterized by surrogate objective functions. To improve upon manually designed algorithms, the parameterization of this learned objective function must be expressive enough to represent novel principles of learning (instead of merely recovering already established ones) while still generalizing to a wide range of settings outside of its meta-training distribution. However, existing methods focus on discovering objective functions that, like many widely used objective functions in reinforcement learning, do not take into account the total number of steps allowed for training, or "training horizon". In contrast, humans use a plethora of different learning objectives across the course of acquiring a new ability. For instance, students may alter their studying techniques based on the proximity to exam deadlines and their self-assessed capabilities. This paper contends that ignoring the optimization time horizon significantly restricts the expressive potential of discovered learning algorithms. We propose a simple augmentation to two existing objective discovery approaches that allows the discovered algorithm to dynamically update its objective function throughout the agent's training procedure, resulting in expressive schedules and increased generalization across different training horizons. In the process, we find that commonly used meta-gradient approaches fail to discover such adaptive objective functions while evolution strategies discover highly dynamic learning rules. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a wide range of tasks and analyze the resulting learned algorithms, which we find effectively balance exploration and exploitation by modifying the structure of their learning rules throughout the agent's lifetime.

**ABSTRACT**  
Accurate solar power forecasting is crucial to integrate photovoltaic plants into the electric grid, schedule and secure the power grid safety. This problem becomes more demanding for those newly installed solar plants which lack sufficient data. Current research predominantly relies on historical solar power data or numerical weather prediction in a single-modality format, ignoring the complementary information provided in different modalities. In this paper, we propose a multi-modality fusion framework to integrate historical power data, numerical weather prediction, and satellite images, significantly improving forecast performance. We introduce a vector quantized framework that aligns modalities with varying information densities, striking a balance between integrating sufficient information and averting model overfitting. Our framework demonstrates strong <b>zero-shot</b> forecasting capability, which is especially useful for those newly installed plants. Moreover, we collect and release a multi-modal solar power (MMSP) dataset from real-world plants to further promote the research of multi-modal solar forecasting algorithms. Our extensive experiments show that our model not only operates with robustness but also boosts accuracy in both <b>zero-shot</b> forecasting and scenarios rich with training data, surpassing leading models. We have incorporated it into our eForecaster platform and deployed it for more than 300 solar plants with a capacity of over 15GW.

**ABSTRACT**  
Longitudinal data are important in numerous fields, such as healthcare, sociology and seismology, but real-world datasets present notable challenges for practitioners because they can be high-dimensional, contain structured missingness patterns, and measurement time points can be governed by an unknown stochastic process. While various solutions have been suggested, the majority of them have been designed to account for only one of these challenges. In this work, we propose a flexible and efficient latent-variable model that is capable of addressing all these limitations. Our approach utilizes Gaussian processes to capture temporal correlations between samples and their associated missingness masks as well as to model the underlying point process. We construct our model as a <b>variational</b> <b>autoencoder</b> together with deep neural network parameterised encoder and decoder models, and develop a scalable amortised variational inference approach for efficient model training. We demonstrate competitive performance using both simulated and real datasets.

**ABSTRACT**  
We study the sample complexity of <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning</b> (RL) in Mean-Field Games (MFGs) with model-based function approximation that requires strategic exploration to find a Nash Equilibrium policy. We introduce the Partial Model-Based Eluder Dimension (P-MBED), a more effective notion to characterize the model class complexity. Notably, P-MBED measures the complexity of the single-agent model class converted from the given mean-field model class, and potentially, can be exponentially lower than the MBED proposed by \citet{huang2023statistical}. We contribute a model elimination algorithm featuring a novel exploration strategy and establish sample complexity results polynomial w.r.t.~P-MBED. Crucially, our results reveal that, under the basic realizability and Lipschitz continuity assumptions, \emph{learning Nash Equilibrium in MFGs is no more statistically challenging than solving a logarithmic number of single-agent RL problems}. We further extend our results to Multi-Type MFGs, generalizing from conventional MFGs and involving multiple types of agents. This extension implies statistical tractability of a broader class of Markov Games through the efficacy of mean-field approximation. Finally, inspired by our theoretical algorithm, we present a <b>heuristic</b> <b>approach</b> with improved computational efficiency and empirically demonstrate its effectiveness.

**ABSTRACT**  
Motivated by the success of Transformers when applied to sequences of discrete symbols, token-based world models (TBWMs) were recently proposed as sample-efficient methods. In TBWMs, the world model consumes agent experience as a language-like sequence of tokens, where each observation constitutes a sub-sequence. However, during imagination, the sequential token-by-token generation of next observations results in a severe bottleneck, leading to long training times, poor GPU utilization, and limited representations. To resolve this bottleneck, we devise a novel Parallel Observation Prediction (POP) mechanism. POP augments a Retentive Network (RetNet) with a novel forward mode tailored to our <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning</b> setting. We incorporate POP in a novel TBWM agent named REM (Retentive Environment Model), showcasing a 15.4x faster imagination compared to prior TBWMs. REM attains superhuman performance on 12 out of 26 games of the Atari 100K benchmark, while training in less than 12 hours. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/leor-c/REM}.

**ABSTRACT**  
Existing approaches to <b>fairness</b> in stochastic multi-armed bandits (MAB) primarily focus on exposure guarantee to individual arms. When arms are naturally grouped by certain attribute(s), we propose Bi-Level Fairness, which considers two levels of fairness. At the first level, Bi-Level <b>Fairness</b> guarantees a certain minimum exposure to each group. To address the unbalanced allocation of pulls to individual arms within a group, we consider meritocratic <b>fairness</b> at the second level, which ensures that each arm is pulled according to its merit within the group. Our work shows that we can adapt a UCB-based algorithm to achieve a Bi-Level <b>Fairness</b> by providing (i) anytime Group Exposure <b>Fairness</b> guarantees and (ii) ensuring individual-level Meritocratic <b>Fairness</b> within each group. We first show that one can decompose regret bounds into two components: (a) regret due to anytime group exposure <b>fairness</b> and (b) regret due to meritocratic <b>fairness</b> within each group. Our proposed algorithm BF-UCB balances these two regrets optimally to achieve the upper bound of $O(\sqrt{T})$ on regret; $T$ being the stopping time. With the help of simulated experiments, we further show that BF-UCB achieves sub-linear regret; provides better group and individual exposure guarantees compared to existing algorithms; and does not result in a significant drop in reward with respect to UCB algorithm, which does not impose any <b>fairness</b> constraint.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this work, we examine a network of agents operating asynchronously, aiming to discover an ideal global model that suits individual local datasets. Our assumption is that each agent independently chooses when to participate throughout the algorithm and the specific subset of its neighbourhood with which it will cooperate at any given moment. When an agent chooses to take part, it undergoes multiple local updates before conveying its outcomes to the sub-sampled neighbourhood. Under this setup, we prove that the resulting asynchronous diffusion strategy is stable in the mean-square error sense and provide performance guarantees specifically for the federated learning setting. We illustrate the findings with numerical simulations.

**ABSTRACT**  
We address <b>offline</b> <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning</b> with privacy guarantees, where the goal is to train a policy that is differentially private with respect to individual trajectories in the dataset. To achieve this, we introduce DP-MORL, an MBRL algorithm coming with differential privacy guarantees. A private model of the environment is first learned from offline data using DP-FedAvg, a training method for neural networks that provides differential privacy guarantees at the trajectory level. Then, we use model-based policy optimization to derive a policy from the (penalized) private model, without any further interaction with the system or access to the input data. We empirically show that DP-MORL enables the training of private RL agents from offline data and we furthermore outline the price of privacy in this setting.

**ABSTRACT**  
Diagrams matter. Unfortunately, the deep learning community has no standard method for diagramming architectures. The current combination of linear algebra notation and ad-hoc diagrams fails to offer the necessary precision to understand architectures in all their detail. However, this detail is critical for faithful implementation, mathematical analysis, further innovation, and ethical assurances. I present neural circuit diagrams, a graphical language tailored to the needs of communicating deep learning architectures. Neural circuit diagrams naturally keep track of the changing arrangement of data, precisely show how operations are broadcast over axes, and display the critical parallel behavior of linear operations. A lingering issue with existing diagramming methods is the inability to simultaneously express the detail of axes and the free arrangement of data, which neural circuit diagrams solve. Their compositional structure is analogous to code, creating a close correspondence between diagrams and implementation. In this work, I introduce neural circuit diagrams for an audience of machine learning researchers. After introducing neural circuit diagrams, I cover a host of architectures to show their utility and breed familiarity. This includes the <b>transformer</b> architecture, <b>convolution</b> (and its difficult-to-explain extensions), residual networks, the U-Net, and the vision transformer. I include a Jupyter notebook that provides evidence for the close correspondence between diagrams and code. Finally, I examine backpropagation using neural circuit diagrams. I show their utility in providing mathematical insight and analyzing algorithms' time and space complexities.

**ABSTRACT**  
Given the generational gap in available hardware between lay practitioners and the most endowed institutions, LLMs are becoming increasingly inaccessible as they grow in size. Whilst many approaches have been proposed to compress LLMs to make their resource consumption manageable, these methods themselves tend to be resource intensive, putting them out of the reach of the very user groups they target. In this work, we explore the problem of structured <b>pruning</b> of LLMs using only forward passes. We seek to empower practitioners to prune models so large that their available hardware has just enough memory to run inference. We develop Bonsai, a gradient-free, perturbative <b>pruning</b> method capable of delivering small, fast, and accurate pruned models. We observe that Bonsai outputs pruned models that (i) outperform those generated by more expensive gradient-based structured <b>pruning</b> methods, and (ii) are twice as fast (with comparable accuracy) as those generated by semi-structured <b>pruning</b> methods requiring comparable resources as Bonsai. We also leverage Bonsai to produce a new sub-2B model using a single A6000 that yields state-of-the-art performance on 4/6 tasks on the Huggingface Open <b>LLM</b> leaderboard.

**ABSTRACT**  
Classical multi-agent <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning</b> (MARL) assumes risk neutrality and complete objectivity for agents. However, in settings where agents need to consider or model human economic or social preferences, a notion of risk must be incorporated into the RL optimization problem. This will be of greater importance in MARL where other human or non-human agents are involved, possibly with their own risk-sensitive policies. In this work, we consider risk-sensitive and non-cooperative MARL with cumulative prospect theory (CPT), a non-convex risk measure and a generalization of coherent measures of risk. CPT is capable of explaining loss aversion in humans and their tendency to overestimate/underestimate small/large probabilities. We propose a distributed sampling-based actor-critic (AC) algorithm with CPT risk for network aggregative Markov games (NAMGs), which we call Distributed Nested CPT-AC. Under a set of assumptions, we prove the convergence of the algorithm to a subjective notion of Markov perfect Nash equilibrium in NAMGs. The experimental results show that subjective CPT policies obtained by our algorithm can be different from the risk-neutral ones, and agents with a higher loss aversion are more inclined to socially isolate themselves in an NAMG.

**ABSTRACT**  
How to automatically design better machine learning programs is an open problem within AutoML. While evolution has been a popular tool to search for better ML programs, using learning itself to guide the search has been less successful and less understood on harder problems but has the promise to dramatically increase the speed and final performance of the optimization process. We propose guiding evolution with a binary discriminator, trained online to distinguish which program is better given a pair of programs. The discriminator selects better programs without having to perform a costly evaluation and thus speed up the convergence of evolution. Our method can encode a wide variety of ML components including symbolic optimizers, neural architectures, RL loss functions, and symbolic regression equations with the same directed acyclic graph representation. By combining this representation with modern GNNs and an adaptive mutation strategy, we demonstrate our method can speed up evolution across a set of diverse problems including a 3.7x speedup on the symbolic search for ML optimizers and a 4x speedup for RL loss functions.

**ABSTRACT**  
In many classification applications, the prediction of a deep neural network (DNN) based classifier needs to be accompanied with some confidence indication. Two popular post-processing approaches for that aim are: 1) calibration: modifying the classifier's softmax values such that their maximum (associated with the prediction) better estimates the correctness probability; and 2) conformal prediction (CP): devising a score (based on the softmax values) from which a set of predictions with theoretically guaranteed marginal coverage of the correct class is produced. While in practice both types of indications can be desired, so far the interplay between them has not been investigated. Toward filling this gap, in this paper we study the effect of temperature scaling, arguably the most common calibration technique, on prominent CP methods. We start with an extensive empirical study that among other insights shows that, surprisingly, calibration has a detrimental effect on popular adaptive CP methods: it frequently leads to larger prediction sets. Then, we turn to theoretically analyze this behavior. We reveal several mathematical properties of the procedure, according to which we provide a <b>reasoning</b> for the phenomenon. Our study suggests that it may be worthwhile to utilize adaptive CP methods, chosen for their enhanced conditional coverage, based on softmax values prior to (or after canceling) temperature scaling calibration.

**ABSTRACT**  
Insufficiently precise diagnosis of clinical disease is likely responsible for many treatment failures, even for common conditions and treatments. With a large enough dataset, it may be possible to use <b>unsupervised</b> machine learning to define clinical disease patterns more precisely. We present an approach to learning these patterns by using probabilistic independence to disentangle the imprint on the medical record of causal latent sources of disease. We inferred a broad set of 2000 clinical signatures of latent sources from 9195 variables in 269,099 Electronic Health Records. The learned signatures produced better discrimination than the original variables in a lung cancer prediction task unknown to the inference algorithm, predicting 3-year malignancy in patients with no history of cancer before a solitary lung nodule was discovered. More importantly, the signatures' greater explanatory power identified pre-nodule signatures of apparently undiagnosed cancer in many of those patients.

**ABSTRACT**  
In contexts where data samples represent a physically stable state, it is often assumed that the data points represent the local minima of an energy landscape. In control theory, it is well-known that energy can serve as an effective Lyapunov function. Despite this, connections between control theory and generative models in the literature are sparse, even though there are several machine learning applications with physically stable data points. In this paper, we focus on such data and a recent class of deep generative models called flow matching. We apply tools of stochastic stability for time-independent systems to flow matching models. In doing so, we characterize the space of flow matching models that are amenable to this treatment, as well as draw connections to other control theory principles. We demonstrate our theoretical results on two examples.

**ABSTRACT**  
Offline preference optimization allows <b>fine-tuning</b> large models directly from offline data, and has proved effective in recent alignment practices. We propose generalized preference optimization (GPO), a family of offline losses parameterized by a general class of convex functions. GPO enables a unified view over preference optimization, encompassing existing algorithms such as DPO, IPO and SLiC as special cases, while naturally introducing new variants. The GPO framework also sheds light on how offline algorithms enforce regularization, through the design of the convex function that defines the loss. Our analysis and experiments reveal the connections and subtle differences between the offline regularization and the KL divergence regularization intended by the canonical RLHF formulation. In all, our results present new algorithmic toolkits and empirical insights to alignment practitioners.

**ABSTRACT**  
Dataset Condensation (DC) refers to the recent class of dataset compression methods that generate a smaller, synthetic, dataset from a larger dataset. This synthetic dataset retains the essential information of the original dataset, enabling models trained on it to achieve performance levels comparable to those trained on the full dataset. Most current DC methods have mainly concerned with achieving high test performance with limited data budget, and have not directly addressed the question of adversarial robustness. In this work, we investigate the impact of adversarial robustness on models trained with compressed datasets. We show that the compressed datasets obtained from DC methods are not effective in transferring adversarial robustness to models. As a solution to improve dataset compression efficiency and adversarial robustness simultaneously, we propose a novel robustness-aware dataset compression method based on finding the Minimal Finite Covering (MFC) of the dataset. The proposed method is (1) obtained by one-time computation and is applicable for any model, (2) more effective than DC methods when applying <b>adversarial</b> <b>training</b> over MFC, (3) provably robust by minimizing the generalized adversarial loss. Additionally, empirical evaluation on three datasets shows that the proposed method is able to achieve better robustness and performance trade-off compared to DC methods such as distribution matching.

**ABSTRACT**  
The analysis of scientific data and complex multivariate systems requires information quantities that capture relationships among multiple random variables. Recently, new information-theoretic measures have been developed to overcome the shortcomings of classical ones, such as mutual information, that are restricted to considering pairwise interactions. Among them, the concept of information synergy and redundancy is crucial for understanding the high-order dependencies between variables. One of the most prominent and versatile measures based on this concept is O-information, which provides a clear and scalable way to quantify the synergy-redundancy balance in multivariate systems. However, its practical application is limited to simplified cases. In this work, we introduce S$\Omega$I, which allows for the first time to compute O-information without restrictive assumptions about the system. Our experiments validate our approach on synthetic data, and demonstrate the effectiveness of S$\Omega$I in the context of a real-world use case.

**ABSTRACT**  
Accurate real-time traffic state forecasting plays a pivotal role in traffic control research. In particular, the CIRCLES consortium project necessitates predictive techniques to mitigate the impact of data source delays. After the success of the MegaVanderTest experiment, this paper aims at overcoming the current system limitations and develop a more suited approach to improve the real-time traffic state estimation for the next iterations of the experiment. In this paper, we introduce the SA-LSTM, a deep forecasting method integrating <b>Self-Attention</b> (SA) on the spatial dimension with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) yielding state-of-the-art results in real-time mesoscale traffic forecasting. We extend this approach to multi-step forecasting with the n-step SA-LSTM, which outperforms traditional multi-step forecasting methods in the trade-off between short-term and long-term predictions, all while operating in real-time.

**ABSTRACT**  
In Federated Learning (FL), forgetting, or the loss of knowledge across rounds, hampers algorithm convergence, particularly in the presence of severe data heterogeneity among clients. This study explores the nuances of this issue, emphasizing the critical role of forgetting in FL's inefficient learning within heterogeneous data contexts. Knowledge loss occurs in both client-local updates and server-side aggregation steps; addressing one without the other fails to mitigate forgetting. We introduce a metric to measure forgetting granularly, ensuring distinct recognition amid new knowledge acquisition. Leveraging these insights, we propose Flashback, an FL algorithm with a dynamic <b>distillation</b> approach that is used to regularize the local models, and effectively aggregate their knowledge. Across different benchmarks, Flashback outperforms other methods, mitigates forgetting, and achieves faster round-to-target-accuracy, by converging in 6 to 16 rounds.

**ABSTRACT**  
Parkinson's disease is easy to diagnose when it is advanced, but it is very difficult to diagnose in its early stages. Early diagnosis is essential to be able to treat the symptoms. It impacts on daily activities and reduces the quality of life of both the patients and their families and it is also the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer in people over the age of 60. Most current studies on the prediction of Parkinson's severity are carried out in advanced stages of the disease. In this work, the study analyzes a set of variables that can be easily extracted from voice analysis, making it a very non-intrusive technique. In this paper, a method based on different deep learning techniques is proposed with two purposes. On the one hand, to find out if a person has severe or non-severe Parkinson's disease, and on the other hand, to determine by means of regression techniques the degree of evolution of the disease in a given patient. The UPDRS (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale) has been used by taking into account both the motor and total labels, and the best results have been obtained using a mixed multi-layer perceptron (MLP) that classifies and regresses at the same time and the most important features of the data obtained are taken as input, using an autoencoder. A success rate of 99.15% has been achieved in the problem of predicting whether a person suffers from severe Parkinson's disease or non-severe Parkinson's disease. In the degree of disease involvement prediction problem case, a MSE (Mean Squared Error) of 0.15 has been obtained. Using a full deep learning pipeline for data preprocessing and classification has proven to be very promising in the field Parkinson's outperforming the state-of-the-art proposals.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Reinforcement</b> <b>learning</b> (RL) is a classical tool to solve network control or policy optimization problems in unknown environments. The original Q-learning suffers from performance and complexity challenges across very large networks. Herein, a novel model-free ensemble <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning</b> algorithm which adapts the classical Q-learning is proposed to handle these challenges for networks which admit Markov decision process (MDP) models. Multiple Q-learning algorithms are run on multiple, distinct, synthetically created and structurally related Markovian environments in parallel; the outputs are fused using an adaptive weighting mechanism based on the Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) to obtain an approximately optimal policy with low complexity. The theoretical justification of the algorithm, including the convergence of key statistics and Q-functions are provided. Numerical results across several network models show that the proposed algorithm can achieve up to 55% less average policy error with up to 50% less runtime complexity than the state-of-the-art Q-learning algorithms. Numerical results validate assumptions made in the theoretical analysis.

**ABSTRACT**  
In reinforcement learning, temporal abstraction in the action space, exemplified by action repetition, is a technique to facilitate policy learning through extended actions. However, a primary limitation in previous studies of action repetition is its potential to degrade performance, particularly when sub-optimal actions are repeated. This issue often negates the advantages of action repetition. To address this, we propose a novel algorithm named Uncertainty-aware Temporal Extension (UTE). UTE employs ensemble methods to accurately measure uncertainty during action extension. This feature allows policies to strategically choose between emphasizing exploration or adopting an uncertainty-averse approach, tailored to their specific needs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of UTE through experiments in Gridworld and Atari 2600 environments. Our findings show that UTE outperforms existing action repetition algorithms, effectively mitigating their inherent limitations and significantly enhancing policy learning efficiency.

**ABSTRACT**  
Time series forecasting is essential for many practical applications, with the adoption of transformer-based models on the rise due to their impressive performance in NLP and CV. Transformers' key feature, the attention mechanism, dynamically fusing embeddings to enhance data representation, often relegating attention weights to a byproduct role. Yet, time series data, characterized by noise and non-stationarity, poses significant forecasting challenges. Our approach elevates attention weights as the primary representation for time series, capitalizing on the temporal relationships among data points to improve forecasting accuracy. Our study shows that an attention map, structured using global landmarks and local windows, acts as a robust kernel representation for data points, withstanding noise and shifts in distribution. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art models, reducing mean squared error (MSE) in multivariate time series forecasting by a notable 3.6% without altering the core neural network architecture. It serves as a versatile component that can readily replace recent patching based embedding schemes in transformer-based models, boosting their performance.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this work, we study statistical learning with dependent ($\beta$-mixing) data and <b>square</b> <b>loss</b> in a hypothesis class $\mathscr{F}\subset L_{\Psi_p}$ where $\Psi_p$ is the norm $\|f\|_{\Psi_p} \triangleq \sup_{m\geq 1} m^{-1/p} \|f\|_{L^m} $ for some $p\in [2,\infty]$. Our inquiry is motivated by the search for a sharp noise interaction term, or variance proxy, in learning with dependent data. Absent any realizability assumption, typical non-asymptotic results exhibit variance proxies that are deflated \emph{multiplicatively} by the mixing time of the underlying covariates process. We show that whenever the topologies of $L^2$ and $\Psi_p$ are comparable on our hypothesis class $\mathscr{F}$ -- that is, $\mathscr{F}$ is a weakly sub-Gaussian class: $\|f\|_{\Psi_p} \lesssim \|f\|_{L^2}^\eta$ for some $\eta\in (0,1]$ -- the empirical risk minimizer achieves a rate that only depends on the complexity of the class and second order statistics in its leading term. Our result holds whether the problem is realizable or not and we refer to this as a \emph{near mixing-free rate}, since direct dependence on mixing is relegated to an additive higher order term. We arrive at our result by combining the above notion of a weakly sub-Gaussian class with mixed tail generic chaining. This combination allows us to compute sharp, instance-optimal rates for a wide range of problems. %Our approach, reliant on mixed tail generic chaining, allows us to obtain sharp, instance-optimal rates. Examples that satisfy our framework include sub-Gaussian linear regression, more general smoothly parameterized function classes, finite hypothesis classes, and bounded smoothness classes.

**ABSTRACT**  
Many of the foundations of machine learning rely on the idealized premise that all input and output spaces are infinite, e.g.~$\mathbb{R}^d$. This core assumption is systematically violated in practice due to digital computing limitations from finite machine precision, rounding, and limited RAM. In short, digital computers operate on finite grids in $\mathbb{R}^d$. By exploiting these discrete structures, we show the curse of dimensionality in statistical learning is systematically broken when models are implemented on real computers. Consequentially, we obtain new generalization bounds with dimension-free rates for kernel and deep ReLU MLP regressors, which are implemented on real-world machines. Our results are derived using a new non-asymptotic concentration of measure result between a probability measure over any finite metric space and its empirical version associated with $N$ i.i.d. samples when measured in the $1$-Wasserstein distance. Unlike standard concentration of measure results, the concentration rates in our bounds do not hold uniformly for all sample sizes $N$; instead, our rates can adapt to any given $N$. This yields significantly tighter bounds for realistic sample sizes while achieving the optimal worst-case rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/N^{1/2})$ for massive. Our results are built on new techniques combining metric embedding theory with optimal transport

**ABSTRACT**  
Image Captioning generates descriptive sentences from images using <b>Vision-Language</b> Pre-trained models (VLPs) such as BLIP, which has improved greatly. However, current methods lack the generation of detailed descriptive captions for the cultural elements depicted in the images, such as the traditional clothing worn by people from Asian cultural groups. In this paper, we propose a new framework, \textbf{Culturally-aware Image Captioning (CIC)}, that generates captions and describes cultural elements extracted from cultural visual elements in images representing cultures. Inspired by methods combining visual modality and Large Language Models (LLMs) through appropriate prompts, our framework (1) generates questions based on cultural categories from images, (2) extracts cultural visual elements from <b>Visual</b> <b>Question</b> <b>Answering</b> (VQA) using generated questions, and (3) generates culturally-aware captions using LLMs with the prompts. Our human evaluation conducted on 45 participants from 4 different cultural groups with a high understanding of the corresponding culture shows that our proposed framework generates more culturally descriptive captions when compared to the image captioning baseline based on VLPs. Our code and dataset will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Vision-Language</b> (VL) models have gained significant research focus, enabling remarkable advances in multimodal reasoning. These architectures typically comprise a vision encoder, a <b>Large</b> <b>Language</b> <b>Model</b> (LLM), and a projection module that aligns visual features with the LLM's representation space. Despite their success, a critical limitation persists: the vision encoding process remains decoupled from user queries, often in the form of image-related questions. Consequently, the resulting visual features may not be optimally attuned to the query-specific elements of the image. To address this, we introduce QA-ViT, a Question Aware Vision <b>Transformer</b> approach for multimodal reasoning, which embeds question awareness directly within the vision encoder. This integration results in dynamic visual features focusing on relevant image aspects to the posed question. QA-ViT is model-agnostic and can be incorporated efficiently into any VL architecture. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of applying our method to various multimodal architectures, leading to consistent improvement across diverse tasks and showcasing its potential for enhancing visual and scene-text understanding.

**ABSTRACT**  
We propose SPHINX-X, an extensive Multimodality <b>Large</b> <b>Language</b> <b>Model</b> (MLLM) series developed upon SPHINX. To improve the architecture and training efficiency, we modify the SPHINX framework by removing redundant visual encoders, bypassing fully-padded sub-images with skip tokens, and simplifying multi-stage training into a one-stage all-in-one paradigm. To fully unleash the potential of MLLMs, we assemble a comprehensive multi-domain and multimodal dataset covering publicly available resources in language, vision, and <b>vision-language</b> tasks. We further enrich this collection with our curated <b>OCR</b> intensive and Set-of-Mark datasets, extending the diversity and generality. By training over different base LLMs including TinyLlama1.1B, InternLM2-7B, LLaMA2-13B, and Mixtral8x7B, we obtain a spectrum of MLLMs that vary in parameter size and multilingual capabilities. Comprehensive benchmarking reveals a strong correlation between the multi-modal performance with the data and parameter scales. Code and models are released at https://github.com/Alpha-VLLM/LLaMA2-Accessory

**ABSTRACT**  
Scene <b>simulation</b> in autonomous driving has gained significant attention because of its huge potential for generating customized data. However, existing editable scene <b>simulation</b> approaches face limitations in terms of user interaction efficiency, multi-camera photo-realistic rendering and external digital assets integration. To address these challenges, this paper introduces ChatSim, the first system that enables editable photo-realistic 3D driving scene simulations via natural language commands with external digital assets. To enable editing with high command flexibility,~ChatSim leverages a <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>model</b> (LLM) agent collaboration framework. To generate photo-realistic outcomes, ChatSim employs a novel multi-camera neural radiance field method. Furthermore, to unleash the potential of extensive high-quality digital assets, ChatSim employs a novel multi-camera lighting estimation method to achieve scene-consistent assets' rendering. Our experiments on Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate that ChatSim can handle complex language commands and generate corresponding photo-realistic scene videos.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recently, Class-Agnostic Counting (CAC) problem has garnered increasing attention owing to its intriguing generality and superior efficiency compared to Category-Specific Counting (CSC). This paper proposes a novel ExpressCount to enhance <b>zero-shot</b> object counting by delving deeply into language-guided exemplar learning. Specifically, the ExpressCount is comprised of an innovative Language-oriented Exemplar Perceptron and a downstream visual <b>Zero-shot</b> Counting pipeline. Thereinto, the perceptron hammers at exploiting accurate exemplar cues from collaborative language-vision signals by inheriting rich semantic priors from the prevailing pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs), whereas the counting pipeline excels in mining fine-grained features through dual-branch and cross-attention schemes, contributing to the high-quality similarity learning. Apart from building a bridge between the <b>LLM</b> in vogue and the visual counting tasks, expression-guided exemplar estimation significantly advances <b>zero-shot</b> <b>learning</b> capabilities for counting instances with arbitrary classes. Moreover, devising a FSC-147-Express with annotations of meticulous linguistic expressions pioneers a new venue for developing and validating language-based counting models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our ExpressCount, even showcasing the accuracy on par with partial CSC models.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this paper, we introduce a novel paradigm to enhance the ability of object detector, e.g., expanding categories or improving detection performance, by training on synthetic dataset generated from diffusion models. Specifically, we integrate an instance-level <b>grounding</b> head into a pre-trained, generative diffusion model, to augment it with the ability of localising arbitrary instances in the generated images. The <b>grounding</b> head is trained to align the <b>text</b> <b>embedding</b> of category names with the regional visual feature of the diffusion model, using supervision from an off-the-shelf object detector, and a novel self-training scheme on (novel) categories not covered by the detector. This enhanced version of diffusion model, termed as InstaGen, can serve as a data synthesizer for object detection. We conduct thorough experiments to show that, object detector can be enhanced while training on the synthetic dataset from InstaGen, demonstrating superior performance over existing state-of-the-art methods in open-vocabulary (+4.5 AP) and data-sparse (+1.2 to 5.2 AP) scenarios.

**ABSTRACT**  
The newly released Segment Anything Model (SAM) is a popular tool used in image processing due to its superior segmentation accuracy, variety of input prompts, training capabilities, and efficient model design. However, its current model is trained on a diverse dataset not tailored to medical images, particularly ultrasound images. Ultrasound images tend to have a lot of noise, making it difficult to segment out important structures. In this project, we developed ClickSAM, which fine-tunes the Segment Anything Model using click prompts for ultrasound images. ClickSAM has two stages of training: the first stage is trained on single-click prompts centered in the ground-truth contours, and the second stage focuses on improving the model performance through additional positive and negative click prompts. By comparing the first stage predictions to the ground-truth masks, true positive, false positive, and false negative segments are calculated. Positive clicks are generated using the true positive and false negative segments, and negative clicks are generated using the false positive segments. The Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation algorithm is then employed to collect positive and negative click prompts in each segment that are used to enhance the model performance during the second stage of training. With click-train methods, ClickSAM exhibits superior performance compared to other existing models for ultrasound image segmentation.

**ABSTRACT**  
Despite impressive advancements in multimodal compositional <b>reasoning</b> approaches, they are still limited in their flexibility and efficiency by processing fixed modality inputs while updating a lot of model parameters. This paper tackles these critical challenges and proposes CREMA, an efficient and modular modality-fusion framework for injecting any new modality into video reasoning. We first augment multiple informative modalities (such as optical flow, 3D point cloud, audio) from given videos without extra human annotation by leveraging existing pre-trained models. Next, we introduce a query <b>transformer</b> with multiple parameter-efficient modules associated with each accessible modality. It projects diverse modality features to the <b>LLM</b> token embedding space, allowing the model to integrate different data types for response generation. Furthermore, we propose a fusion module designed to compress multimodal queries, maintaining computational efficiency in the <b>LLM</b> while combining additional modalities. We validate our method on video-3D, video-audio, and video-language <b>reasoning</b> tasks and achieve better/equivalent performance against strong multimodal LLMs, including BLIP-2, 3D-LLM, and SeViLA while using 96% fewer trainable parameters. We provide extensive analyses of CREMA, including the impact of each modality on <b>reasoning</b> domains, the design of the fusion module, and example visualizations.

**ABSTRACT**  
While a variety of methods offer good yield prediction on histogrammed remote sensing data, vision Transformers are only sparsely represented in the literature. The <b>Convolution</b> vision <b>Transformer</b> (CvT) is being tested to evaluate vision Transformers that are currently achieving state-of-the-art results in many other vision tasks. CvT combines some of the advantages of <b>convolution</b> with the advantages of dynamic attention and global context fusion of Transformers. It performs worse than widely tested methods such as XGBoost and CNNs, but shows that Transformers have potential to improve yield prediction.

**ABSTRACT**  
We present a compact spiking <b>convolutional</b> <b>neural</b> <b>network</b> (SCNN) and spiking multilayer perceptron (SMLP) to recognize ten different gestures in dark and bright light environments, using a $9.6 single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) array. In our hand gesture recognition (HGR) system, photon intensity data was leveraged to train and test the network. A vanilla <b>convolutional</b> <b>neural</b> <b>network</b> (CNN) was also implemented to compare the performance of SCNN with the same network topologies and training strategies. Our SCNN was trained from scratch instead of being converted from the CNN. We tested the three models in dark and ambient light (AL)-corrupted environments. The results indicate that SCNN achieves comparable accuracy (90.8%) to <b>CNN</b> (92.9%) and exhibits lower floating operations with only 8 timesteps. SMLP also presents a trade-off between computational workload and accuracy. The code and collected datasets of this work are available at https://github.com/zzy666666zzy/TinyLiDAR_NET_SNN.

**ABSTRACT**  
Masked Autoencoder~(MAE) is a prevailing <b>self-supervised</b> <b>learning</b> method that achieves promising results in model pre-training. However, when the various downstream tasks have data distributions different from the pre-training data, the semantically irrelevant pre-training information might result in negative transfer, impeding MAE's scalability. To address this issue, we propose a novel MAE-based pre-training paradigm, Mixture of Cluster-conditional Experts (MoCE), which can be trained once but provides customized pre-training models for diverse downstream tasks. Different from the mixture of experts (MoE), our MoCE trains each expert only with semantically relevant images by using cluster-conditional gates. Thus, each downstream task can be allocated to its customized model pre-trained with data most similar to the downstream data. Experiments on a collection of 11 downstream tasks show that MoCE outperforms the vanilla MAE by 2.45\% on average. It also obtains new state-of-the-art <b>self-supervised</b> <b>learning</b> results on detection and segmentation.

The success of recent <b>text-to-image</b> diffusion models is largely due to their capacity to be guided by a complex text prompt, which enables users to precisely describe the desired content. However, these models struggle to effectively suppress the generation of undesired content, which is explicitly requested to be omitted from the generated image in the prompt. In this paper, we analyze how to manipulate the text embeddings and remove unwanted content from them. We introduce two contributions, which we refer to as $\textit{soft-weighted regularization}$ and $\textit{inference-time <b>text</b> <b>embedding</b> optimization}$. The first regularizes the <b>text</b> <b>embedding</b> matrix and effectively suppresses the undesired content. The second method aims to further suppress the unwanted content generation of the prompt, and encourages the generation of desired content. We evaluate our method quantitatively and qualitatively on extensive experiments, validating its effectiveness. Furthermore, our method is generalizability to both the pixel-space diffusion models (i.e. DeepFloyd-IF) and the latent-space diffusion models (i.e. Stable Diffusion).

**ABSTRACT**  
Current state-of-the-art Video Object Segmentation (VOS) methods rely on dense per-object mask annotations both during training and testing. This requires time-consuming and costly video annotation mechanisms. We propose a novel Point-VOS task with a spatio-temporally sparse point-wise annotation scheme that substantially reduces the annotation effort. We apply our annotation scheme to two large-scale video datasets with text descriptions and annotate over 19M points across 133K objects in 32K videos. Based on our annotations, we propose a new Point-VOS benchmark, and a corresponding point-based training mechanism, which we use to establish strong baseline results. We show that existing VOS methods can easily be adapted to leverage our point annotations during training, and can achieve results close to the fully-supervised performance when trained on pseudo-masks generated from these points. In addition, we show that our data can be used to improve models that connect vision and language, by evaluating it on the Video Narrative <b>Grounding</b> (VNG) task. We will make our code and annotations available at https://pointvos.github.io.

**ABSTRACT**  
In recent years, Transformers have become the de-facto architecture for sequence modeling on text and a variety of multi-dimensional data, such as images and video. However, the use of <b>self-attention</b> layers in a <b>Transformer</b> incurs prohibitive compute and memory complexity that scales quadratically w.r.t. the sequence length. A recent architecture, Mamba, based on state space models has been shown to achieve comparable performance for modeling text sequences, while scaling linearly with the sequence length. In this work, we present Mamba-ND, a generalized design extending the Mamba architecture to arbitrary multi-dimensional data. Our design alternatively unravels the input data across different dimensions following row-major orderings. We provide a systematic comparison of Mamba-ND with several other alternatives, based on prior multi-dimensional extensions such as Bi-directional LSTMs and S4ND. Empirically, we show that Mamba-ND demonstrates performance competitive with the state-of-the-art on a variety of multi-dimensional benchmarks, including ImageNet-1K classification, HMDB-51 action recognition, and ERA5 weather forecasting.

**ABSTRACT**  
Most transformer-based video encoders are limited to short temporal contexts due to their quadratic complexity. While various attempts have been made to extend this context, this has often come at the cost of both conceptual and computational complexity. We propose to instead re-purpose existing pre-trained video transformers by simply <b>fine-tuning</b> them to attend to memories derived non-parametrically from past activations. By leveraging redundancy reduction, our memory-consolidated vision <b>transformer</b> (MC-ViT) effortlessly extends its context far into the past and exhibits excellent scaling behavior when learning from longer videos. In doing so, MC-ViT sets a new state-of-the-art in long-context video understanding on EgoSchema, Perception Test, and Diving48, outperforming methods that benefit from orders of magnitude more parameters.

**ABSTRACT**  
Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) based semantic segmentation of the robotic instruments and tissues can enhance the precision of surgical activities in robot-assisted surgery. However, in biological learning, DNNs cannot learn incremental tasks over time and exhibit catastrophic forgetting, which refers to the sharp decline in performance on previously learned tasks after learning a new one. Specifically, when data scarcity is the issue, the model shows a rapid drop in performance on previously learned instruments after learning new data with new instruments. The problem becomes worse when it limits releasing the dataset of the old instruments for the old model due to privacy concerns and the unavailability of the data for the new or updated version of the instruments for the <b>continual</b> <b>learning</b> model. For this purpose, we develop a privacy-preserving synthetic continual semantic segmentation framework by blending and harmonizing (i) open-source old instruments foreground to the synthesized background without revealing real patient data in public and (ii) new instruments foreground to extensively augmented real background. To boost the balanced logit <b>distillation</b> from the old model to the <b>continual</b> <b>learning</b> model, we design overlapping class-aware temperature normalization (CAT) by controlling model learning utility. We also introduce multi-scale shifted-feature <b>distillation</b> (SD) to maintain long and short-range spatial relationships among the semantic objects where conventional short-range spatial features with limited information reduce the power of feature distillation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on the EndoVis 2017 and 2018 instrument segmentation dataset with a generalized <b>continual</b> <b>learning</b> setting. Code is available at~\url{https://github.com/XuMengyaAmy/Synthetic_CAT_SD}.

**ABSTRACT**  
We introduce an approach for 3D head avatar generation and editing with multi-modal conditioning based on a 3D <b>Generative</b> <b>Adversarial</b> <b>Network</b> (GAN) and a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM). 3D GANs can generate high-quality head avatars given a single or no condition. However, it is challenging to generate samples that adhere to multiple conditions of different modalities. On the other hand, LDMs excel at learning complex conditional distributions. To this end, we propose to exploit the conditioning capabilities of LDMs to enable multi-modal control over the latent space of a pre-trained 3D GAN. Our method can generate and edit 3D head avatars given a mixture of control signals such as RGB input, segmentation masks, and global attributes. This provides better control over the generation and editing of synthetic avatars both globally and locally. Experiments show that our proposed approach outperforms a solely GAN-based approach both qualitatively and quantitatively on generation and editing tasks. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first to introduce multi-modal conditioning to 3D avatar generation and editing. \\href{avatarmmc-sig24.github.io}{Project Page}

**ABSTRACT**  
Estimating robot pose from RGB images is a crucial problem in computer vision and robotics. While previous methods have achieved promising performance, most of them presume full knowledge of robot internal states, e.g. ground-truth robot joint angles, which are not always available in real-world scenarios. On the other hand, existing approaches that estimate robot pose without joint state priors suffer from heavy computation burdens and thus cannot support real-time applications. This work addresses the urgent need for efficient robot pose estimation with unknown states. We propose an end-to-end pipeline for real-time, holistic robot pose estimation from a single RGB image, even in the absence of known robot states. Our method decomposes the problem into estimating camera-to-robot rotation, robot state parameters, keypoint locations, and root depth. We further design a corresponding neural network module for each task. This approach allows for learning multi-facet representations and facilitates sim-to-real transfer through <b>self-supervised</b> learning. Notably, our method achieves inference with a single feedforward, eliminating the need for costly test-time iterative optimization. As a result, it delivers a 12-time speed boost with state-of-the-art accuracy, enabling real-time holistic robot pose estimation for the first time.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper presents a new exploration into a category of diffusion models built upon state space architecture. We endeavor to train diffusion models for image data, wherein the traditional U-Net backbone is supplanted by a state space backbone, functioning on raw patches or latent space. Given its notable efficacy in accommodating long-range dependencies, Diffusion State Space Models (DiS) are distinguished by treating all inputs including time, condition, and noisy image patches as tokens. Our assessment of DiS encompasses both unconditional and class-conditional image generation scenarios, revealing that DiS exhibits comparable, if not superior, performance to CNN-based or Transformer-based U-Net architectures of commensurate size. Furthermore, we analyze the scalability of DiS, gauged by the forward pass complexity quantified in Gflops. DiS models with higher Gflops, achieved through augmentation of depth/width or augmentation of input tokens, consistently demonstrate lower FID. In addition to demonstrating commendable scalability characteristics, DiS-H/2 models in latent space achieve performance levels akin to prior diffusion models on class-conditional ImageNet benchmarks at the resolution of 256$\times$256 and 512$\times$512, while significantly reducing the computational burden. The code and models are available at: https://github.com/feizc/DiS.

**ABSTRACT**  
Referring expression segmentation (RES), a task that involves localizing specific instance-level objects based on free-form linguistic descriptions, has emerged as a crucial frontier in human-AI interaction. It demands an intricate understanding of both visual and textual contexts and often requires extensive training data. This paper introduces RESMatch, the first <b>semi-supervised</b> <b>learning</b> (SSL) approach for RES, aimed at reducing reliance on exhaustive data annotation. Extensive validation on multiple RES datasets demonstrates that RESMatch significantly outperforms baseline approaches, establishing a new state-of-the-art. Although existing SSL techniques are effective in image segmentation, we find that they fall short in RES. Facing the challenges including the comprehension of free-form linguistic descriptions and the variability in object attributes, RESMatch introduces a trifecta of adaptations: revised strong perturbation, text augmentation, and adjustments for pseudo-label quality and strong-weak supervision. This pioneering work lays the groundwork for future research in <b>semi-supervised</b> <b>learning</b> for referring expression segmentation.

**ABSTRACT**  
Captcha are widely used to secure systems from automatic responses by distinguishing computer responses from human responses. Text, audio, video, picture picture-based <b>Optical</b> <b>Character</b> <b>Recognition</b> (OCR) are used for creating captcha. Text-based <b>OCR</b> captcha are the most often used captcha which faces issues namely, complex and distorted contents. There are attempts to build captcha detection and classification-based systems using machine learning and neural networks, which need to be tuned for accuracy. The existing systems face challenges in the recognition of distorted characters, handling variable-length captcha and finding sequential dependencies in captcha. In this work, we propose a segmentation-free <b>OCR</b> model for text captcha classification based on the connectionist temporal classification loss technique. The proposed model is trained and tested on a publicly available captcha dataset. The proposed model gives 99.80\% character level accuracy, while 95\% word level accuracy. The accuracy of the proposed model is compared with the state-of-the-art models and proves to be effective. The variable length complex captcha can be thus processed with the segmentation-free connectionist temporal classification loss technique with dependencies which will be massively used in securing the software systems.

**ABSTRACT**  
Current 3D content generation builds on generative models that output RGB images. Modern graphics pipelines, however, require physically-based rendering (PBR) material properties. We propose to model the PBR image distribution directly to avoid photometric inaccuracies in RGB generation and the inherent ambiguity in extracting PBR from RGB. Existing paradigms for cross-modal finetuning are not suited for PBR generation due to a lack of data and the high dimensionality of the output modalities: we overcome both challenges by retaining a frozen RGB model and tightly linking a newly trained PBR model using a novel cross-network communication paradigm. As the base RGB model is fully frozen, the proposed method does not risk catastrophic forgetting during finetuning and remains compatible with techniques such as IPAdapter pretrained for the base RGB model. We validate our design choices, robustness to data sparsity, and compare against existing paradigms with an extensive experimental section.

**ABSTRACT**  
In the context of rapid advancements in industrial automation, vision-based robotic grasping plays an increasingly crucial role. In order to enhance visual recognition accuracy, the utilization of large-scale datasets is imperative for training models to acquire implicit knowledge related to the handling of various objects. Creating datasets from scratch is a time and labor-intensive process. Moreover, existing datasets often contain errors due to automated annotations aimed at expediency, making the improvement of these datasets a substantial research challenge. Consequently, several issues have been identified in the annotation of grasp bounding boxes within the popular Jacquard Grasp. We propose utilizing a Human-In-The-Loop(HIL) method to enhance dataset quality. This approach relies on backbone deep learning networks to predict object positions and orientations for robotic grasping. Predictions with Intersection over Union (IOU) values below 0.2 undergo an assessment by human operators. After their evaluation, the data is categorized into False Negatives(FN) and True Negatives(TN). FN are then subcategorized into either missing annotations or catastrophic labeling errors. Images lacking labels are augmented with valid grasp bounding box information, whereas images afflicted by catastrophic labeling errors are completely removed. The open-source tool Labelbee was employed for 53,026 iterations of HIL dataset enhancement, leading to the removal of 2,884 images and the incorporation of ground truth information for 30,292 images. The enhanced dataset, named the Jacquard V2 Grasping Dataset, served as the training data for a range of neural networks.

**ABSTRACT**  
Speech-driven 3D facial animation is important for many multimedia applications. Recent work has shown promise in using either Diffusion models or <b>Transformer</b> architectures for this task. However, their mere aggregation does not lead to improved performance. We suspect this is due to a shortage of paired audio-4D data, which is crucial for the <b>Transformer</b> to effectively perform as a denoiser within the Diffusion framework. To tackle this issue, we present DiffSpeaker, a Transformer-based network equipped with novel biased conditional attention modules. These modules serve as substitutes for the traditional self/cross-attention in standard Transformers, incorporating thoughtfully designed biases that steer the attention mechanisms to concentrate on both the relevant task-specific and diffusion-related conditions. We also explore the trade-off between accurate lip synchronization and non-verbal facial expressions within the Diffusion paradigm. Experiments show our model not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on existing benchmarks, but also fast inference speed owing to its ability to generate facial motions in parallel.

**ABSTRACT**  
Plankton recognition provides novel possibilities to study various environmental aspects and an interesting real-world context to develop <b>domain</b> <b>adaptation</b> (DA) methods. Different imaging instruments cause domain shift between datasets hampering the development of general plankton recognition methods. A promising remedy for this is DA allowing to adapt a model trained on one instrument to other instruments. In this paper, we present a new DA dataset called DAPlankton which consists of phytoplankton images obtained with different instruments. Phytoplankton provides a challenging DA problem due to the fine-grained nature of the task and high class imbalance in real-world datasets. DAPlankton consists of two subsets. DAPlankton_LAB contains images of cultured phytoplankton providing a balanced dataset with minimal label uncertainty. DAPlankton_SEA consists of images collected from the Baltic Sea providing challenging real-world data with large intra-class variance and class imbalance. We further present a benchmark comparison of three widely used DA methods.

**ABSTRACT**  
The recognition performance of biometric systems strongly depends on the quality of the compared biometric samples. Motivated by the goal of establishing a common understanding of face image quality and enabling system interoperability, the committee draft of ISO/IEC 29794-5 introduces expression neutrality as one of many component quality elements affecting recognition performance. In this study, we train classifiers to assess facial expression neutrality using seven datasets. We conduct extensive performance benchmarking to evaluate their classification and <b>face</b> <b>recognition</b> utility prediction abilities. Our experiments reveal significant differences in how each classifier distinguishes "neutral" from "non-neutral" expressions. While Random Forests and AdaBoost classifiers are most suitable for distinguishing neutral from non-neutral facial expressions with high accuracy, they underperform compared to Support Vector Machines in predicting <b>face</b> <b>recognition</b> utility.

**ABSTRACT**  
We present a Multi-Instance Generation (MIG) task, simultaneously generating multiple instances with diverse controls in one image. Given a set of predefined coordinates and their corresponding descriptions, the task is to ensure that generated instances are accurately at the designated locations and that all instances' attributes adhere to their corresponding description. This broadens the scope of current research on Single-instance generation, elevating it to a more versatile and practical dimension. Inspired by the idea of divide and conquer, we introduce an innovative approach named Multi-Instance Generation Controller (MIGC) to address the challenges of the MIG task. Initially, we break down the MIG task into several subtasks, each involving the shading of a single instance. To ensure precise shading for each instance, we introduce an instance enhancement attention mechanism. Lastly, we aggregate all the shaded instances to provide the necessary information for accurately generating multiple instances in stable diffusion (SD). To evaluate how well generation models perform on the MIG task, we provide a COCO-MIG benchmark along with an evaluation pipeline. Extensive experiments were conducted on the proposed COCO-MIG benchmark, as well as on various commonly used benchmarks. The evaluation results illustrate the exceptional control capabilities of our model in terms of quantity, position, attribute, and interaction.

**ABSTRACT**  
A significant volume of analog information, i.e., documents and images, have been digitized in the form of scanned copies for storing, sharing, and/or analyzing in the digital world. However, the quality of such contents is severely degraded by various distortions caused by printing, storing, and scanning processes in the physical world. Although restoring high-quality content from scanned copies has become an indispensable task for many products, it has not been systematically explored, and to the best of our knowledge, no public datasets are available. In this paper, we define this problem as Descanning and introduce a new high-quality and large-scale dataset named DESCAN-18K. It contains 18K pairs of original and scanned images collected in the wild containing multiple complex degradations. In order to eliminate such complex degradations, we propose a new image restoration model called DescanDiffusion consisting of a color encoder that corrects the global color degradation and a conditional denoising diffusion <b>probabilistic</b> <b>model</b> (DDPM) that removes local degradations. To further improve the generalization ability of DescanDiffusion, we also design a synthetic data generation scheme by reproducing prominent degradations in scanned images. We demonstrate that our DescanDiffusion outperforms other baselines including commercial restoration products, objectively and subjectively, via comprehensive experiments and analyses.

**ABSTRACT**  
Early wildfire detection is of the utmost importance to enable rapid response efforts, and thus minimize the negative impacts of wildfire spreads. To this end, we present \Pyro, a web-scraping-based dataset composed of videos of wildfires from a network of cameras that were enhanced with manual bounding-box-level annotations. Our dataset was filtered based on a strategy to improve the quality and diversity of the data, reducing the final data to a set of 10,000 images. We ran experiments using a state-of-the-art <b>object</b> <b>detection</b> model and found out that the proposed dataset is challenging and its use in concordance with other public dataset helps to reach higher results overall. We will make our code and data publicly available.

**ABSTRACT**  
Misuse of the Large Language Models (LLMs) has raised widespread concern. To address this issue, safeguards have been taken to ensure that LLMs align with social ethics. However, recent findings have revealed an unsettling vulnerability bypassing the safeguards of LLMs, known as jailbreak attacks. By applying techniques, such as employing role-playing scenarios, adversarial examples, or subtle subversion of safety objectives as a prompt, LLMs can produce an inappropriate or even harmful response. While researchers have studied several categories of jailbreak attacks, they have done so in isolation. To fill this gap, we present the first large-scale measurement of various jailbreak attack methods. We concentrate on 13 cutting-edge jailbreak methods from four categories, 160 questions from 16 violation categories, and six popular LLMs. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that the optimized jailbreak prompts consistently achieve the highest attack success rates, as well as exhibit robustness across different LLMs. Some jailbreak <b>prompt</b> datasets, available from the Internet, can also achieve high attack success rates on many LLMs, such as ChatGLM3, GPT-3.5, and PaLM2. Despite the claims from many organizations regarding the coverage of violation categories in their policies, the attack success rates from these categories remain high, indicating the challenges of effectively aligning <b>LLM</b> policies and the ability to counter jailbreak attacks. We also discuss the trade-off between the attack performance and efficiency, as well as show that the transferability of the jailbreak prompts is still viable, becoming an option for black-box models. Overall, our research highlights the necessity of evaluating different jailbreak methods. We hope our study can provide insights for future research on jailbreak attacks and serve as a benchmark tool for evaluating them for practitioners.

**ABSTRACT**  
Next-generation networks aim for comprehensive connectivity, interconnecting humans, machines, devices, and systems seamlessly. This interconnectivity raises concerns about privacy and security, given the potential network-wide impact of a single compromise. To address this challenge, the <b>Zero</b> <b>Trust</b> (ZT) paradigm emerges as a key method for safeguarding network integrity and data confidentiality. This work introduces EPS-CNN, a novel deep-learning-based wireless device identification framework designed to serve as the device authentication layer within the ZT architecture, with a focus on resource-constrained IoT devices. At the core of EPS-CNN, a <b>Convolutional</b> <b>Neural</b> <b>Network</b> (CNN) is utilized to generate the device identity from a unique RF signal representation, known as the Double-Sided Envelope Power Spectrum (EPS), which effectively captures the device-specific hardware characteristics while ignoring device-unrelated information. Experimental evaluations show that the proposed framework achieves over 99%, 93%, and 95% testing accuracy when tested in same-domain (day, location, and channel), cross-day, and cross-location scenarios, respectively. Our findings demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework in enhancing the accuracy, robustness, and adaptability of deep learning-based methods, thus offering a pioneering solution for enabling ZT IoT device identification.

**ABSTRACT**  
Mixture of Experts (MoE) has become a key ingredient for scaling large foundation models while keeping inference costs steady. We show that expert routing strategies that have cross-batch dependencies are vulnerable to attacks. Malicious queries can be sent to a model and can affect a model's output on other benign queries if they are grouped in the same batch. We demonstrate this via a proof-of-concept attack in a toy experimental setting.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper explores Physical-Layer Security (PLS) in Flexible Duplex (FlexD) networks, considering scenarios involving eavesdroppers. Our investigation revolves around the intricacies of the sum secrecy rate maximization problem, particularly when faced with coordinated and distributed eavesdroppers employing a Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) receiver. Our contributions include an iterative classical optimization solution and an <b>unsupervised</b> <b>learning</b> strategy based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). To the best of our knowledge, this work marks the initial exploration of GNNs for PLS applications. Additionally, we extend the <b>GNN</b> approach to address the absence of eavesdroppers' channel knowledge. Extensive numerical simulations highlight FlexD's superiority over Half-Duplex (HD) communications and the <b>GNN</b> approach's superiority over the classical method in both performance and time complexity.

**ABSTRACT**  
In practical scenarios involving the measurement of surface electromyography (sEMG) in muscles, particularly those areas near the heart, one of the primary sources of contamination is the presence of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. To assess the quality of real-world sEMG data more effectively, this study proposes QASE-net, a new non-intrusive model that predicts the SNR of sEMG signals. QASE-net combines CNN-BLSTM with attention mechanisms and follows an end-to-end training strategy. Our experimental framework utilizes real-world sEMG and ECG data from two open-access databases, the Non-Invasive Adaptive Prosthetics Database and the MIT-BIH Normal Sinus Rhythm Database, respectively. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of QASE-net over the previous assessment model, exhibiting significantly reduced prediction errors and notably higher linear correlations with the ground truth. These findings show the potential of QASE-net to substantially enhance the reliability and precision of sEMG quality assessment in practical applications.

**ABSTRACT**  
Following on recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and subsequent chat models, a new wave of large <b>vision-language</b> models (LVLMs) has emerged. Such models can incorporate images as input in addition to text, and perform tasks such as visual question answering, image captioning, story generation, etc. Here, we examine potential gender and racial biases in such systems, based on the perceived characteristics of the people in the input images. To accomplish this, we present a new dataset PAIRS (PArallel Images for eveRyday Scenarios). The PAIRS dataset contains sets of AI-generated images of people, such that the images are highly similar in terms of background and visual content, but differ along the dimensions of gender (man, woman) and race (Black, white). By querying the LVLMs with such images, we observe significant differences in the responses according to the perceived gender or race of the person depicted.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Face</b> <b>recognition</b> (FR) has reached a high technical maturity. However, its use needs to be carefully assessed from an ethical perspective, especially in sensitive scenarios. This is precisely the focus of this paper: the use of FR for the identification of specific subjects in moderately to densely crowded spaces (e.g. public spaces, sports stadiums, train stations) and law enforcement scenarios. In particular, there is a need to consider the trade-off between the need to protect privacy and fundamental rights of citizens as well as their safety. Recent Artificial Intelligence (AI) policies, notably the European AI Act, propose that such FR interventions should be proportionate and deployed only when strictly necessary. Nevertheless, concrete guidelines on how to address the concept of proportional FR intervention are lacking to date. This paper proposes a framework to contribute to assessing whether an FR intervention is proportionate or not for a given context of use in the above mentioned scenarios. It also identifies the main quantitative and qualitative variables relevant to the FR intervention decision (e.g. number of people in the scene, level of harm that the person(s) in search could perpetrate, consequences to individual rights and freedoms) and propose a 2D graphical model making it possible to balance these variables in terms of ethical cost vs security gain. Finally, different FR scenarios inspired by real-world deployments validate the proposed model. The framework is conceived as a simple support tool for decision makers when confronted with the deployment of an FR system.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recommender systems are designed to learn user preferences from observed feedback and comprise many fundamental tasks, such as rating prediction and post-click conversion rate (pCVR) prediction. However, the observed feedback usually suffer from two issues: selection bias and data sparsity, where biased and insufficient feedback seriously degrade the performance of recommender systems in terms of accuracy and ranking. Existing solutions for handling the issues, such as data imputation and inverse propensity score, are highly susceptible to additional trained imputation or propensity models. In this work, we propose a novel counterfactual <b>contrastive</b> <b>learning</b> framework for recommendation, named CounterCLR, to tackle the problem of non-random missing data by exploiting the advances in contrast learning. Specifically, the proposed CounterCLR employs a deep representation network, called CauNet, to infer non-random missing data in recommendations and perform user preference modeling by further introducing a <b>self-supervised</b> <b>contrastive</b> <b>learning</b> task. Our CounterCLR mitigates the selection bias problem without the need for additional models or estimators, while also enhancing the generalization ability in cases of sparse data. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method.

**ABSTRACT**  
Current state-of-the-art recommender systems predominantly rely on either implicit or explicit feedback from users to suggest new items. While effective in recommending novel options, these conventional systems often use uninterpretable embeddings. This lack of transparency not only limits user understanding of why certain items are suggested but also reduces the user's ability to easily scrutinize and edit their preferences. For example, if a user has a change in interests, they would need to make significant changes to their interaction history to adjust the model's recommendations. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel method that utilizes user reviews to craft personalized, natural language profiles describing users' preferences. Through these descriptive profiles, our system provides transparent recommendations in natural language. Our evaluations show that this novel approach maintains a performance level on par with established recommender systems, but with the added benefits of transparency and user control. By enabling users to scrutinize why certain items are recommended, they can more easily verify, adjust, and have greater autonomy over their recommendations.

**ABSTRACT**  
Adapting driving behavior to new environments, customs, and laws is a long-standing problem in autonomous driving, precluding the widespread deployment of autonomous vehicles (AVs). In this paper, we present LLaDA, a simple yet powerful tool that enables human drivers and autonomous vehicles alike to drive everywhere by adapting their tasks and motion plans to traffic rules in new locations. LLaDA achieves this by leveraging the impressive <b>zero-shot</b> generalizability of large language models (LLMs) in interpreting the traffic rules in the local driver handbook. Through an extensive user study, we show that LLaDA's instructions are useful in disambiguating in-the-wild unexpected situations. We also demonstrate LLaDA's ability to adapt AV motion planning policies in real-world datasets; LLaDA outperforms baseline planning approaches on all our metrics.

**ABSTRACT**  
The availability of a reliable map and a robust localization system is critical for the operation of an autonomous vehicle. In a modern system, both mapping and localization solutions generally employ <b>convolutional</b> <b>neural</b> <b>network</b> (CNN) --based perception. Hence, any algorithm should consider potential errors in perception for safe and robust functioning. In this work, we present uncertainty-aware panoptic Localization and Mapping (uPLAM), which employs perception uncertainty as a bridge to fuse the perception information with classical localization and mapping approaches. We introduce an uncertainty-based map aggregation technique to create a long-term panoptic bird's eye view map and provide an associated mapping uncertainty. Our map consists of surface semantics and landmarks with unique IDs. Moreover, we present panoptic uncertainty-aware particle filter-based localization. To this end, we propose an uncertainty-based particle importance weight calculation for the adaptive incorporation of perception information into localization. We also present a new dataset for evaluating long-term panoptic mapping and map-based localization. Extensive evaluations showcase that our proposed uncertainty incorporation leads to better mapping with reliable uncertainty estimates and accurate localization. We make our dataset and code available at: \url{http://uplam.cs.uni-freiburg.de}

**ABSTRACT**  
Recent studies have demonstrated the immense potential of exploiting muscle actuator morphology for natural and robust movement -- in simulation. A validation on real robotic hardware is yet missing. In this study, we emulate muscle actuator properties on hardware in real-time, taking advantage of modern and affordable electric motors. We demonstrate that our setup can emulate a simplified muscle model on a real robot while being controlled by a learned policy. We improve upon an existing muscle model by deriving a damping rule that ensures that the model is not only performant and stable but also tuneable for the real hardware. Our policies are trained by <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning</b> entirely in simulation, where we show that previously reported benefits of muscles extend to the case of quadruped locomotion and hopping: the learned policies are more robust and exhibit more regular gaits. Finally, we confirm that the learned policies can be executed on real hardware and show that sim-to-real transfer with real-time emulated muscles on a quadruped robot is possible. These results show that artificial muscles can be highly beneficial actuators for future generations of robust legged robots.

**ABSTRACT**  
This article introduces an experimental emulation of a novel chunk-based flexible multi-DoF aerial 3D printing framework. The experimental demonstration of the overall autonomy focuses on precise motion planning and task allocation for a UAV, traversing through a series of planned space-filling paths involved in the aerial 3D printing process without physically depositing the overlaying material. The flexible multi-DoF aerial 3D printing is a newly developed framework and has the potential to strategically distribute the envisioned 3D model to be printed into small, manageable chunks suitable for distributed 3D printing. Moreover, by harnessing the dexterous flexibility due to the 6 DoF motion of UAV, the framework enables the provision of integrating the overall autonomy stack, potentially opening up an entirely new frontier in additive manufacturing. However, it's essential to note that the feasibility of this pioneering concept is still in its very early stage of development, which yet needs to be experimentally verified. Towards this direction, experimental emulation serves as the crucial stepping stone, providing a pseudo mockup scenario by virtual material deposition, helping to identify technological gaps from <b>simulation</b> to reality. Experimental emulation results, supported by critical analysis and discussion, lay the foundation for addressing the technological and research challenges to significantly push the boundaries of the state-of-the-art 3D printing mechanism.

**ABSTRACT**  
Humans use tools to complete impact-aware tasks such as hammering a nail or playing tennis. The postures adopted to use these tools can significantly influence the performance of these tasks, where the force or velocity of the hand holding a tool plays a crucial role. The underlying motion planning challenge consists of grabbing the tool in preparation for the use of this tool with an optimal body posture. Directional manipulability describes the dexterity of force and velocity in a joint configuration along a specific direction. In order to take directional manipulability and tool affordances into account, we apply an optimal control method combining iterative linear quadratic regulator(iLQR) with the alternating direction method of multipliers(ADMM). Our approach considers the notion of tool affordances to solve motion planning problems, by introducing a cost based on directional velocity manipulability. The proposed approach is applied to impact tasks in <b>simulation</b> and on a real 7-axis robot, specifically in a nail-hammering task with the assistance of a pilot hole. Our comparison study demonstrates the importance of maximizing directional manipulability in impact-aware tasks.

**ABSTRACT**  
Robotic systems are typically composed of various subsystems, such as localization and navigation, each encompassing numerous configurable components (e.g., selecting different planning algorithms). Once an algorithm has been selected for a component, its associated configuration options must be set to the appropriate values. Configuration options across the system stack interact non-trivially. Finding optimal configurations for highly configurable robots to achieve desired performance poses a significant challenge due to the interactions between configuration options across software and hardware that result in an exponentially large and complex configuration space. These challenges are further compounded by the need for transferability between different environments and robotic platforms. Data efficient optimization algorithms (e.g., Bayesian optimization) have been increasingly employed to automate the tuning of configurable parameters in cyber-physical systems. However, such optimization algorithms converge at later stages, often after exhausting the allocated budget (e.g., optimization steps, allotted time) and lacking transferability. This paper proposes CURE -- a method that identifies causally relevant configuration options, enabling the optimization process to operate in a reduced search space, thereby enabling faster optimization of robot performance. CURE abstracts the causal relationships between various configuration options and robot performance objectives by learning a causal model in the source (a low-cost environment such as the Gazebo simulator) and applying the learned knowledge to perform optimization in the target (e.g., Turtlebot 3 physical robot). We demonstrate the effectiveness and transferability of CURE by conducting experiments that involve varying degrees of deployment changes in both physical robots and simulation.

**ABSTRACT**  
We present FuncGrasp, a framework that can infer dense yet reliable grasp configurations for unseen objects using one annotated object and single-view RGB-D observation via categorical priors. Unlike previous works that only transfer a set of grasp poses, FuncGrasp aims to transfer infinite configurations parameterized by an object-centric continuous grasp function across varying instances. To ease the transfer process, we propose Neural Surface Grasping Fields (NSGF), an effective neural representation defined on the surface to densely encode grasp configurations. Further, we exploit function-to-function transfer using sphere primitives to establish semantically meaningful categorical correspondences, which are learned in an <b>unsupervised</b> fashion without any expert knowledge. We showcase the effectiveness through extensive experiments in both simulators and the real world. Remarkably, our framework significantly outperforms several strong baseline methods in terms of density and reliability for generated grasps.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recently, large language models (LLM) based <b>generative</b> <b>AI</b> has been gaining momentum for their impressive high-quality performances in multiple domains, particularly after the release of the ChatGPT. Many believe that they have the potential to perform general-purpose problem-solving in software development and replace human software developers. Nevertheless, there are in a lack of serious investigation into the capability of these <b>LLM</b> techniques in fulfilling software development tasks. In a controlled 2 $\times$ 2 between-subject experiment with 109 participants, we examined whether and to what degree working with <b>ChatGPT</b> was helpful in the coding task and typical software development task and how people work with ChatGPT. We found that while <b>ChatGPT</b> performed well in solving simple coding problems, its performance in supporting typical software development tasks was not that good. We also observed the interactions between participants and <b>ChatGPT</b> and found the relations between the interactions and the outcomes. Our study thus provides first-hand insights into using <b>ChatGPT</b> to fulfill software engineering tasks with real-world developers and motivates the need for novel interaction mechanisms that help developers effectively work with large language models to achieve desired outcomes.

**ABSTRACT**  
The increasing popularity of AI, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), has significantly impacted various domains, including Software Engineering. This study explores the integration of AI tools in software engineering practices within a large organization. We focus on ANZ Bank, which employs over 5000 engineers covering all aspects of the software development life cycle. This paper details an experiment conducted using GitHub Copilot, a notable AI tool, within a controlled environment to evaluate its effectiveness in real-world engineering tasks. Additionally, this paper shares initial findings on the productivity improvements observed after GitHub Copilot was adopted on a large scale, with about 1000 engineers using it. ANZ Bank's six-week experiment with GitHub Copilot included two weeks of preparation and four weeks of active testing. The study evaluated participant sentiment and the tool's impact on productivity, code quality, and security. Initially, participants used GitHub Copilot for proposed use-cases, with their feedback gathered through regular surveys. In the second phase, they were divided into Control and Copilot groups, each tackling the same Python challenges, and their experiences were again surveyed. Results showed a notable boost in productivity and code quality with GitHub Copilot, though its impact on code security remained inconclusive. Participant responses were overall positive, confirming GitHub Copilot's effectiveness in large-scale software engineering environments. Early data from 1000 engineers also indicated a significant increase in productivity and job satisfaction.

**ABSTRACT**  
Feature location attempts to assist developers in discovering functionality in source code. Many textual feature location techniques utilize <b>information</b> <b>retrieval</b> and rely on comments and identifiers of source code to describe software entities. An interesting alternative would be to employ the changeset descriptions of the code altered in that changeset as a data source to describe such software entities. To investigate this we implement a technique utilizing changeset descriptions and conduct an empirical study to observe this technique's overall performance. Moreover, we study how the granularity (i.e. file or method level of software entities) and changeset range inclusion (i.e. most recent or all historical changesets) affect such an approach. The results of a preliminary study with Rhino and Mylyn.Tasks systems suggest that the approach could lead to a potentially efficient feature location technique. They also suggest that it is advantageous in terms of the effort to configure the technique at method level granularity and that older changesets from older systems may reduce the effectiveness of the technique.

**ABSTRACT**  
Over the past few years, deep learning methods have been applied for a wide range of Software Engineering (SE) tasks, including in particular for the important task of automatically predicting and localizing faults in software. With the rapid adoption of increasingly complex machine learning models, it however becomes more and more difficult for scholars to reproduce the results that are reported in the literature. This is in particular the case when the applied deep learning models and the evaluation methodology are not properly documented and when code and data are not shared. Given some recent -- and very worrying -- findings regarding reproducibility and progress in other areas of applied machine learning, the goal of this work is to analyze to what extent the field of software engineering, in particular in the area of software fault prediction, is plagued by similar problems. We have therefore conducted a systematic review of the current literature and examined the level of reproducibility of 56 research articles that were published between 2019 and 2022 in top-tier software engineering conferences. Our analysis revealed that scholars are apparently largely aware of the reproducibility problem, and about two thirds of the papers provide code for their proposed deep learning models. However, it turned out that in the vast majority of cases, crucial elements for reproducibility are missing, such as the code of the compared baselines, code for data pre-processing or code for hyperparameter tuning. In these cases, it therefore remains challenging to exactly reproduce the results in the current research literature. Overall, our meta-analysis therefore calls for improved research practices to ensure the reproducibility of machine-learning based research.

**ABSTRACT**  
In the ever-expanding landscape of Artificial Intelligence (AI), where innovation thrives and new products and services are continuously being delivered, ensuring that AI systems are designed and developed responsibly throughout their entire lifecycle is crucial. To this end, several AI ethics principles and guidelines have been issued to which AI systems should conform. Nevertheless, relying solely on high-level AI ethics principles is far from sufficient to ensure the responsible engineering of AI systems. In this field, AI professionals often navigate by sight. Indeed, while recommendations promoting Trustworthy AI (TAI) exist, these are often high-level statements that are difficult to translate into concrete implementation strategies. There is a significant gap between high-level AI ethics principles and low-level concrete practices for AI professionals. To address this challenge, our work presents an experience report where we develop a novel holistic framework for Trustworthy AI - designed to bridge the gap between theory and practice - and report insights from its application in an industrial case study. The framework is built on the result of a systematic review of the state of the practice, a survey, and think-aloud interviews with 34 AI practitioners. The framework, unlike most of those already in the literature, is designed to provide actionable guidelines and tools to support different types of stakeholders throughout the entire Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Our goal is to empower AI professionals to confidently navigate the ethical dimensions of TAI through practical insights, ensuring that the vast potential of AI is exploited responsibly for the benefit of society as a whole.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this paper, we demonstrate for the first time how the Integrated Finite Element Neural Network (I-FENN) framework, previously proposed by the authors, can efficiently simulate the entire loading history of non-local gradient damage propagation. To achieve this goal, we first adopt a Temporal <b>Convolutional</b> <b>Network</b> (TCN) as the neural network of choice to capture the history-dependent evolution of the non-local strain in a coarsely meshed domain. The quality of the network predictions governs the computational performance of I-FENN, and therefore we perform an extended investigation aimed at enhancing them. We explore a data-driven vs. physics-informed TCN setup to arrive at an optimum network training, evaluating the network based on a coherent set of relevant performance metrics. We address the crucial issue of training a physics-informed network with input data that span vastly different length scales by proposing a systematic way of input normalization and output un-normalization. We then integrate the trained TCN within the nonlinear iterative FEM solver and apply I-FENN to simulate the damage propagation analysis. I-FENN is always applied in mesh idealizations different from the one used for the TCN training, showcasing the framework's ability to be used at progressively refined mesh resolutions. We illustrate several cases that I-FENN completes the <b>simulation</b> using either a modified or a full Newton-Raphson scheme, and we showcase its computational savings compared to both the classical monolithic and staggered FEM solvers. We underline that we satisfy very strict convergence criteria for every increment across the entire simulation, providing clear evidence of the robustness and accuracy of I-FENN. All the code and data used in this work will be made publicly available upon publication of the article.

**ABSTRACT**  
Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) gyroscopes are widely used in consumer and automotive applications. They have to fulfill a vast number of product requirements which lead to complex mechanical designs of the resonating structure. Arriving at a final design is a cumbersome process that relies heavily on human experience in conjunction with design optimization methods. In this work, we apply node-based shape optimization to the design of a MEMS gyroscope. For that purpose, we parametrize the coordinates of the nodes of the finite element method (FEM) mesh that discretize the shapes of the springs. We then implement the gradients of the mechanical eigenfrequencies and typical MEMS manufacturability constraints, with respect to the design parameters, in a FEM code. Using gradient-based optimization we tune the gyroscope's frequency split and shift spurious modes away from the first three multiples of the gyroscope's drive frequency while manufacturability constraints are fulfilled. The resulting optimized design exhibits novel geometrical shapes which defy any human intuition. Overall, we demonstrate that shape optimization can not only solve optimization problems in MEMS design without required human intervention, but also explores geometry solutions which can otherwise not be addressed. In this way, node-based shape optimization opens up a much larger space of possible design solutions, which is crucial for facing the ever increasing product requirements. Our approach is generic and applicable to many other types of MEMS resonators.

**ABSTRACT**  
Introduction This study explores the use of the latest You Only Look Once (YOLO V7) <b>object</b> <b>detection</b> method to enhance kidney detection in medical imaging by training and testing a modified YOLO V7 on medical image formats. Methods Study includes 878 patients with various subtypes of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and 206 patients with normal kidneys. A total of 5657 MRI scans for 1084 patients were retrieved. 326 patients with 1034 tumors recruited from a retrospective maintained database, and bounding boxes were drawn around their tumors. A primary model was trained on 80% of annotated cases, with 20% saved for testing (primary test set). The best primary model was then used to identify tumors in the remaining 861 patients and bounding box coordinates were generated on their scans using the model. Ten benchmark training sets were created with generated coordinates on not-segmented patients. The final model used to predict the kidney in the primary test set. We reported the positive predictive value (PPV), sensitivity, and mean average precision (mAP). Results The primary training set showed an average PPV of 0.94 +/- 0.01, sensitivity of 0.87 +/- 0.04, and mAP of 0.91 +/- 0.02. The best primary model yielded a PPV of 0.97, sensitivity of 0.92, and mAP of 0.95. The final model demonstrated an average PPV of 0.95 +/- 0.03, sensitivity of 0.98 +/- 0.004, and mAP of 0.95 +/- 0.01. Conclusion Using a semi-supervised approach with a medical image library, we developed a high-performing model for kidney detection. Further external validation is required to assess the model's generalizability.

**ABSTRACT**  
End-to-End (E2E) unrolled optimization frameworks show promise for Magnetic Resonance (MR) image recovery, but suffer from high memory usage during training. In addition, these deterministic approaches do not offer opportunities for sampling from the posterior distribution. In this paper, we introduce a memory-efficient approach for E2E learning of the posterior distribution. We represent this distribution as the combination of a data-consistency-induced likelihood term and an energy model for the prior, parameterized by a <b>Convolutional</b> <b>Neural</b> <b>Network</b> (CNN). The <b>CNN</b> weights are learned from training data in an E2E fashion using maximum likelihood optimization. The learned model enables the recovery of images from undersampled measurements using the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) optimization. In addition, the posterior model can be sampled to derive uncertainty maps about the reconstruction. Experiments on parallel MR image reconstruction show that our approach performs comparable to the memory-intensive E2E unrolled algorithm, performs better than its memory-efficient counterpart, and can provide uncertainty maps. Our framework paves the way towards MR image reconstruction in 3D and higher dimensions

**ABSTRACT**  
The histopathology analysis is of great significance for the diagnosis and prognosis of cancers, however, it has great challenges due to the enormous heterogeneity of gigapixel whole slide images (WSIs) and the intricate representation of pathological features. However, recent methods have not adequately exploited geometrical representation in WSIs which is significant in disease diagnosis. Therefore, we proposed a novel <b>weakly-supervised</b> framework, Geometry-Aware <b>Transformer</b> (GOAT), in which we urge the model to pay attention to the geometric characteristics within the tumor microenvironment which often serve as potent indicators. In addition, a context-aware attention mechanism is designed to extract and enhance the morphological features within WSIs.

**ABSTRACT**  
Noisy images are a challenge to image compression algorithms due to the inherent difficulty of compressing noise. As noise cannot easily be discerned from image details, such as high-frequency signals, its presence leads to extra bits needed for compression. Since the emerging learned image compression paradigm enables end-to-end optimization of codecs, recent efforts were made to integrate denoising into the compression model, relying on clean image features to guide denoising. However, these methods exhibit suboptimal performance under high noise levels, lacking the capability to generalize across diverse noise types. In this paper, we propose a novel method integrating a multi-scale denoiser comprising of Self Organizing Operational Neural Networks, for joint image compression and denoising. We employ <b>contrastive</b> <b>learning</b> to boost the network ability to differentiate noise from high frequency signal components, by emphasizing the correlation between noisy and clean counterparts. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method both in rate-distortion performance, and codec speed, outperforming the current state-of-the-art.

**ABSTRACT**  
We consider communication over the Gaussian multiple-access channel in the regime where the number of users grows linearly with the codelength. We investigate coded CDMA schemes where each user's information is encoded via a linear code before being modulated with a signature sequence. We propose an efficient approximate message passing (AMP) decoder that can be tailored to the structure of the linear code, and provide an exact asymptotic characterization of its performance. Based on this result, we consider a decoder that integrates AMP and belief propagation and characterize the tradeoff between spectral efficiency and signal-to-noise ratio, for a given target error rate. <b>Simulation</b> results are provided to demonstrate the benefits of the concatenated scheme at finite lengths.

**ABSTRACT**  
We leverage the Multiplicative Weight Update (MWU) method to develop a decentralized algorithm that significantly improves the performance of dynamic time division duplexing (D-TDD) in small cell networks. The proposed algorithm adaptively adjusts the time portion allocated to uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) transmissions at every node during each scheduled time slot, aligning the packet transmissions toward the most appropriate link directions according to the feedback of signal-to-interference ratio information. Our <b>simulation</b> results reveal that compared to the (conventional) fixed configuration of UL/DL transmission probabilities in D-TDD, incorporating MWU into D-TDD brings about a two-fold improvement of mean packet throughput in the DL and a three-fold improvement of the same performance metric in the UL, resulting in the D-TDD even outperforming Static-TDD in the UL. It also shows that the proposed scheme maintains a consistent performance gain in the presence of an ascending traffic load, validating its effectiveness in boosting the network performance. This work also demonstrates an approach that accounts for algorithmic considerations at the forefront when solving stochastic problems.

**ABSTRACT**  
This letter considers a two-panel massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication system, where the base station (BS) is equipped with two antenna panels that may use different frequency bands for communication. By exploiting the geometric relationships between antenna panels, efficient channel inference methods across antenna panels are proposed to reduce the overhead of real-time channel estimation. Four scenarios are considered, namely far-field free-space, near-field free-space, multi-path sharing far-field scatterers, and multi-path sharing near-field scatterers. For both far-field and near-field free-space scenarios, we show that the channel of one panel can be fully inferred from that of the other panel, as long as the multi-path components (MPCs) composing the channel can be resolved. On the other hand, for the multi-path scenarios sharing far-field or near-field scatterers, only the angles or range of angles of the MPCs can be inferred, respectively. <b>Simulation</b> results based on commercial 3D ray-tracing software are presented to validate our developed channel inference techniques.

**ABSTRACT**  
Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is a key technology to control the communication environment in future wireless networks. Recently, beyond diagonal RIS (BD-RIS) emerged as a generalization of RIS achieving larger coverage through additional tunable impedance components interconnecting the RIS elements. However, conventional RIS and BD-RIS can effectively serve only users in their proximity, resulting in limited coverage. To overcome this limitation, in this paper, we investigate distributed RIS, whose elements are distributed over a wide region, in opposition to localized RIS commonly considered in the literature. The scaling laws of distributed BD-RIS reveal that it offers significant gains over distributed conventional RIS and localized BD-RIS, enabled by its interconnections allowing signal propagation within the BD-RIS. To assess the practical performance of distributed BD-RIS, we model and optimize BD-RIS with lossy interconnections through transmission line theory. Our model accounts for phase changes and losses over the BD-RIS interconnections arising when the interconnection lengths are not much smaller than the wavelength. Numerical results show that the performance of localized BD-RIS is only slightly impacted by losses, given the short interconnection lengths. Besides, distributed BD-RIS can achieve orders of magnitude of gains over conventional RIS, even in the presence of low losses.

**ABSTRACT**  
The use of deep learning has become increasingly popular in reduced-order models (ROMs) to obtain low-dimensional representations of full-order models. Convolutional autoencoders (CAEs) are often used to this end as they are adept at handling data that are spatially distributed, including solutions to partial differential equations. When applied to unsteady physics problems, ROMs also require a model for time-series prediction of the low-dimensional latent variables. Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, a type of <b>recurrent</b> <b>neural</b> <b>network</b> useful for modeling sequential data, are frequently employed in data-driven ROMs for autoregressive time-series prediction. When making predictions at unseen design points over long time horizons, error propagation is a frequently encountered issue, where errors made early on can compound over time and lead to large inaccuracies. In this work, we propose using bagging, a commonly used ensemble learning technique, to develop a fully data-driven ROM framework referred to as the CAE-eLSTM ROM that uses CAEs for spatial reconstruction of the full-order model and LSTM ensembles for time-series prediction. When applied to two unsteady fluid dynamics problems, our results show that the presented framework effectively reduces error propagation and leads to more accurate time-series prediction of latent variables at unseen points.

**ABSTRACT**  
This work proposes a cooperative strategy that employs deviated pursuit guidance to simultaneously intercept a moving (but not manoeuvring) target. As opposed to many existing cooperative guidance strategies which use estimates of time-to-go, based on proportional-navigation guidance, the proposed strategy uses an exact expression for time-to-go to ensure simultaneous interception. The guidance design considers nonlinear engagement kinematics, allowing the proposed strategy to remain effective over a large operating regime. Unlike existing strategies on simultaneous interception that achieve interception at the average value of their initial time-to-go estimates, this work provides flexibility in the choice of impact time. By judiciously choosing the edge weights of the communication network, a weighted consensus in time-to-go can be achieved. It has been shown that by allowing an edge weight to be negative, consensus in time-to-go can even be achieved for an impact time that lies outside the convex hull of the set of initial time-to-go values of the individual interceptors. The bounds on such negative weights have been analysed for some special graphs, using Nyquist criterion. Simulations are provided to vindicate the efficacy of the proposed strategy.

**ABSTRACT**  
In underwater navigation, accurate heading information is crucial for accurately and continuously tracking trajectories, especially during extended missions beneath the waves. In order to determine the initial heading, a gyrocompassing procedure must be employed. As unmanned underwater vehicles (UUV) are susceptible to ocean currents and other disturbances, the model-based gyrocompassing procedure may experience degraded performance. To cope with such situations, this paper introduces a dedicated learning framework aimed at mitigating environmental effects and offering precise underwater gyrocompassing. Through the analysis of the dynamic UUV signature obtained from inertial measurements, our proposed framework learns to refine disturbed signals, enabling a focused examination of the earth's rotation rate vector. Leveraging recent machine learning advancements, empirical simulations assess the framework's adaptability to challenging underwater conditions. Ultimately, its contribution lies in providing a resilient gyrocompassing solution for UUVs.

**ABSTRACT**  
The encounter situation between marine vessels determines how they should navigate to obey COLREGs, but time-varying and stochastic uncertainty in estimation of angles of encounter, and of closest point of approach, easily give rise to different assessment of situation at two approaching vessels. This may lead to high-risk conditions and could cause collision. This article considers decision making under uncertainty and suggests a novel method for probabilistic interpretation of vessel encounters that is explainable and provides a measure of uncertainty in the evaluation. The method is equally useful for decision support on a manned bridge as on Marine Autonomous Surface Ships (MASS) where it provides input for automated navigation. The method makes formal safety assessment and validation feasible. We obtain a resilient algorithm for machine interpretation of COLREGs under uncertainty and show its efficacy by simulations.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper presents a circuit for precise vertical landing of drones based on a three phase-shifts detection of a single frequency transmitted from the landing point. The circuit can be considered as a new navigation sensor that assists in guidance corrections for landing at a specific point. The circuit has three inputs to which the signal transmitted from an oscillator located at the landing point arrives with different delays. The input signals are combined in pairs in each of the three analog phase detectors, after having passed through 3 dB@90 o hybrid couplers that guarantee a theoretical non-ambiguous phase-shift range of +-90 degree. Each output has a voltage that is proportional to the phase-shift between each of the input signals, which in turn depend on the position relative to the landing point. A simple landing algorithm based on phase-shift values is proposed, which could be integrated into the same flight control platform, thus avoiding the need to add additional processing components. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed design, a triangular <b>phase-shift</b> <b>detector</b> prototype has been implemented using commercial devices. Calibration and measurements at 2.46 GHz show a dynamic range of 30 dB and a non-ambiguous detection range of +-80 degree in the worst cases. Those specs let us to track the drone during the landing maneuver in an inverted cone formed by a surface with a +-4.19 m radius at 10m high and the landing point.

**ABSTRACT**  
Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) exhibit promising enhancements in coverage and data rates for wireless communication systems, particularly in the context of 5G and beyond. This paper introduces a novel approach by focusing on the design and prototyping of a transmissive RIS, contrasting with existing research predominantly centered on reflective RIS. The achievement of 1-bit transmissive RIS through the antisymmetry configuration of the two PIN diodes, nearly uniform transmission magnitudes but inversed phase states in a wide band can be obtained. A transmissive RIS prototype consisting of 16 $\times$ 16 elements is meticulously designed, fabricated, and subjected to measurement to validate the proposed design. The results demonstrate that the proposed RIS unit cell achieves effective 1-bit phase tuning with minimal insertion loss and a transmission bandwidth of 3 dB exceeding $20\%$ at 5.8GHz. By dynamically modulating the quantized code distributions on the RIS, it becomes possible to construct scanning beams. The experimental outcomes of the RIS-assisted communication system validate that, in comparison to scenarios without RIS, the signal receiving power experiences an increase of approximately 7dB when RIS is deployed to overcome obstacles. This underscores the potential applicability of mobile RIS in practical communication.

**ABSTRACT**  
The integrated community energy system (ICES) has emerged as a promising solution for enhancing the efficiency of the distribution system by effectively coordinating multiple energy sources. However, the operational optimization of ICES is hindered by the physical constraints of heterogeneous networks including electricity, natural gas, and heat. These challenges are difficult to address due to the non-linearity of network constraints and the high complexity of multi-network coordination. This paper, therefore, proposes a novel Safe <b>Reinforcement</b> <b>Learning</b> (SRL) algorithm to optimize the multi-network constrained operation problem of ICES. Firstly, a comprehensive ICES model is established considering integrated demand response (IDR), multiple energy devices, and network constraints. The multi-network operational optimization problem of ICES is then presented and reformulated as a constrained Markov Decision Process (C-MDP) accounting for violating physical network constraints. The proposed novel SRL algorithm, named Primal-Dual Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (PD-TD3), solves the C-MDP by employing a Lagrangian multiplier to penalize the multi-network constraint violation, ensuring that violations are within a tolerated range and avoid over-conservative strategy with a low reward at the same time. The proposed algorithm accurately estimates the cumulative reward and cost of the training process, thus achieving a fair balance between improving profits and reducing constraint violations in a privacy-protected environment with only partial information. A case study comparing the proposed algorithm with benchmark RL algorithms demonstrates the computational performance in increasing total profits and alleviating the network constraint violations.

**ABSTRACT**  
Online discussion platforms are a vital part of the public discourse in a deliberative democracy. However, how to interpret the outcomes of the discussions on these platforms is often unclear. In this paper, we propose a novel and explainable method for selecting a set of most representative, consistent points of view by combining methods from computational social choice and abstract argumentation. Specifically, we model online discussions as abstract argumentation frameworks combined with information regarding which arguments voters approve of. Based on ideas from approval-based multiwinner voting, we introduce several voting rules for selecting a set of preferred extensions that represents voters' points of view. We compare the proposed methods across several dimensions, theoretically and in numerical simulations, and give clear suggestions on which methods to use depending on the specific situation.

**ABSTRACT**  
Mean-field <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning</b> has become a popular theoretical framework for efficiently approximating large-scale multi-agent <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning</b> (MARL) problems exhibiting symmetry. However, questions remain regarding the applicability of mean-field approximations: in particular, their approximation accuracy of real-world systems and conditions under which they become computationally tractable. We establish explicit finite-agent bounds for how well the MFG solution approximates the true $N$-player game for two popular mean-field solution concepts. Furthermore, for the first time, we establish explicit lower bounds indicating that MFGs are poor or uninformative at approximating $N$-player games assuming only Lipschitz dynamics and rewards. Finally, we analyze the computational complexity of solving MFGs with only Lipschitz properties and prove that they are in the class of \textsc{PPAD}-complete problems conjectured to be intractable, similar to general sum $N$ player games. Our theoretical results underscore the limitations of MFGs and complement and justify existing work by proving difficulty in the absence of common theoretical assumptions.

**ABSTRACT**  
TikTok is one of the largest and fastest-growing social media sites in the world. TikTok features, however, such as voice transcripts, are often missing and other important features, such as <b>OCR</b> or video descriptions, do not exist. We introduce the <b>Generative</b> <b>AI</b> Enriched TikTok (GET-Tok) data, a pipeline for collecting TikTok videos and enriched data by augmenting the TikTok Research API with <b>generative</b> <b>AI</b> models. As a case study, we collect videos about the attempted coup in Peru initiated by its former President, Pedro Castillo, and its accompanying protests. The data includes information on 43,697 videos published from November 20, 2022 to March 1, 2023 (102 days). <b>Generative</b> <b>AI</b> augments the collected data via transcripts of TikTok videos, text descriptions of what is shown in the videos, what text is displayed within the video, and the stances expressed in the video. Overall, this pipeline will contribute to a better understanding of online discussion in a multimodal setting with applications of Generative AI, especially outlining the utility of this pipeline in non-English-language social media. Our code used to produce the pipeline is in a public Github repository: https://github.com/gabbypinto/GET-Tok-Peru.

**ABSTRACT**  
We study the problem of Bayesian fixed-budget best-arm identification (BAI) in structured bandits. We propose an algorithm that uses fixed allocations based on the prior information and the structure of the environment. We provide theoretical bounds on its performance across diverse models, including the first prior-dependent upper bounds for linear and hierarchical BAI. Our key contribution is introducing new proof methods that result in tighter bounds for multi-armed BAI compared to existing methods. We extensively compare our approach to other fixed-budget BAI methods, demonstrating its consistent and robust performance in various settings. Our work improves our understanding of Bayesian fixed-budget BAI in structured bandits and highlights the effectiveness of our approach in practical scenarios.

**ABSTRACT**  
Transformers have achieved state-of-the-art performance in language modeling tasks. However, the reasons behind their tremendous success are still unclear. In this paper, towards a better understanding, we train a <b>Transformer</b> model on a simple next token prediction task, where sequences are generated as a first-order autoregressive process $s_{t+1} = W s_t$. We show how a trained <b>Transformer</b> predicts the next token by first learning $W$ in-context, then applying a prediction mapping. We call the resulting procedure <b>in-context</b> autoregressive learning. More precisely, focusing on commuting orthogonal matrices $W$, we first show that a trained one-layer linear <b>Transformer</b> implements one step of gradient descent for the minimization of an inner objective function, when considering augmented tokens. When the tokens are not augmented, we characterize the global minima of a one-layer diagonal linear multi-head Transformer. Importantly, we exhibit orthogonality between heads and show that positional encoding captures trigonometric relations in the data. On the experimental side, we consider the general case of non-commuting orthogonal matrices and generalize our theoretical findings.

**ABSTRACT**  
Information theoretic quantities play a central role in machine learning. The recent surge in the complexity of data and models has increased the demand for accurate estimation of these quantities. However, as the dimension grows the estimation presents significant challenges, with existing methods struggling already in relatively low dimensions. To address this issue, in this work, we introduce $\texttt{REMEDI}$ for efficient and accurate estimation of differential entropy, a fundamental information theoretic quantity. The approach combines the minimization of the cross-entropy for simple, adaptive base models and the estimation of their deviation, in terms of the relative entropy, from the data density. Our approach demonstrates improvement across a broad spectrum of estimation tasks, encompassing entropy estimation on both synthetic and natural data. Further, we extend important theoretical consistency results to a more generalized setting required by our approach. We illustrate how the framework can be naturally extended to information theoretic <b>supervised</b> <b>learning</b> models, with a specific focus on the Information Bottleneck approach. It is demonstrated that the method delivers better accuracy compared to the existing methods in Information Bottleneck. In addition, we explore a natural connection between $\texttt{REMEDI}$ and generative modeling using rejection sampling and Langevin dynamics.

**ABSTRACT**  
This work investigates <b>adversarial</b> <b>training</b> in the context of margin-based linear classifiers in the high-dimensional regime where the dimension $d$ and the number of data points $n$ diverge with a fixed ratio $\alpha = n / d$. We introduce a tractable mathematical model where the interplay between the data and adversarial attacker geometries can be studied, while capturing the core phenomenology observed in the adversarial robustness literature. Our main theoretical contribution is an exact asymptotic description of the sufficient statistics for the adversarial empirical risk minimiser, under generic convex and non-increasing losses. Our result allow us to precisely characterise which directions in the data are associated with a higher generalisation/robustness trade-off, as defined by a robustness and a usefulness metric. In particular, we unveil the existence of directions which can be defended without penalising accuracy. Finally, we show the advantage of defending non-robust features during training, identifying a uniform protection as an inherently effective defence mechanism.

**ABSTRACT**  
An open scientific challenge is how to classify events with reliable measures of uncertainty, when we have a mechanistic model of the data-generating process but the distribution over both labels and latent nuisance parameters is different between train and target data. We refer to this type of distributional shift as generalized label shift (GLS). Direct classification using observed data $\mathbf{X}$ as covariates leads to biased predictions and invalid uncertainty estimates of labels $Y$. We overcome these biases by proposing a new method for robust uncertainty quantification that casts classification as a hypothesis testing problem under nuisance parameters. The key idea is to estimate the classifier's receiver operating characteristic (ROC) across the entire nuisance parameter space, which allows us to devise cutoffs that are invariant under GLS. Our method effectively endows a pre-trained classifier with <b>domain</b> <b>adaptation</b> capabilities and returns valid prediction sets while maintaining high power. We demonstrate its performance on two challenging scientific problems in biology and astroparticle physics with data from realistic mechanistic models.

**ABSTRACT**  
The integration of physiological computing into mixed-initiative human-robot interaction systems offers valuable advantages in autonomous task allocation by incorporating real-time features as human state observations into the decision-making system. This approach may alleviate the cognitive load on human operators by intelligently allocating mission tasks between agents. Nevertheless, accommodating a diverse pool of human participants with varying physiological and behavioral measurements presents a substantial challenge. To address this, resorting to a probabilistic framework becomes necessary, given the inherent uncertainty and partial observability on the human's state. Recent research suggests to learn a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) model from a data set of previously collected experiences that can be solved using <b>Offline</b> <b>Reinforcement</b> <b>Learning</b> (ORL) methods. In the present work, we not only highlight the potential of partially observable representations and physiological measurements to improve human operator state estimation and performance, but also enhance the overall mission effectiveness of a human-robot team. Importantly, as the fixed data set may not contain enough information to fully represent complex stochastic processes, we propose a method to incorporate model uncertainty, thus enabling risk-sensitive sequential decision-making. Experiments were conducted with a group of twenty-six human participants within a simulated robot teleoperation environment, yielding empirical evidence of the method's efficacy. The obtained adaptive task allocation policy led to statistically significant higher scores than the one that was used to collect the data set, allowing for generalization across diverse participants also taking into account risk-sensitive metrics.

**ABSTRACT**  
Various robots, rovers, drones, and other agents of mass-produced products are expected to encounter scenes where they intersect and collaborate in the near future. In such multi-agent systems, individual identification and communication play crucial roles. In this paper, we explore camera-based visible light communication using event cameras to tackle this problem. An event camera captures the events occurring in regions with changes in brightness and can be utilized as a receiver for visible light communication, leveraging its high temporal resolution. Generally, agents with identical appearances in mass-produced products are visually indistinguishable when using conventional CMOS cameras. Therefore, linking visual information with information acquired through conventional radio communication is challenging. We empirically demonstrate the advantages of a visible light communication system employing event cameras and LEDs for visual individual identification over conventional CMOS cameras with ArUco marker recognition. In the simulation, we also verified scenarios where our event camera-based visible light communication outperforms conventional radio communication in situations with visually indistinguishable multi-agents. Finally, our newly implemented multi-agent system verifies its functionality through physical robot experiments.

**ABSTRACT**  
We theoretically evaluated the performance of our proposed associative watermarking method in which the watermark is not embedded directly into the image. We previously proposed a watermarking method that extends the zero-watermarking model by applying associative memory models. In this model, the hetero-associative memory model is introduced to the mapping process between image features and watermarks, and the auto-associative memory model is applied to correct watermark errors. We herein show that the associative watermarking model outperforms the zero-watermarking model through computer simulations using actual images. In this paper, we describe how we derive the macroscopic state equation for the associative watermarking model using the Okada theory. The theoretical results obtained by the fourth-order theory were in good agreement with those obtained by computer simulations. Furthermore, the performance of the associative watermarking model was evaluated using the bit error rate of the watermark, both theoretically and using computer simulations.

**ABSTRACT**  
This study proposes a method based on fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs) to identify migratory birds from their songs, with the objective of recognizing which birds pass through certain areas and at what time. To determine the best FCN architecture, extensive experimentation was conducted through a grid search, exploring the optimal depth, width, and activation function of the network. The results showed that the optimal number of filters is 400 in the widest layer, with 4 convolutional blocks with maxpooling and an adaptive activation function. The proposed FCN offers a significant advantage over other techniques, as it can recognize the sound of a bird in audio of any length with an accuracy greater than 85%. Furthermore, due to its architecture, the network can detect more than one species from audio and can carry out near-real-time sound recognition. Additionally, the proposed method is lightweight, making it ideal for deployment and use in IoT devices. The study also presents a comparative analysis of the proposed method against other techniques, demonstrating an improvement of over 67% in the best-case scenario. These findings contribute to advancing the field of bird sound recognition and provide valuable insights into the practical application of FCNs in real-world scenarios.

**ABSTRACT**  
The Discrete Event System Specification formalism (DEVS), which supports hierarchical and modular model composition, has been widely used to understand, analyze and develop a variety of systems. DEVS has been implemented in various languages and platforms over the years. The DEVStone benchmark was conceived to generate a set of models with varied structure and behavior, and to automate the evaluation of the performance of DEVS-based simulators. However, DEVStone is still in a preliminar phase and more model analysis is required. In this paper, we revisit DEVStone introducing new equations to compute the number of events triggered. We also introduce a new benchmark, called HOmem, designed as an alternative version of HOmod, with similar CPU and memory requirements, but with an easier implementation and analytically more manageable. Finally, we compare both the performance and memory footprint of five different DEVS simulators in two different hardware platforms.

**ABSTRACT**  
Full-duplex (FD) technology is gaining popularity for integration into a wide range of wireless networks due to its demonstrated potential in recent studies. In contrast to half-duplex (HD) technology, the implementation of FD in networks necessitates considering inter-node interference (INI) from various network perspectives. When deploying FD technology in networks, several critical factors must be taken into account. These include self-interference (SI) and the requisite SI cancellation (SIC) processes, as well as the selection of multiple user equipment (UE) per time slot. Additionally, inter-node interference (INI), including cross-link interference (CLI) and inter-cell interference (ICI), become crucial issues during concurrent uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) transmission and reception, similar to SI. Since most INI is challenging to eliminate, a comprehensive investigation that covers radio resource control (RRC), medium access control (MAC), and the physical layer (PHY) is essential in the context of FD network design, rather than focusing on individual network layers and types. This paper covers state-of-the-art studies, including protocols and documents from 3GPP for FD, MAC protocol, user scheduling, and CLI handling. The methods are also compared through a network-level system <b>simulation</b> based on 3D ray-tracing.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recent advances in AI and intelligent vehicle technology hold promise to revolutionize mobility and transportation, in the form of advanced driving assistance (ADAS) interfaces. Although it is widely recognized that certain cognitive factors, such as impulsivity and inhibitory control, are related to risky driving behavior, play a significant role in on-road risk-taking, existing systems fail to leverage such factors. Varying levels of these cognitive factors could influence the effectiveness and acceptance of driver safety interfaces. We demonstrate an approach for personalizing driver interaction via driver safety interfaces that are triggered based on a learned recurrent neural network. The network is trained from a population of human drivers to infer impulsivity and inhibitory control from recent driving behavior. Using a high-fidelity vehicle motion simulator, we demonstrate the ability to deduce these factors from driver behavior. We then use these inferred factors to make instantaneous determinations on whether or not to engage a driver safety interface. This interface aims to decrease a driver's speed during yellow lights and reduce their inclination to run through them.

**ABSTRACT**  
Social media systems are as varied as they are pervasive. They have been almost universally adopted for a broad range of purposes including work, entertainment, activism, and decision making. As a result, they have also diversified, with many distinct designs differing in content type, organization, delivery mechanism, access control, and many other dimensions. In this work, we aim to characterize and then <b>distill</b> a concise design space of social media systems that can help us understand similarities and differences, recognize potential consequences of design choice, and identify spaces for innovation. Our model, which we call Form-From, characterizes social media based on (1) the form of the content, either threaded or flat, and (2) from where or from whom one might receive content, ranging from spaces to networks to the commons. We derive Form-From inductively from a larger set of 62 dimensions organized into 10 categories. To demonstrate the utility of our model, we trace the history of social media systems as they traverse the Form-From space over time, and we identify common design patterns within cells of the model.

**ABSTRACT**  
Discrete diffusion or flow models could enable faster and more controllable sequence generation than autoregressive models. We show that na\"ive linear flow matching on the simplex is insufficient toward this goal since it suffers from discontinuities in the training target and further pathologies. To overcome this, we develop Dirichlet flow matching on the simplex based on mixtures of Dirichlet distributions as probability paths. In this framework, we derive a connection between the mixtures' scores and the flow's vector field that allows for classifier and classifier-free guidance. Further, we provide distilled Dirichlet flow matching, which enables one-step sequence generation with minimal performance hits, resulting in $O(L)$ speedups compared to autoregressive models. On complex DNA sequence generation tasks, we demonstrate superior performance compared to all baselines in distributional metrics and in achieving desired design targets for generated sequences. Finally, we show that our classifier-free guidance approach improves unconditional generation and is effective for generating DNA that satisfies design targets. Code is available at https://github.com/HannesStark/dirichlet-flow-matching.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recent advances in <b>self-supervised</b> speech models have shown significant improvement in many downstream tasks. However, these models predominantly centered on frame-level training objectives, which can fall short in spoken language understanding tasks that require semantic comprehension. Existing works often rely on additional speech-text data as intermediate targets, which is costly in the real-world setting. To address this challenge, we propose Pseudo-Word HuBERT (PW-HuBERT), a framework that integrates pseudo word-level targets into the training process, where the targets are derived from a visually-ground speech model, notably eliminating the need for speech-text paired data. Our experimental results on four spoken language understanding (SLU) benchmarks suggest the superiority of our model in capturing semantic information.

**ABSTRACT**  
We propose a non-commutative algorithm for multiplying 2x2 matrices using 7 coefficient products. This algorithm reaches simultaneously a better accuracy in practice compared to previously known such fast algorithms, and a time complexity bound with the best currently known leading term (obtained via alternate basis sparsification). To build this algorithm, we consider matrix and tensor norms bounds governing the stability and accuracy of numerical matrix multiplication. First, we reduce those bounds by minimizing a growth factor along the unique orbit of Strassen's 2x2-matrix multiplication tensor decomposition. Second, we develop heuristics for minimizing the number of operations required to realize a given bilinear formula, while further improving its accuracy. Third, we perform an alternate basis sparsification that improves on the time complexity constant and mostly preserves the overall accuracy.

**ABSTRACT**  
We propose a new loss function for <b>supervised</b> and physics-informed training of neural networks and operators that incorporates a posteriori error estimate. More specifically, during the training stage, the neural network learns additional physical fields that lead to rigorous error majorants after a computationally cheap postprocessing stage. Theoretical results are based upon the theory of functional a posteriori error estimates, which allows for the systematic construction of such loss functions for a diverse class of practically relevant partial differential equations. From the numerical side, we demonstrate on a series of elliptic problems that for a variety of architectures and approaches (physics-informed neural networks, physics-informed neural operators, neural operators, and classical architectures in the regression and physics-informed settings), we can reach better or comparable accuracy and in addition to that cheaply recover high-quality upper bounds on the error after training.

**ABSTRACT**  
We propose a convenient matrix-free neural architecture for the multigrid method. The architecture is simple enough to be implemented in less than fifty lines of code, yet it encompasses a large number of distinct multigrid solvers. We argue that a fixed neural network without dense layers can not realize an efficient iterative method. Because of that, standard training protocols do not lead to competitive solvers. To overcome this difficulty, we use <b>parameter</b> <b>sharing</b> and serialization of layers. The resulting network can be trained on linear problems with thousands of unknowns and retains its efficiency on problems with millions of unknowns. From the point of view of numerical linear algebra network's training corresponds to finding optimal smoothers for the geometric multigrid method. We demonstrate our approach on a few second-order elliptic equations. For tested linear systems, we obtain from two to five times smaller spectral radius of the error propagation matrix compare to a basic linear multigrid with Jacobi smoother.

**ABSTRACT**  
Intra-fraction motion in radiotherapy is commonly modeled using deformable image registration (DIR). However, existing methods often struggle to balance speed and accuracy, limiting their applicability in clinical scenarios. This study introduces a novel approach that harnesses Neural Graphics Primitives (NGP) to optimize the displacement vector field (DVF). Our method leverages learned primitives, processed as splats, and interpolates within space using a shallow neural network. Uniquely, it enables <b>self-supervised</b> optimization at an ultra-fast speed, negating the need for pre-training on extensive datasets and allowing seamless adaptation to new cases. We validated this approach on the 4D-CT lung dataset DIR-lab, achieving a target registration error (TRE) of 1.15\pm1.15 mm within a remarkable time of 1.77 seconds. Notably, our method also addresses the sliding boundary problem, a common challenge in conventional DIR methods.

**ABSTRACT**  
The graph invariant EPT-sum has cropped up in several unrelated fields in later years: As an objective function for hierarchical clustering, as a more fine-grained version of the classical edge ranking problem, and, specifically when the input is a vertex-weighted tree, as a measure of average/expected search length in a partially ordered set. The EPT-sum of a graph $G$ is defined as the minimum sum of the depth of every leaf in an edge partition tree (EPT), a rooted tree where leaves correspond to vertices in $G$ and internal nodes correspond to edges in $G$. A simple algorithm that approximates EPT-sum on trees is given by recursively choosing the most balanced edge in the input tree $G$ to build an EPT of $G$. Due to its fast runtime, this balanced cut algorithm is used in practice. In this paper, we show that the balanced cut algorithm gives a 1.5-approximation of EPT-sum on trees, which amounts to a tight analysis and answers a question posed by Cicalese et al. in 2014.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this chapter we illustrate the use of some Machine Learning techniques in the context of omics data. More precisely, we review and evaluate the use of Random Forest and Penalized Multinomial <b>Logistic</b> <b>Regression</b> for integrative analysis of genomics and immunomics in pancreatic cancer. Furthermore, we propose the use of association rules with predictive purposes to overcome the low predictive power of the previously mentioned models. Finally, we apply the reviewed methods to a real data set from TCGA made of 107 tumoral pancreatic samples and 117,486 germline SNPs, showing the good performance of the proposed methods to predict the immunological infiltration in pancreatic cancer.

**ABSTRACT**  
Purpose: Assess whether <b>ChatGPT</b> 4.0 is accurate enough to perform research evaluations on journal articles to automate this time-consuming task. Design/methodology/approach: Test the extent to which ChatGPT-4 can assess the quality of journal articles using a case study of the published scoring guidelines of the UK Research Excellence Framework (REF) 2021 to create a research evaluation ChatGPT. This was applied to 51 of my own articles and compared against my own quality judgements. Findings: ChatGPT-4 can produce plausible document summaries and quality evaluation rationales that match the REF criteria. Its overall scores have weak correlations with my self-evaluation scores of the same documents (averaging r=0.281 over 15 iterations, with 8 being statistically significantly different from 0). In contrast, the average scores from the 15 iterations produced a statistically significant positive correlation of 0.509. Thus, averaging scores from multiple ChatGPT-4 rounds seems more effective than individual scores. The positive correlation may be due to <b>ChatGPT</b> being able to extract the author's significance, rigour, and originality claims from inside each paper. If my weakest articles are removed, then the correlation with average scores (r=0.200) falls below statistical significance, suggesting that <b>ChatGPT</b> struggles to make fine-grained evaluations. Research limitations: The data is self-evaluations of a convenience sample of articles from one academic in one field. Practical implications: Overall, <b>ChatGPT</b> does not yet seem to be accurate enough to be trusted for any formal or informal research quality evaluation tasks. Research evaluators, including journal editors, should therefore take steps to control its use. Originality/value: This is the first published attempt at post-publication expert review accuracy testing for ChatGPT.
