**ABSTRACT**  
When <b>LLMs</b> perform <b>zero-shot</b> inference, they typically use a <b>prompt</b> with a task specification, and generate a completion. However, there is no work to explore the possibility of the reverse - going from completion to task specification. In this paper, we employ both directions to perform cycle-supervised learning entirely <b>in-context.</b> Our goal is to create a forward map f : X -> Y (e.g. image -> generated caption), coupled with a backward map g : Y -> X (e.g. caption -> generated image) to construct a cycle-consistency "loss" (formulated as an update to the <b>prompt)</b> to enforce g(f(X)) ~= X. The technique, called CyclePrompt, uses cycle-consistency as a free supervisory signal to iteratively craft the <b>prompt.</b> Importantly, CyclePrompt reinforces model performance without expensive <b>fine-tuning,</b> without training data, and without the complexity of external environments (e.g. compilers, APIs). We demonstrate CyclePrompt in two domains: <b>code</b> <b>generation</b> and image captioning. Our results on the HumanEval coding <b>benchmark</b> put us in first place on the leaderboard among models that do not rely on extra training data or usage of external environments, and third overall. Compared to the <b>GPT4</b> baseline, we improve accuracy from 80.5% to 87.2%. In the <b>vision-language</b> space, we generate detailed image captions which outperform baseline <b>zero-shot</b> GPT4V captions, when tested against natural (VQAv2) and diagrammatic (FigureQA) <b>visual</b> <b>question-answering</b> <b>benchmarks.</b> To the best of our knowledge, this is the first use of <b>self-supervised</b> <b>learning</b> for <b>prompting.</b>

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Large</b> <b>Language</b> <b>Models</b> <b>(LLMs)</b> are increasingly being utilized by both candidates and employers in the recruitment context. However, with this comes numerous ethical concerns, particularly related to the lack of transparency in these "black-box" models. Although previous studies have sought to increase the transparency of these models by investigating the personality traits of <b>LLMs,</b> many of the previous studies have provided them with personality assessments to complete. On the other hand, this study seeks to obtain a better understanding of such models by examining their output variations based on different input <b>prompts.</b> Specifically, we use a novel elicitation approach using <b>prompts</b> derived from common interview questions, as well as <b>prompts</b> designed to elicit particular Big Five personality traits to examine whether the models were susceptible to trait-activation like humans are, to measure their personality based on the language used in their outputs. To do so, we repeatedly <b>prompted</b> multiple LMs with different parameter sizes, including <b>Llama-2,</b> <b>Falcon,</b> <b>Mistral,</b> <b>Bloom,</b> <b>GPT,</b> OPT, and <b>XLNet</b> (base and fine tuned versions) and examined their personality using classifiers trained on the myPersonality dataset. Our results reveal that, generally, all <b>LLMs</b> demonstrate high openness and low extraversion. However, whereas LMs with fewer parameters exhibit similar behaviour in personality traits, newer and LMs with more parameters exhibit a broader range of personality traits, with increased agreeableness, emotional stability, and openness. Furthermore, a greater number of parameters is positively associated with openness and conscientiousness. Moreover, <b>fine-tuned</b> models exhibit minor modulations in their personality traits, contingent on the dataset. Implications and directions for future research are discussed.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Unsupervised</b> <b>learning</b> objectives like language modeling and de-noising constitute a significant part in producing pre-trained models that perform various downstream applications from <b>natural</b> <b>language</b> <b>understanding</b> to conversational tasks. However, despite impressive conversational capabilities of recent <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>model,</b> their abilities to capture syntactic or semantic structure within text lag behind. We hypothesize that the mismatch between linguistic performance and competence in machines is attributable to insufficient transfer of linguistic structure knowledge to computational systems with currently popular pre-training objectives. We show that punctuation restoration transfers to improvements in in- and <b>out-of-distribution</b> performance on structure-related tasks like <b>named</b> <b>entity</b> <b>recognition,</b> <b>open</b> <b>information</b> <b>extraction,</b> chunking, and part-of-speech tagging. Punctuation restoration is an effective learning objective that can improve structure understanding and yield a more robust structure-aware representations of natural language.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Prompt</b> optimization aims to find the best <b>prompt</b> to a <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>model</b> <b>(LLM)</b> for a given task. <b>LLMs</b> have been successfully used to help find and improve <b>prompt</b> candidates for single-step tasks. However, realistic tasks for agents are multi-step and introduce new challenges: (1) <b>Prompt</b> content is likely to be more extensive and complex, making it more difficult for <b>LLMs</b> to analyze errors, (2) the impact of an individual step is difficult to evaluate, and (3) different people may have varied preferences about task execution. While humans struggle to optimize <b>prompts,</b> they are good at providing feedback about <b>LLM</b> outputs; we therefore introduce a new <b>LLM-driven</b> discrete <b>prompt</b> optimization framework that incorporates human-designed feedback rules about potential errors to automatically offer direct suggestions for improvement. Our framework is stylized as a genetic algorithm in which an <b>LLM</b> generates new candidate <b>prompts</b> from a parent <b>prompt</b> and its associated feedback; we use a learned heuristic function that predicts <b>prompt</b> performance to efficiently sample from these candidates. This approach significantly outperforms both human-engineered <b>prompts</b> and several other <b>prompt</b> optimization methods across eight representative multi-step tasks (an average 27.7% and 28.2% improvement to current best methods on <b>GPT-3.5</b> and <b>GPT-4,</b> respectively). We further show that the score function for tasks can be modified to better align with individual preferences. We believe our work can serve as a <b>benchmark</b> for automatic <b>prompt</b> optimization for <b>LLM-driven</b> multi-step tasks. Datasets and Codes are available at https://github.com/yongchao98/PROMST. Project Page is available at https://yongchao98.github.io/MIT-REALM-PROMST.

**ABSTRACT**  
Advances towards more faithful and traceable answers of <b>Large</b> <b>Language</b> <b>Models</b> <b>(LLMs)</b> are crucial for various research and practical endeavors. One avenue in reaching this goal is basing the answers on reliable sources. However, this Evidence-Based <b>QA</b> has proven to work insufficiently with <b>LLMs</b> in terms of citing the correct sources (source quality) and truthfully representing the information within sources (answer attributability). In this work, we systematically investigate how to robustly <b>fine-tune</b> <b>LLMs</b> for better source quality and answer attributability. Specifically, we introduce a data generation pipeline with automated data quality filters, which can synthesize diversified high-quality training and testing data at scale. We further introduce four test sets to <b>benchmark</b> the robustness of <b>fine-tuned</b> specialist models. Extensive evaluation shows that <b>fine-tuning</b> on synthetic data improves performance on both in- and <b>out-of-distribution.</b> Furthermore, we show that data quality, which can be drastically improved by proposed quality filters, matters more than quantity in improving Evidence-Based <b>QA.</b>

**ABSTRACT**  
We present a novel dataset for the controlled composition of counterarguments designed for further applications in argument refining, mining, and evaluation. Our dataset constitutes enriched counter-arguments to posts in the Reddit ChangeMyView dataset that are integrated with evidence retrieved from high-quality sources and generated based on user preferences, adjusting the critical attributes of evidence and argument style. The resultant Counterfire corpus comprises arguments generated from <b>GPT-3.5</b> turbo, Koala, and <b>PaLM</b> 2 models and two of their <b>finetuned</b> variants (N = 32,000). Model evaluation indicates strong paraphrasing abilities with evidence, albeit limited word overlap, while demonstrating high style integration (0.9682 for 'reciprocity'), showing the ability of <b>LLM</b> to assimilate diverse styles. Of all models, <b>GPT-3.5</b> turbo showed the highest scores in argument quality evaluation, showing consistent accuracy (score >0.8). In further analyses, reciprocity-style counterarguments display higher counts in most categories, possibly indicating a more creatively persuasive use of evidence. In contrast, human-written counterarguments exhibited greater argumentative richness and diversity across categories. Despite human-written arguments being favored as the most persuasive in human evaluation, the 'No Style' generated text surprisingly exhibited the highest score, <b>prompting</b> further exploration and investigation on the trade-offs in generation for facts and style.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this paper, we focus on solving one of the most important tasks in the field of <b>speech</b> <b>processing,</b> i.e., <b>automatic</b> <b>speech</b> <b>recognition</b> <b>(ASR),</b> with <b>speech</b> <b>foundation</b> encoders and <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> <b>(LLM).</b> Recent works have complex designs such as compressing the output temporally for the <b>speech</b> <b>encoder,</b> tackling modal alignment for the projector, and utilizing parameter-efficient <b>fine-tuning</b> for the <b>LLM.</b> We found that delicate designs are not necessary, while an embarrassingly simple composition of off-the-shelf <b>speech</b> <b>encoder,</b> <b>LLM,</b> and the only trainable linear projector is competent for the <b>ASR</b> task. To be more specific, we <b>benchmark</b> and explore various combinations of <b>LLMs</b> and <b>speech</b> <b>encoders,</b> leading to the optimal <b>LLM-based</b> <b>ASR</b> system, which we call SLAM-ASR. The proposed SLAM-ASR provides a clean setup and little task-specific design, where only the linear projector is trained. To the best of our knowledge, SLAM-ASR achieves the best performance on the Librispeech <b>benchmark</b> among <b>LLM-based</b> <b>ASR</b> models and even outperforms the latest <b>LLM-based</b> audio-universal model trained on massive pair data. Finally, we explore the capability emergence of <b>LLM-based</b> <b>ASR</b> in the process of modal alignment. We hope that our study can facilitate the research on extending <b>LLM</b> with cross-modality capacity and shed light on the <b>LLM-based</b> <b>ASR</b> community.

**ABSTRACT**  
With tremendous efforts on developing effective e-commerce models, conventional e-commerce models show limited success in generalist e-commerce modeling, and suffer from unsatisfactory performance on new users and new products - a typical <b>out-of-domain</b> generalization challenge. Meanwhile, <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> <b>(LLMs)</b> demonstrate outstanding performance in generalist modeling and <b>out-of-domain</b> generalizability in many fields. Toward fully unleashing their power for e-commerce, in this paper, we construct ECInstruct, the first open-sourced, <b>large-scale,</b> <b>and</b> <b>high-quality</b> <b>benchmark</b> <b>instruction</b> <b>dataset</b> for e-commerce. Leveraging ECInstruct, we develop eCeLLM, a series of e-commerce <b>LLMs,</b> by <b>instruction-tuning</b> <b>general-purpose</b> <b>LLMs.</b> Our comprehensive experiments and evaluation demonstrate that eCeLLM models substantially outperform baseline models, including the most advanced <b>GPT-4,</b> and the state-of-the-art task-specific models in in-domain evaluation. Moreover, eCeLLM exhibits excellent generalizability to <b>out-of-domain</b> settings, including unseen products and unseen <b>instructions,</b> <b>highlighting</b> its superiority as a generalist e-commerce model. Both the ECInstruct dataset and the eCeLLM models show great potential in empowering versatile and effective <b>LLMs</b> for e-commerce. ECInstruct and eCeLLM models are publicly accessible through https://ninglab.github.io/eCeLLM.

**ABSTRACT**  
Do current <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> <b>(LLMs)</b> better solve <b>graph</b> <b>reasoning</b> and generation tasks with parameter updates? In this paper, we propose InstructGraph, a framework that empowers <b>LLMs</b> with the abilities of <b>graph</b> <b>reasoning</b> and generation by <b>instruction</b> <b>tuning</b> and preference alignment. Specifically, we first propose a structured format verbalizer to unify all <b>graph</b> data into a universal code-like format, which can simply represent the <b>graph</b> without any external <b>graph-specific</b> encoders. Furthermore, a <b>graph</b> <b>instruction</b> <b>tuning</b> stage is introduced to guide <b>LLMs</b> in solving <b>graph</b> <b>reasoning</b> and generation tasks. Finally, we identify potential hallucination problems in <b>graph</b> tasks and sample negative instances for preference alignment, the target of which is to enhance the output's reliability of the model.

**ABSTRACT**  
The permanence of online content combined with the enhanced authorship identification techniques calls for stronger computational methods to protect the identity and privacy of online authorship when needed, e.g., blind reviews for scientific papers, anonymous online reviews, or anonymous interactions in the mental health forums. In this paper, we propose an <b>unsupervised</b> inference-time approach to authorship obfuscation to address the unique challenges of authorship obfuscation: lack of supervision data for diverse authorship and domains, and the need for a sufficient level of revision beyond simple paraphrasing to obfuscate the authorship, all the while preserving the original content and fluency. We introduce JAMDEC, a user-controlled, inference-time algorithm for authorship obfuscation that can be in principle applied to any text and authorship. Our approach builds on small language models such as <b>GPT2-XL</b> in order to help avoid disclosing the original content to proprietary <b>LLM's</b> APIs, while also reducing the performance gap between small and <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> via algorithmic enhancement. The key idea behind our approach is to boost the creative power of smaller language models through constrained decoding, while also allowing for user-specified controls and flexibility. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach based on <b>GPT2-XL</b> outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods based on comparably small models, while performing competitively against <b>GPT3.5</b> 175B, a propriety model that is two orders of magnitudes larger.

**ABSTRACT**  
The increasing use of complex and opaque black box models requires the adoption of interpretable measures, one such option is extractive rationalizing models, which serve as a more interpretable alternative. These models, also known as Explain-Then-Predict models, employ an explainer model to extract rationales and subsequently condition the predictor with the extracted information. Their primary objective is to provide precise and faithful explanations, represented by the extracted rationales. In this paper, we take a semi-supervised approach to optimize for the plausibility of extracted rationales. We adopt a pre-trained <b>natural</b> <b>language</b> <b>inference</b> <b>(NLI)</b> model and further <b>fine-tune</b> it on a small set of <b>supervised</b> rationales ($10\%$). The <b>NLI</b> predictor is leveraged as a source of supervisory signals to the explainer via entailment alignment. We show that, by enforcing the alignment agreement between the explanation and answer in a <b>question-answering</b> <b>task,</b> the performance can be improved without access to ground truth labels. We evaluate our approach on the ERASER dataset and show that our approach achieves comparable results with <b>supervised</b> extractive models and outperforms <b>unsupervised</b> approaches by $> 100\%$.

**ABSTRACT**  
Adapting state-of-the-art <b>Large</b> <b>Language</b> <b>Models</b> <b>(LLMs)</b> like <b>GPT-4</b> and <b>Gemini</b> for specific tasks is challenging. Due to the opacity in their parameters, embeddings, and even output probabilities, existing <b>fine-tuning</b> adaptation methods are inapplicable. Consequently, adapting these black-box <b>LLMs</b> is only possible through their API services, raising concerns about transparency, privacy, and cost. To address these challenges, we introduce BBox-Adapter, a novel lightweight adapter for black-box <b>LLMs.</b> BBox-Adapter distinguishes target and source domain data by treating target data as positive and source data as negative. It employs a ranking-based Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) loss to promote the likelihood of target domain data while penalizing that of the source domain. Furthermore, it features an online adaptation mechanism, which incorporates real-time positive data sampling from ground-truth, human, or AI feedback, coupled with negative data from previous adaptations. Extensive experiments demonstrate BBox-Adapter's effectiveness and cost efficiency. It improves model performance by up to 6.77% across diverse tasks and domains, while reducing training and inference costs by 31.30x and 1.84x, respectively.

**ABSTRACT**  
Text-to-SQL <b>semantic</b> <b>parsing</b> has made significant progress in recent years, with various models demonstrating impressive performance on the challenging Spider <b>benchmark.</b> However, it has also been shown that these models often struggle to generalize even when faced with small perturbations of previously (accurately) parsed expressions. This is mainly due to the linguistic form of questions in Spider which are overly specific, unnatural, and display limited variation. In this work, we use <b>data</b> <b>augmentation</b> to enhance the robustness of text-to-SQL parsers against natural language variations. Existing approaches generate question reformulations either via models trained on Spider or only introduce local changes. In contrast, we leverage the capabilities of <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> to generate more realistic and diverse questions. Using only a few <b>prompts,</b> we achieve a two-fold increase in the number of questions in Spider. Training on this augmented dataset yields substantial improvements on a range of evaluation sets, including robustness <b>benchmarks</b> and <b>out-of-domain</b> data.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Pretrained</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> are long known to be subpar in capturing sentence and document-level semantics. Though heavily investigated, transferring perturbation-based methods from <b>unsupervised</b> visual representation learning to NLP remains an unsolved problem. This is largely due to the discreteness of subword units brought by <b>tokenization</b> of language models, limiting small perturbations of inputs to form semantics-preserved positive pairs. In this work, we conceptualize the learning of sentence-level textual semantics as a visual representation learning process. Drawing from cognitive and linguistic sciences, we introduce an <b>unsupervised</b> visual sentence representation learning framework, employing visually-grounded text perturbation methods like typos and word order shuffling, resonating with human cognitive patterns, and enabling perturbation to texts to be perceived as continuous. Our approach is further bolstered by large-scale <b>unsupervised</b> topical alignment training and <b>natural</b> <b>language</b> <b>inference</b> supervision, achieving comparable performance in semantic textual similarity (STS) to existing state-of-the-art NLP methods. Additionally, we unveil our method's inherent <b>zero-shot</b> cross-lingual transferability and a unique leapfrogging pattern across languages during iterative training. To our knowledge, this is the first representation learning method devoid of traditional language models for understanding sentence and document semantics, marking a stride closer to human-like textual comprehension.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Prompt</b> tuning, in which <b>prompts</b> are optimized to adapt large-scale <b>pre-trained</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> to downstream tasks instead of <b>fine-tuning</b> the full model parameters, has been shown to be particularly effective when the <b>prompts</b> are trained in a multi-task <b>transfer</b> <b>learning</b> setting. These methods generally involve individually training <b>prompts</b> for each source task and then aggregating them to provide the initialization of the <b>prompt</b> for the target task. However, this approach critically ignores the fact that some of the source tasks could be negatively or positively interfering with each other. We argue that when we extract knowledge from source tasks via training source <b>prompts,</b> we need to consider this correlation among source tasks for better <b>transfer</b> <b>to</b> target tasks. To this end, we propose a Bayesian approach where we work with the posterior distribution of <b>prompts</b> across source tasks. We obtain representative source <b>prompts</b> corresponding to the samples from the posterior utilizing Stein Variational Gradient Descent, which are then aggregated to constitute the initial target <b>prompt.</b> We show extensive experimental results on the standard <b>benchmark</b> NLP tasks, where our Bayesian multi-task <b>transfer</b> <b>learning</b> approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in many settings. Furthermore, our approach requires no auxiliary models other than the <b>prompt</b> itself, achieving a high degree of parameter efficiency.

We use M2KR to develop PreFLMR, a pre-trained version of the recently developed Fine-grained Late-interaction <b>Multi-modal</b> Retriever (FLMR) approach to KB-VQA, and we report new state-of-the-art results across a range of tasks. We also present investigations into the scaling behaviors of PreFLMR intended to be useful in future developments in general-purpose <b>multi-modal</b> retrievers.

**ABSTRACT**  
Parameter-efficient tuning (PEFT) techniques like low-rank adaptation (LoRA) offer training efficiency on <b>Large</b> <b>Language</b> <b>Models,</b> but their impact on model performance remains limited. Recent efforts integrate LoRA and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to improve the performance of PEFT methods. Despite promising results, research on improving the efficiency of LoRA with MoE is still in its early stages. Recent studies have shown that experts in the MoE architecture have different strengths and also exhibit some redundancy. Does this statement also apply to parameter-efficient MoE? In this paper, we introduce a novel parameter-efficient MoE method, \textit{\textbf{M}oE-L\textbf{o}RA with \textbf{L}ayer-wise Expert \textbf{A}llocation (MoLA)} for <b>Transformer-based</b> models, where each model layer has the flexibility to employ a varying number of LoRA experts. We investigate several architectures with varying layer-wise expert configurations. Experiments on six well-known NLP and commonsense <b>QA</b> <b>benchmarks</b> demonstrate that MoLA achieves equal or superior performance compared to all baselines. We find that allocating more LoRA experts to higher layers further enhances the effectiveness of models with a certain number of experts in total. With much fewer parameters, this allocation strategy outperforms the setting with the same number of experts in every layer. This work can be widely used as a plug-and-play parameter-efficient tuning approach for various applications. The code is available at https://github.com/GCYZSL/MoLA.

As <b>Large</b> <b>Language</b> <b>Models</b> <b>(LLMs)</b> become more proficient, their misuse in <b>large-scale</b> <b>viral</b> <b>disinformation</b> campaigns is a growing concern. This study explores the capability of <b>ChatGPT</b> to generate unconditioned claims about the war in Ukraine, an event beyond its knowledge cutoff, and evaluates whether such claims can be differentiated by human readers and automated tools from human-written ones. We compare war-related claims from ClaimReview, authored by IFCN-registered fact-checkers, and similar short-form content generated by <b>ChatGPT.</b> We demonstrate that <b>ChatGPT</b> can produce realistic, target-specific disinformation cheaply, fast, and at scale, and that these claims cannot be reliably distinguished by humans or existing automated tools.

**ABSTRACT**  
Table <b>reasoning,</b> which aims to generate the corresponding answer to the question following the user requirement according to the provided table, and optionally a text description of the table, effectively improving the efficiency of obtaining information. Recently, using <b>Large</b> <b>Language</b> <b>Models</b> <b>(LLMs)</b> has become the mainstream method for table <b>reasoning,</b> because it not only significantly reduces the annotation cost but also exceeds the performance of previous methods. However, existing research still lacks a summary of <b>LLM-based</b> table <b>reasoning</b> works. Due to the existing lack of research, questions about which techniques can improve table <b>reasoning</b> performance in the era of <b>LLMs,</b> why <b>LLMs</b> excel at table <b>reasoning,</b> and how to enhance table <b>reasoning</b> abilities in the future, remain largely unexplored. This gap significantly limits progress in research. To answer the above questions and advance table <b>reasoning</b> research with <b>LLMs,</b> we present this survey to analyze existing research, inspiring future work. In this paper, we analyze the mainstream techniques used to improve table <b>reasoning</b> performance in the <b>LLM</b> era, and the advantages of <b>LLMs</b> compared to pre-LLMs for solving table <b>reasoning.</b> We provide research directions from both the improvement of existing methods and the expansion of practical applications to inspire future research.

**ABSTRACT**  
Backdoor attacks are commonly executed by contaminating training data, such that a trigger can activate predetermined harmful effects during the test phase. In this work, we present AnyDoor, a test-time backdoor attack against <b>multimodal</b> <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> (MLLMs), which involves injecting the backdoor into the textual modality using <b>adversarial</b> <b>test</b> images (sharing the same universal perturbation), without requiring access to or modification of the training data. AnyDoor employs similar techniques used in universal <b>adversarial</b> <b>attacks,</b> but distinguishes itself by its ability to decouple the timing of setup and activation of harmful effects. In our experiments, we validate the effectiveness of AnyDoor against popular MLLMs such as LLaVA-1.5, MiniGPT-4, InstructBLIP, and BLIP-2, as well as provide comprehensive ablation studies. Notably, because the backdoor is injected by a universal perturbation, AnyDoor can dynamically change its backdoor trigger prompts/harmful effects, exposing a new challenge for defending against backdoor attacks.

**ABSTRACT**  
A <b>multimodal</b> <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>model</b> (MLLM) agent can receive instructions, capture images, retrieve histories from memory, and decide which tools to use. Nonetheless, red-teaming efforts have revealed that adversarial images/prompts can jailbreak an MLLM and cause unaligned behaviors. In this work, we report an even more severe safety issue in multi-agent environments, referred to as infectious jailbreak. It entails the adversary simply jailbreaking a single agent, and without any further intervention from the adversary, (almost) all agents will become infected exponentially fast and exhibit harmful behaviors. To validate the feasibility of infectious jailbreak, we simulate multi-agent environments containing up to one million LLaVA-1.5 agents, and employ randomized pair-wise chat as a proof-of-concept instantiation for multi-agent interaction. Our results show that feeding an (infectious) adversarial image into the memory of any randomly chosen agent is sufficient to achieve infectious jailbreak. Finally, we derive a simple principle for determining whether a defense mechanism can provably restrain the spread of infectious jailbreak, but how to design a practical defense that meets this principle remains an open question to investigate.

**ABSTRACT**  
Language Models as a Service (LMaaS) offers convenient access for developers and researchers to perform inference using <b>pre-trained</b> <b>language</b> <b>models.</b> Nonetheless, the input data and the inference results containing private information are exposed as plaintext during the service call, leading to privacy issues. Recent studies have started tackling the privacy issue by transforming input data into privacy-preserving representation from the user-end with the techniques such as noise addition and content perturbation, while the exploration of inference result protection, namely decision privacy, is still a blank page. In order to maintain the black-box manner of LMaaS, conducting data privacy protection, especially for the decision, is a challenging task because the process has to be seamless to the models and accompanied by limited communication and computation overhead. We thus propose Instance-Obfuscated Inference (IOI) method, which focuses on addressing the decision privacy issue of <b>natural</b> <b>language</b> <b>understanding</b> tasks in their complete life-cycle. Besides, we conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the performance as well as the privacy-protection strength of the proposed method on various <b>benchmarking</b> tasks.

**ABSTRACT**  
Knowledge editing (KE) aims to efficiently and precisely modify the behavior of <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> <b>(LLMs)</b> to update specific knowledge without negatively influencing other knowledge. Current research primarily focuses on white-box <b>LLMs</b> editing, overlooking an important scenario: black-box <b>LLMs</b> editing, where <b>LLMs</b> are accessed through interfaces and only textual output is available. To address the limitations of existing evaluations that are not inapplicable to black-box <b>LLM</b> editing and lack comprehensiveness, we propose a multi-perspective evaluation framework, incorporating the assessment of style retention for the first time. To tackle privacy leaks of editing data and style over-editing in current methods, we introduce a novel postEdit framework, resolving privacy concerns through downstream post-processing and maintaining textual style consistency via fine-grained editing to original responses. Experiments and analysis on two <b>benchmarks</b> demonstrate that postEdit outperforms all baselines and achieves strong generalization, especially with huge improvements on style retention (average $+20.82\%\uparrow$).

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper reports our work on building up a Cantonese <b>Speech-to-Text</b> <b>(STT)</b> system with a syllable based acoustic model. This is a part of an effort in building a STT system to aid dyslexic students who have cognitive deficiency in writing skills but have no problem expressing their ideas through <b>speech.</b> <b>For</b> Cantonese <b>speech</b> <b>recognition,</b> the basic unit of acoustic models can either be the conventional Initial-Final (IF) syllables, or the Onset-Nucleus-Coda (ONC) syllables where finals are further split into nucleus and coda to reflect the intra-syllable variations in Cantonese. By using the Kaldi toolkit, our system is trained using the <b>stochastic</b> <b>gradient</b> <b>descent</b> optimization model with the aid of GPUs for the hybrid Deep Neural Network and Hidden Markov Model (DNN-HMM) with and without I-vector based speaker adaptive training technique. The input features of the same Gaussian Mixture Model with speaker adaptive training (GMM-SAT) to DNN are used in all cases. Experiments show that the ONC-based syllable acoustic modeling with I-vector based DNN-HMM achieves the best performance with the word error rate (WER) of 9.66% and the real time factor (RTF) of 1.38812.

**ABSTRACT**  
Exploring and quantifying semantic relatedness is central to representing language. It holds significant implications across various NLP tasks, including offering insights into the capabilities and performance of <b>Large</b> <b>Language</b> <b>Models</b> <b>(LLMs).</b> While earlier NLP research primarily focused on semantic similarity, often within the English language context, we instead investigate the broader phenomenon of semantic relatedness. In this paper, we present SemRel, a new semantic relatedness dataset collection annotated by native speakers across 14 languages:Afrikaans, Algerian Arabic, Amharic, English, Hausa, Hindi, Indonesian, Kinyarwanda, Marathi, Moroccan Arabic, Modern Standard Arabic, Punjabi, Spanish, and Telugu. These languages originate from five distinct language families and are predominantly spoken in Africa and Asia -- regions characterised by a relatively limited availability of NLP resources. Each instance in the SemRel datasets is a sentence pair associated with a score that represents the degree of semantic textual relatedness between the two sentences. The scores are obtained using a comparative annotation framework. We describe the data collection and annotation processes, related challenges when building the datasets, and their impact and utility in NLP. We further report experiments for each language and across the different languages.

**ABSTRACT**  
Improving factual consistency in abstractive <b>summarization</b> has been a focus of current research. One promising approach is the post-editing method. However, previous works have yet to make sufficient use of factual factors in summaries and suffers from the negative effect of the training datasets. In this paper, we first propose a novel factual error correction model FactCloze based on a conditional-generation cloze task. FactCloze can construct the causality among factual factors while being able to determine whether the blank can be answered or not. Then, we propose a data <b>distillation</b> method to generate a more faithful <b>summarization</b> dataset SummDSC via multiple-dimensional evaluation. We experimentally validate the effectiveness of our approach, which leads to an improvement in multiple factual consistency metrics compared to baselines.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper presents three established theories of human decision-making and describes how they can be integrated to provide a model of purposive human action. Taking seriously the idea of language as action the model is then applied to the conversational user interfaces. Theory based AI research has had a hard time recently and the aim here is to revitalise interest in understanding what <b>LLMs</b> are actually doing other than running poorly understood machine learning routines over all the data the relevant Big Tech company can hoover up. When a raspberry pi computer for under 50USD is up to 400 times faster than the first commercial Cray super computer~\cite{crayVpi}, Big Tech can get really close to having an infinite number of monkeys typing at random and producing text, some of which will make sense. By understanding where <b>ChatGPT's</b> apparent intelligence comes from, perhaps we can perform the magic with fewer resources and at the same time gain some understanding about our relationship with our world.

**ABSTRACT**  
The study of social values in fairy tales opens the possibility to learn about the communication of values across space and time. We propose to study the communication of values in fairy tales from Portugal, Italy and Germany using a technique called <b>word</b> <b>embedding</b> with a compass to quantify vocabulary differences and commonalities. We study how these three national traditions of fairy tales differ in their explicit references to values. To do this, we specify a list of value-charged tokens, consider their <b>word</b> <b>stems</b> and analyse the distance between these in a bespoke pre-trained <b>Word2Vec</b> model. We triangulate and critically discuss the validity of the resulting hypotheses emerging from this quantitative model. Our claim is that this is a reusable and reproducible method for the study of the values explicitly referenced in historical corpora. Finally, our preliminary findings hint at a shared cultural understanding and the expression of values such as Benevolence, Conformity, and Universalism across European societies, suggesting the existence of a pan-European cultural memory.

**ABSTRACT**  
As <b>Large</b> <b>Language</b> <b>Models</b> <b>(LLMs)</b> rapidly evolve, their influence in science is becoming increasingly prominent. The emerging capabilities of <b>LLMs</b> in task generalization and free-form dialogue can significantly advance fields like chemistry and biology. However, the field of single-cell biology, which forms the foundational building blocks of living organisms, still faces several challenges. High knowledge barriers and limited scalability in current methods restrict the full exploitation of <b>LLMs</b> in mastering single-cell data, impeding direct accessibility and rapid iteration. To this end, we introduce ChatCell, which signifies a paradigm shift by facilitating single-cell analysis with natural language. Leveraging vocabulary adaptation and unified sequence generation, ChatCell has acquired profound expertise in single-cell biology and the capability to accommodate a diverse range of analysis tasks. Extensive experiments further demonstrate ChatCell's robust performance and potential to deepen single-cell insights, paving the way for more accessible and intuitive exploration in this pivotal field. Our project homepage is available at https://zjunlp.github.io/project/ChatCell.

**ABSTRACT**  
Jailbreaks on <b>Large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> <b>(LLMs)</b> have recently received increasing attention. For a comprehensive assessment of <b>LLM</b> safety, it is essential to consider jailbreaks with diverse attributes, such as contextual coherence and sentiment/stylistic variations, and hence it is beneficial to study controllable jailbreaking, i.e. how to enforce control on <b>LLM</b> attacks. In this paper, we formally formulate the controllable attack generation problem, and build a novel connection between this problem and controllable <b>text</b> <b>generation,</b> a well-explored topic of natural language processing. Based on this connection, we adapt the Energy-based Constrained Decoding with Langevin Dynamics (COLD), a state-of-the-art, highly efficient algorithm in controllable <b>text</b> <b>generation,</b> and introduce the COLD-Attack framework which unifies and automates the search of adversarial <b>LLM</b> attacks under a variety of control requirements such as fluency, stealthiness, sentiment, and left-right-coherence. The controllability enabled by COLD-Attack leads to diverse new jailbreak scenarios which not only cover the standard setting of generating fluent suffix attacks, but also allow us to address new controllable attack settings such as revising a user query adversarially with minimal paraphrasing, and inserting stealthy attacks in context with left-right-coherence. Our extensive experiments on various <b>LLMs</b> <b>(Llama-2,</b> <b>Mistral,</b> Vicuna, Guanaco, <b>GPT-3.5)</b> show COLD-Attack's broad applicability, strong controllability, high success rate, and attack transferability. Our code is available at https://github.com/Yu-Fangxu/COLD-Attack.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Graph</b> <b>Neural</b> <b>Networks</b> <b>(GNNs)</b> have empowered the advance in <b>graph-structured</b> <b>data</b> <b>analysis.</b> Recently, the rise of <b>Large</b> <b>Language</b> <b>Models</b> <b>(LLMs)</b> like <b>GPT-4</b> has heralded a new era in deep learning. However, their application to <b>graph</b> <b>data</b> <b>poses</b> distinct challenges due to the inherent difficulty of translating <b>graph</b> <b>structures</b> <b>to</b> language. To this end, we introduce the \textbf{L}arge \textbf{L}anguage \textbf{a}nd \textbf{G}raph \textbf{A}ssistant (\textbf{LLaGA}), an innovative model that effectively integrates <b>LLM</b> capabilities to handle the complexities of <b>graph-structured</b> <b>data.</b> <b>LLaGA</b> retains the general-purpose nature of <b>LLMs</b> while adapting <b>graph</b> <b>data</b> <b>into</b> a format compatible with <b>LLM</b> input. LLaGA achieves this by reorganizing <b>graph</b> <b>nodes</b> <b>to</b> structure-aware sequences and then mapping these into the token embedding space through a versatile projector. LLaGA excels in versatility, generalizability and interpretability, allowing it to perform consistently well across different datasets and tasks, extend its ability to unseen datasets or tasks, and provide explanations for <b>graphs.</b> <b>Our</b> <b>extensive</b> experiments across popular <b>graph</b> <b>benchmarks</b> <b>show</b> that LLaGA delivers outstanding performance across four datasets and three tasks using one single model, surpassing state-of-the-art <b>graph</b> <b>models</b> <b>in</b> both <b>supervised</b> and <b>zero-shot</b> scenarios.

**ABSTRACT**  
The advancement of Large <b>Vision-Language</b> Models (LVLMs) has increasingly highlighted the critical issue of their tendency to hallucinate non-existing objects in the images. To address this issue, previous works focused on using specially curated datasets or powerful <b>LLMs</b> (e.g., <b>GPT-3.5)</b> to rectify the outputs of LVLMs. However, these approaches require either expensive training/fine-tuning or API access to advanced <b>LLMs</b> to correct the model's output post-generation. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by introducing a framework called Mitigating hallucinAtion via classifieR-Free guIdaNcE (MARINE), which is both training-free and API-free, and can effectively and efficiently reduce object hallucinations during the generation process. Specifically, MARINE enriches the visual context of LVLMs by integrating existing open-source vision models, and employs classifier-free guidance to incorporate the additional object <b>grounding</b> features to improve the precision of LVLMs' generations. Through comprehensive evaluations across $6$ popular LVLMs with diverse evaluation metrics, we demonstrate the effectiveness of MARINE, which even outperforms existing <b>fine-tuning-based</b> methods. Remarkably, it not only reduces hallucinations but also improves the detailedness of LVLMs' generations, as assessed by <b>GPT-4V.</b>

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Graph</b> <b>Neural</b> <b>Networks</b> <b>(GNNs)</b> have demonstrated significant success in learning from <b>graph-structured</b> <b>data</b> <b>across</b> various domains. Despite their great successful, one critical challenge is often overlooked by existing works, i.e., the learning of message propagation that can generalize effectively to underrepresented <b>graph</b> <b>regions.</b> <b>These</b> minority regions often exhibit irregular homophily/heterophily patterns and diverse neighborhood class distributions, resulting in ambiguity. In this work, we investigate the ambiguity problem within <b>GNNs,</b> its impact on representation learning, and the development of richer supervision signals to fight against this problem. We conduct a fine-grained evaluation of <b>GNN,</b> analyzing the existence of ambiguity in different <b>graph</b> <b>regions</b> <b>and</b> its relation with <b>node</b> <b>positions.</b> To disambiguate <b>node</b> <b>embeddings,</b> we propose a novel method, {\method}, which exploits additional optimization guidance to enhance representation learning, particularly for <b>nodes</b> <b>in</b> ambiguous regions. {\method} identifies ambiguous <b>nodes</b> <b>based</b> on temporal inconsistency of predictions and introduces a <b>disambiguation</b> regularization by employing <b>contrastive</b> <b>learning</b> in a topology-aware manner. {\method} promotes discriminativity of <b>node</b> <b>representations</b> and can alleviating semantic mixing caused by message propagation, effectively addressing the ambiguity problem. Empirical results validate the efficiency of {\method} and highlight its potential to improve <b>GNN</b> performance in underrepresented <b>graph</b> regions.

**ABSTRACT**  
We explore <b>machine</b> <b>unlearning</b> (MU) in the domain of <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> <b>(LLMs),</b> referred to as <b>LLM</b> unlearning. This initiative aims to eliminate undesirable data influence (e.g., sensitive or illegal information) and the associated model capabilities, while maintaining the integrity of essential knowledge generation and not affecting causally unrelated information. We envision <b>LLM</b> unlearning becoming a pivotal element in the life-cycle management of <b>LLMs,</b> potentially standing as an essential foundation for developing <b>generative</b> <b>AI</b> that is not only safe, secure, and trustworthy, but also resource-efficient without the need of full retraining. We navigate the unlearning landscape in <b>LLMs</b> from conceptual formulation, methodologies, metrics, and applications. In particular, we highlight the often-overlooked aspects of existing <b>LLM</b> unlearning research, e.g., unlearning scope, data-model interaction, and multifaceted efficacy assessment. We also draw connections between <b>LLM</b> unlearning and related areas such as model editing, influence functions, model explanation, <b>adversarial</b> <b>training,</b> and <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning.</b> Furthermore, we outline an effective assessment framework for <b>LLM</b> unlearning and explore its applications in copyright and privacy safeguards and sociotechnical harm reduction.

**ABSTRACT**  
Spear-phishing attacks present a significant security challenge, with <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> <b>(LLMs)</b> escalating the threat by generating convincing emails and facilitating target reconnaissance. To address this, we propose a detection approach based on a novel <b>document</b> <b>vectorization</b> method that utilizes an ensemble of <b>LLMs</b> to create representation vectors. By <b>prompting</b> <b>LLMs</b> to reason and respond to human-crafted questions, we quantify the presence of common persuasion principles in the email's content, producing <b>prompted</b> contextual <b>document</b> <b>vectors</b> for a downstream <b>supervised</b> machine learning model. We evaluate our method using a unique dataset generated by a proprietary system that automates target reconnaissance and spear-phishing email creation. Our method achieves a 91% F1 score in identifying <b>LLM-generated</b> spear-phishing emails, with the training set comprising only traditional phishing and benign emails. Key contributions include an innovative <b>document</b> <b>vectorization</b> method utilizing <b>LLM</b> <b>reasoning,</b> a publicly available dataset of high-quality spear-phishing emails, and the demonstrated effectiveness of our method in detecting such emails. This methodology can be utilized for various <b>document</b> <b>classification</b> tasks, particularly in adversarial problem domains.

**ABSTRACT**  
Machine learning models often excel on in-distribution (ID) data but struggle with unseen <b>out-of-distribution</b> (OOD) inputs. Most techniques for improving OOD robustness are not applicable to settings where the model is effectively a black box, such as when the weights are frozen, retraining is costly, or the model is leveraged via an API. Test-time augmentation (TTA) is a simple post-hoc technique for improving robustness that sidesteps black-box constraints by aggregating predictions across multiple augmentations of the test input. TTA has seen limited use in NLP due to the challenge of generating effective natural language augmentations. In this work, we propose <b>LLM-TTA,</b> which uses <b>LLM-generated</b> augmentations as TTA's augmentation function. <b>LLM-TTA</b> outperforms conventional augmentation functions across sentiment, toxicity, and news classification tasks for <b>BERT</b> and <b>T5</b> models, with <b>BERT's</b> OOD robustness improving by an average of 4.30 percentage points without regressing average ID performance. We explore selectively augmenting inputs based on prediction entropy to reduce the rate of expensive <b>LLM</b> augmentations, allowing us to maintain performance gains while reducing the average number of generated augmentations by 57.76%. <b>LLM-TTA</b> is agnostic to the task model architecture, does not require OOD labels, and is effective across low and <b>high-resource</b> settings. We share our data, models, and code for reproducibility.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Graph</b> <b>Neural</b> <b>Networks</b> <b>(GNNs)</b> have shown promising potential in <b>graph</b> <b>representation</b> <b>learning.</b> The majority of <b>GNNs</b> define a local <b>message-passing</b> mechanism, propagating information over the <b>graph</b> <b>by</b> <b>stacking</b> multiple layers. These methods, however, are known to suffer from two major limitations: over-squashing and poor capturing of long-range dependencies. Recently, <b>Graph</b> <b>Transformers</b> <b>(GTs)</b> emerged as a powerful alternative to <b>Message-Passing</b> Neural Networks (MPNNs). GTs, however, have quadratic computational cost, lack inductive biases on <b>graph</b> <b>structures,</b> <b>and</b> rely on complex Positional/Structural Encodings (SE/PE). In this paper, we show that while <b>Transformers,</b> complex <b>message-passing,</b> and SE/PE are sufficient for good performance in practice, neither is necessary. Motivated by the recent success of State Space Models (SSMs), such as Mamba, we present <b>Graph</b> <b>Mamba</b> <b>Networks</b> (GMNs), a general framework for a new class of <b>GNNs</b> based on selective SSMs. We discuss and categorize the new challenges when adopting SSMs to <b>graph-structured</b> <b>data,</b> <b>and</b> present four required and one optional steps to design GMNs, where we choose (1) Neighborhood <b>Tokenization,</b> (2) Token Ordering, (3) Architecture of Bidirectional Selective SSM Encoder, (4) Local Encoding, and dispensable (5) PE and SE. We further provide theoretical justification for the power of GMNs. Experiments demonstrate that despite much less computational cost, GMNs attain an outstanding performance in long-range, small-scale, large-scale, and heterophilic <b>benchmark</b> datasets.

**ABSTRACT**  
Reward <b>finetuning</b> has emerged as a promising approach to aligning <b>foundation</b> <b>models</b> with downstream objectives. Remarkable success has been achieved in the language domain by using <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning</b> (RL) to maximize rewards that reflect human preference. However, in the vision domain, existing RL-based reward <b>finetuning</b> methods are limited by their instability in large-scale training, rendering them incapable of generalizing to complex, unseen <b>prompts.</b> In this paper, we propose Proximal Reward Difference Prediction (PRDP), enabling stable black-box reward <b>finetuning</b> for diffusion models for the first time on large-scale <b>prompt</b> datasets with over 100K <b>prompts.</b> Our key innovation is the Reward Difference Prediction (RDP) objective that has the same optimal solution as the RL objective while enjoying better training stability. Specifically, the RDP objective is a <b>supervised</b> regression objective that tasks the diffusion model with predicting the reward difference of generated image pairs from their denoising trajectories. We theoretically prove that the diffusion model that obtains perfect reward difference prediction is exactly the maximizer of the RL objective. We further develop an online algorithm with proximal updates to stably optimize the RDP objective. In experiments, we demonstrate that PRDP can match the reward maximization ability of well-established RL-based methods in small-scale training. Furthermore, through large-scale training on text <b>prompts</b> from the Human Preference Dataset v2 and the Pick-a-Pic v1 dataset, PRDP achieves superior generation quality on a diverse set of complex, unseen <b>prompts</b> whereas RL-based methods completely fail.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Federated</b> <b>Learning</b> (FL) has emerged as a promising solution in Edge Computing (EC) environments to process the proliferation of data generated by edge devices. By collaboratively optimizing the global machine learning <b>models</b> <b>on</b> distributed edge devices, FL circumvents the need for transmitting raw data and enhances user privacy. Despite practical successes, FL still confronts significant challenges including constrained edge device resources, multiple tasks deployment, and data heterogeneity. However, existing studies focus on mitigating the FL training costs of each single task whereas neglecting the resource consumption across multiple tasks in heterogeneous FL scenarios. In this paper, we propose Heterogeneous <b>Federated</b> <b>Learning</b> with Local <b>Parameter</b> <b>Sharing</b> (FedLPS) to fill this gap. FedLPS leverages principles from <b>transfer</b> <b>learning</b> to facilitate the deployment of multiple tasks on a single device by dividing the local <b>model</b> <b>into</b> a shareable encoder and task-specific encoders. To further reduce resource consumption, a channel-wise <b>model</b> <b>pruning</b> algorithm that shrinks the footprint of local <b>models</b> <b>while</b> accounting for both data and system heterogeneity is employed in FedLPS. Additionally, a novel heterogeneous <b>model</b> <b>aggregation</b> algorithm is proposed to aggregate the heterogeneous predictors in FedLPS. We implemented the proposed FedLPS on a real FL platform and compared it with state-of-the-art (SOTA) FL frameworks. The experimental results on five popular datasets and two modern DNN <b>models</b> <b>illustrate</b> that the proposed FedLPS significantly outperforms the SOTA FL frameworks by up to 4.88% and reduces the computational resource consumption by 21.3%. Our code is available at:https://github.com/jyzgh/FedLPS.

**ABSTRACT**  
Activation function is a pivotal component of deep learning, facilitating the extraction of intricate data patterns. While classical activation functions like ReLU and its variants are extensively utilized, their static nature and simplicity, despite being advantageous, often limit their effectiveness in specialized tasks. The trainable activation functions also struggle sometimes to adapt to the unique characteristics of the data. Addressing these limitations, we introduce a novel trainable activation function, adaptive piecewise approximated activation linear unit (APALU), to enhance the learning performance of deep learning across a broad range of tasks. It presents a unique set of features that enable it to maintain stability and efficiency in the learning process while adapting to complex data representations. Experiments reveal significant improvements over widely used activation functions for different tasks. In image classification, APALU increases MobileNet and GoogleNet accuracy by 0.37% and 0.04%, respectively, on the CIFAR10 dataset. In <b>anomaly</b> <b>detection,</b> it improves the average area under the curve of One-CLASS Deep SVDD by 0.8% on the <b>MNIST</b> dataset, 1.81% and 1.11% improvements with DifferNet, and <b>knowledge</b> <b>distillation,</b> respectively, on the MVTech dataset. Notably, APALU achieves 100% accuracy on a sign language recognition task with a limited dataset. For regression tasks, APALU enhances the performance of deep neural networks and <b>recurrent</b> <b>neural</b> <b>networks</b> on different datasets. These improvements highlight the robustness and adaptability of APALU across diverse deep-learning applications.

**ABSTRACT**  
Current language models fall short in understanding aspects of the world not easily described in words, and struggle with complex, long-form tasks. Video sequences offer valuable temporal information absent in language and static images, making them attractive for joint modeling with language. Such models could develop a understanding of both human textual knowledge and the physical world, enabling broader AI capabilities for assisting humans. However, learning from millions of tokens of video and language sequences poses challenges due to memory constraints, computational complexity, and limited datasets. To address these challenges, we curate a large dataset of diverse videos and books, utilize the RingAttention technique to scalably train on long sequences, and gradually increase context size from 4K to 1M tokens. This paper makes the following contributions: (a) Largest context size neural network: We train one of the largest context size <b>transformers</b> on long video and language sequences, setting new <b>benchmarks</b> in difficult retrieval tasks and long video understanding. (b) Solutions for overcoming <b>vision-language</b> training challenges, including using masked sequence packing for mixing different sequence lengths, loss weighting to balance language and vision, and model-generated <b>QA</b> dataset for long sequence chat. (c) A highly-optimized implementation with RingAttention, masked sequence packing, and other key features for training on millions-length <b>multimodal</b> sequences. (d) Fully open-sourced a family of 7B parameter models capable of processing long text documents (LWM-Text, LWM-Text-Chat) and videos (LWM, LWM-Chat) of over 1M tokens. This work paves the way for training on massive datasets of long video and language to develop understanding of both human knowledge and the <b>multimodal</b> world, and broader capabilities.

**ABSTRACT**  
Modern <b>graph</b> <b>neural</b> <b>networks</b> <b>(GNNs)</b> can be sensitive to changes in the input <b>graph</b> <b>structure</b> <b>and</b> node features, potentially resulting in unpredictable behavior and degraded performance. In this work, we introduce a spectral framework known as SAGMAN for examining the stability of <b>GNNs.</b> This framework assesses the distance distortions that arise from the nonlinear mappings of <b>GNNs</b> between the input and output manifolds: when two nearby nodes on the input manifold are mapped (through a <b>GNN</b> model) to two distant ones on the output manifold, it implies a large distance distortion and thus a poor <b>GNN</b> stability. We propose a distance-preserving <b>graph</b> <b>dimension</b> <b>reduction</b> (GDR) approach that utilizes spectral <b>graph</b> <b>embedding</b> <b>and</b> probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) to create low-dimensional input/output <b>graph-based</b> <b>manifolds</b> <b>for</b> meaningful stability analysis. Our empirical evaluations show that SAGMAN effectively assesses the stability of each node when subjected to various edge or feature perturbations, offering a scalable approach for evaluating the stability of <b>GNNs,</b> extending to applications within <b>recommendation</b> systems. Furthermore, we illustrate its utility in downstream tasks, notably in enhancing <b>GNN</b> stability and facilitating adversarial targeted attacks.

**ABSTRACT**  
In the realm of <b>Graph</b> <b>Neural</b> <b>Networks</b> <b>(GNNs),</b> two exciting research directions have recently emerged: Subgraph <b>GNNs</b> and <b>Graph</b> <b>Transformers.</b> <b>In</b> this paper, we propose an architecture that integrates both approaches, dubbed Subgraphormer, which combines the enhanced expressive power, <b>message-passing</b> mechanisms, and aggregation schemes from Subgraph <b>GNNs</b> with attention and positional encodings, arguably the most important components in <b>Graph</b> <b>Transformers.</b> <b>Our</b> method is based on an intriguing new connection we reveal between Subgraph <b>GNNs</b> and product <b>graphs,</b> <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> Subgraph <b>GNNs</b> can be formulated as Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) operating on a product of the <b>graph</b> <b>with</b> <b>itself.</b> We use this formulation to design our architecture: first, we devise an attention mechanism based on the connectivity of the product <b>graph.</b> <b>Following</b> <b>this,</b> we propose a novel and efficient positional encoding scheme for Subgraph <b>GNNs,</b> which we derive as a positional encoding for the product <b>graph.</b> <b>Our</b> <b>experimental</b> results demonstrate significant performance improvements over both Subgraph <b>GNNs</b> and <b>Graph</b> <b>Transformers</b> <b>on</b> a wide range of datasets.

**ABSTRACT**  
In the era of widespread social networks, the rapid dissemination of <b>fake</b> <b>news</b> <b>has</b> emerged as a significant threat, inflicting detrimental consequences across various dimensions of people's lives. Machine learning and deep learning approaches have been extensively employed for identifying <b>fake</b> <b>news.</b> <b>However,</b> a significant challenge in identifying <b>fake</b> <b>news</b> <b>is</b> the limited availability of labeled news datasets. Therefore, the One-Class Learning (OCL) approach, utilizing only a small set of labeled data from the interest class, can be a suitable approach to address this challenge. On the other hand, representing data as a <b>graph</b> <b>enables</b> <b>access</b> to diverse content and structural information, and label propagation methods on <b>graphs</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> effective in predicting node labels. In this paper, we adopt a <b>graph-based</b> <b>model</b> <b>for</b> data representation and introduce a semi-supervised and one-class approach for <b>fake</b> <b>news</b> <b>detection,</b> called LOSS-GAT. Initially, we employ a two-step label propagation algorithm, utilizing <b>Graph</b> <b>Neural</b> <b>Networks</b> <b>(GNNs)</b> as an initial classifier to categorize news into two groups: interest <b>(fake)</b> <b>and</b> <b>non-interest</b> (real). Subsequently, we enhance the <b>graph</b> <b>structure</b> <b>using</b> structural augmentation techniques. Ultimately, we predict the final labels for all unlabeled data using a <b>GNN</b> that induces randomness within the local neighborhood of nodes through the aggregation function. We evaluate our proposed method on five common datasets and compare the results against a set of baseline models, including both OCL and binary labeled models. The results demonstrate that LOSS-GAT achieves a notable improvement, surpassing 10%, with the advantage of utilizing only a limited set of labeled <b>fake</b> <b>news.</b> <b>Noteworthy,</b> LOSS-GAT even outperforms binary labeled models.

**ABSTRACT**  
Large-scale numerical <b>simulations</b> often come at the expense of daunting computations. High-Performance Computing has enhanced the process, but adapting legacy codes to leverage parallel GPU computations remains challenging. Meanwhile, Machine Learning models can harness GPU computations effectively but often struggle with generalization and accuracy. <b>Graph</b> <b>Neural</b> <b>Networks</b> <b>(GNNs),</b> in particular, are great for learning from unstructured data like meshes but are often limited to small-scale problems. Moreover, the capabilities of the trained model usually restrict the accuracy of the data-driven solution. To benefit from both worlds, this paper introduces a novel preconditioner integrating a <b>GNN</b> model within a multi-level Domain Decomposition framework. The proposed <b>GNN-based</b> preconditioner is used to enhance the efficiency of a Krylov method, resulting in a hybrid solver that can converge with any desired level of accuracy. The efficiency of the Krylov method greatly benefits from the <b>GNN</b> preconditioner, which is adaptable to meshes of any size and shape, is executed on GPUs, and features a multi-level approach to enforce the scalability of the entire process. Several experiments are conducted to validate the numerical behavior of the hybrid solver, and an in-depth analysis of its performance is proposed to assess its competitiveness against a C++ legacy solver.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Graph</b> <b>neural</b> <b>networks</b> <b>(GNNs)</b> have exhibited remarkable performance under the assumption that test data comes from the same distribution of training data. However, in real-world scenarios, this assumption may not always be valid. Consequently, there is a growing focus on exploring the <b>Out-of-Distribution</b> (OOD) problem in the context of <b>graphs.</b> <b>Most</b> <b>existing</b> efforts have primarily concentrated on improving <b>graph</b> <b>OOD</b> <b>generalization</b> from two \textbf{model-agnostic} perspectives: data-driven methods and strategy-based learning. However, there has been limited attention dedicated to investigating the impact of well-known \textbf{GNN model architectures} on <b>graph</b> <b>OOD</b> <b>generalization,</b> which is orthogonal to existing research. In this work, we provide the first comprehensive investigation of OOD generalization on <b>graphs</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> architecture perspective, by examining the common building blocks of modern <b>GNNs.</b> Through extensive experiments, we reveal that both the <b>graph</b> <b>self-attention</b> <b>mechanism</b> and the decoupled architecture contribute positively to <b>graph</b> <b>OOD</b> <b>generalization.</b> In contrast, we observe that the linear classification layer tends to compromise <b>graph</b> <b>OOD</b> <b>generalization</b> capability. Furthermore, we provide in-depth theoretical insights and discussions to underpin these discoveries. These insights have empowered us to develop a novel <b>GNN</b> backbone model, DGAT, designed to harness the robust properties of both <b>graph</b> <b>self-attention</b> <b>mechanism</b> and the decoupled architecture. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our model under <b>graph</b> <b>OOD,</b> <b>exhibiting</b> substantial and consistent enhancements across various training strategies.

**ABSTRACT**  
This study examines how artificial intelligence (AI), especially <b>Reinforcement</b> <b>Learning</b> (RL), can be used in farming to boost crop yields, <b>fine-tune</b> nitrogen use and watering, and reduce nitrate runoff and greenhouse gases, focusing on Nitrous Oxide (N$_2$O) emissions from soil. Facing climate change and limited agricultural knowledge, we use Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) with a crop simulator to model AI agents' interactions with farming environments. We apply deep Q-learning with <b>Recurrent</b> <b>Neural</b> <b>Network</b> <b>(RNN)-based</b> Q networks for training agents on optimal actions. Also, we develop Machine Learning (ML) models to predict N$_2$O emissions, integrating these predictions into the simulator. Our research tackles uncertainties in N$_2$O emission estimates with a probabilistic ML approach and climate variability through a stochastic weather model, offering a range of emission outcomes to improve forecast reliability and decision-making. By incorporating climate change effects, we enhance agents' climate adaptability, aiming for resilient agricultural practices. Results show these agents can align crop productivity with environmental concerns by penalizing N$_2$O emissions, adapting effectively to climate shifts like warmer temperatures and less rain. This strategy improves farm management under climate change, highlighting AI's role in sustainable agriculture.

**ABSTRACT**  
The recent rapid progress in (self) <b>supervised</b> <b>learning</b> models is in large part predicted by empirical <b>scaling</b> <b>laws:</b> a model's performance scales proportionally to its size. Analogous <b>scaling</b> <b>laws</b> remain elusive for <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning</b> domains, however, where increasing the parameter count of a model often hurts its final performance. In this paper, we demonstrate that incorporating Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) modules, and in particular Soft MoEs (Puigcerver et al., 2023), into value-based networks results in more parameter-scalable models, evidenced by substantial performance increases across a variety of training regimes and model sizes. This work thus provides strong empirical evidence towards developing <b>scaling</b> <b>laws</b> for <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning.</b>

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper contributes a new approach for <b>distributional</b> <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning</b> which elucidates a clean separation of transition structure and reward in the learning process. Analogous to how the successor representation (SR) describes the expected consequences of behaving according to a given policy, our <b>distributional</b> <b>successor</b> <b>measure</b> (SM) describes the <b>distributional</b> <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> this behaviour. We formulate the <b>distributional</b> <b>SM</b> <b>as</b> a distribution over distributions and provide theory connecting it with <b>distributional</b> <b>and</b> <b>model-based</b> <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning.</b> Moreover, we propose an algorithm that learns the <b>distributional</b> <b>SM</b> <b>from</b> data by minimizing a two-level maximum mean discrepancy. Key to our method are a number of algorithmic techniques that are independently valuable for learning generative models of state. As an illustration of the usefulness of the <b>distributional</b> <b>SM,</b> <b>we</b> show that it enables <b>zero-shot</b> risk-sensitive policy evaluation in a way that was not previously possible.

**ABSTRACT**  
Link prediction, which aims to forecast unseen connections in <b>graphs,</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> fundamental task in <b>graph</b> <b>machine</b> <b>learning.</b> Heuristic methods, leveraging a range of different pairwise measures such as common neighbors and shortest paths, often rival the performance of vanilla <b>Graph</b> <b>Neural</b> <b>Networks</b> <b>(GNNs).</b> Therefore, recent advancements in <b>GNNs</b> for link prediction (GNN4LP) have primarily focused on integrating one or a few types of pairwise information. In this work, we reveal that different node pairs within the same dataset necessitate varied pairwise information for accurate prediction and models that only apply the same pairwise information uniformly could achieve suboptimal performance. As a result, we propose a simple mixture of experts model Link-MoE for link prediction. Link-MoE utilizes various <b>GNNs</b> as experts and strategically selects the appropriate expert for each node pair based on various types of pairwise information. Experimental results across diverse real-world datasets demonstrate substantial performance improvement from Link-MoE. Notably, Link-MoE achieves a relative improvement of 18.82\% on the MRR metric for the Pubmed dataset and 10.8\% on the Hits@100 metric for the ogbl-ppa dataset, compared to the best baselines.

**ABSTRACT**  
Incremental learning (IL) is essential to realize the human-level intelligence in the neural network. However, existing IL scenarios and datasets are unqualified for assessing forgetting in <b>PLMs,</b> giving an illusion that <b>PLMs</b> do not suffer from catastrophic forgetting. To this end, we propose a challenging IL scenario called instance-incremental learning (IIL) and a novel dataset called Concept-1K, which supports an order of magnitude larger IL steps. Based on the experiments on Concept-1K, we reveal that billion-parameter <b>PLMs</b> still suffer from catastrophic forgetting, and the forgetting is affected by both model scale, pretraining, and buffer size. Furthermore, existing IL methods and a popular <b>finetuning</b> technique, LoRA, fail to achieve satisfactory performance. Our study provides a novel scenario for future studies to explore the catastrophic forgetting of <b>PLMs</b> and encourage more powerful techniques to be designed for alleviating the forgetting in <b>PLMs.</b> The data, code and scripts are publicly available at https://github.com/zzz47zzz/pretrained-lm-for-incremental-learning.

**ABSTRACT**  
This study addresses the limitations of the traditional analysis of <b>message-passing,</b> central to <b>graph</b> <b>learning,</b> <b>by</b> defining {\em \textbf{generalized propagation}} with directed and weighted <b>graphs.</b> <b>The</b> <b>significance</b> manifest in two ways. \textbf{Firstly}, we propose {\em Generalized Propagation Neural Networks} (\textbf{GPNNs}), a framework that unifies most propagation-based <b>graph</b> <b>neural</b> <b>networks.</b> By generating directed-weighted propagation <b>graphs</b> <b>with</b> <b>adjacency</b> function and connectivity function, GPNNs offer enhanced insights into attention mechanisms across various <b>graph</b> <b>models.</b> <b>We</b> delve into the trade-offs within the design space with empirical experiments and emphasize the crucial role of the adjacency function for model expressivity via theoretical analysis. \textbf{Secondly}, we propose the {\em Continuous Unified Ricci Curvature} (\textbf{CURC}), an extension of celebrated {\em Ollivier-Ricci Curvature} for directed and weighted <b>graphs.</b> <b>Theoretically,</b> <b>we</b> demonstrate that CURC possesses continuity, scale invariance, and a lower bound connection with the Dirichlet isoperimetric constant validating bottleneck analysis for GPNNs. We include a preliminary exploration of learned propagation patterns in datasets, a first in the field. We observe an intriguing ``{\em \textbf{decurve flow}}'' - a curvature reduction during training for models with learnable propagation, revealing the evolution of propagation over time and a deeper connection to over-smoothing and bottleneck trade-off.

**ABSTRACT**  
We propose a novel Spatio-Temporal <b>Graph</b> <b>Neural</b> <b>Network</b> empowered trend analysis approach (ST-GTrend) to perform fleet-level performance degradation analysis for Photovoltaic (PV) power networks. PV power stations have become an integral component to the global sustainable energy production landscape. Accurately estimating the performance of PV systems is critical to their feasibility as a power generation technology and as a financial asset. One of the most challenging problems in assessing the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) of a PV system is to understand and estimate the long-term Performance Loss Rate (PLR) for large fleets of PV inverters. ST-GTrend integrates spatio-temporal coherence and <b>graph</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> separate PLR as a long-term "aging" trend from multiple fluctuation terms in the PV input data. To cope with diverse degradation patterns in timeseries, ST-GTrend adopts a paralleled <b>graph</b> <b>autoencoder</b> <b>array</b> to extract aging and fluctuation terms simultaneously. ST-GTrend imposes flatness and smoothness regularization to ensure the disentanglement between aging and fluctuation. To scale the analysis to large PV systems, we also introduce Para-GTrend, a parallel algorithm to accelerate the training and inference of ST-GTrend. We have evaluated ST-GTrend on three large-scale PV datasets, spanning a time period of 10 years. Our results show that ST-GTrend reduces Mean Absolute Percent Error (MAPE) and Euclidean Distances by 34.74% and 33.66% compared to the SOTA methods. Our results demonstrate that Para-GTrend can speed up ST-GTrend by up to 7.92 times. We further verify the generality and effectiveness of ST-GTrend for trend analysis using financial and economic datasets.

**ABSTRACT**  
Scientific computing using deep learning has seen significant advancements in recent years. There has been growing interest in models that learn the operator from the parameters of a partial differential equation (PDE) to the corresponding solutions. Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) and Fourier Neural operator, among other models, have been designed with structures suitable for handling functions as inputs and outputs, enabling real-time predictions as surrogate models for solution operators. There has also been significant progress in the research on surrogate models based on <b>graph</b> <b>neural</b> <b>networks</b> <b>(GNNs),</b> specifically targeting the dynamics in time-dependent PDEs. In this paper, we propose GraphDeepONet, an autoregressive model based on <b>GNNs,</b> to effectively adapt DeepONet, which is well-known for successful operator learning. GraphDeepONet exhibits robust accuracy in predicting solutions compared to existing <b>GNN-based</b> PDE solver models. It maintains consistent performance even on irregular grids, leveraging the advantages inherited from DeepONet and enabling predictions on arbitrary grids. Additionally, unlike traditional DeepONet and its variants, GraphDeepONet enables time extrapolation for time-dependent PDE solutions. We also provide theoretical analysis of the universal approximation capability of GraphDeepONet in approximating continuous operators across arbitrary time intervals.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recent advancements in generative models have established state-of-the-art <b>benchmarks</b> in generating molecules and novel drug candidates. Despite these successes, a significant gap persists between generative models and the utilization of extensive biomedical <b>knowledge,</b> <b>often</b> systematized within <b>knowledge</b> <b>graphs,</b> <b>whose</b> potential to inform and enhance generative processes has not been realized. In this paper, we present a novel approach that bridges this divide by developing a framework for <b>knowledge-enhanced</b> <b>generative</b> models called K-DReAM. We develop a scalable methodology to extend the functionality of <b>knowledge</b> <b>graphs</b> <b>while</b> preserving semantic integrity and incorporate this contextual information into a generative framework to guide a diffusion-based model. The integration of <b>knowledge</b> <b>graph</b> <b>embeddings</b> with our generative model furnishes a robust mechanism for producing novel drug candidates possessing specific characteristics while ensuring validity and synthesizability. K-DReAM outperforms state-of-the-art generative models on both unconditional and targeted generation tasks.

**ABSTRACT**  
The key premise of <b>federated</b> <b>learning</b> (FL) is to train ML models across a diverse set of data-owners (clients), without exchanging local data. An overarching challenge to this date is client heterogeneity, which may arise not only from variations in data distribution, but also in data quality, as well as compute/communication latency. An integrated view of these diverse and concurrent sources of heterogeneity is critical; for instance, low-latency clients may have poor data quality, and vice versa. In this work, we propose FLASH(Federated Learning Across Simultaneous Heterogeneities), a lightweight and flexible client selection algorithm that outperforms state-of-the-art FL frameworks under extensive sources of heterogeneity, by trading-off the statistical information associated with the client's data quality, data distribution, and latency. FLASH is the first method, to our knowledge, for handling all these heterogeneities in a unified manner. To do so, FLASH models the learning dynamics through contextual multi-armed <b>bandits</b> (CMAB) and dynamically selects the most promising clients. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that FLASH achieves substantial and consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines -- as much as 10% in absolute accuracy -- thanks to its unified approach. Importantly, FLASH also outperforms <b>federated</b> <b>aggregation</b> methods that are designed to handle highly heterogeneous settings and even enjoys a performance boost when integrated with them.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this work, we perform a systematic comparison of the effectiveness and efficiency of <b>generative</b> <b>and</b> <b>non-generative</b> models in constructing design spaces for novel and efficient design exploration and shape optimization. We apply these models in the case of airfoil/hydrofoil design and conduct the comparison on the resulting design spaces. A conventional <b>Generative</b> <b>Adversarial</b> <b>Network</b> <b>(GAN)</b> and a state-of-the-art <b>generative</b> <b>model,</b> <b>the</b> Performance-Augmented Diverse <b>Generative</b> <b>Adversarial</b> <b>Network</b> (PaDGAN), are juxtaposed with a linear non-generative model based on the coupling of the Karhunen-Lo\`eve Expansion and a physics-informed Shape Signature Vector (SSV-KLE). The comparison demonstrates that, with an appropriate shape encoding and a physics-augmented design space, non-generative models have the potential to cost-effectively generate high-performing valid designs with enhanced coverage of the design space. In this work, both approaches are applied to two large foil profile datasets comprising real-world and artificial designs generated through either a profile-generating parametric model or deep-learning approach. These datasets are further enriched with integral properties of their members' shapes as well as physics-informed parameters. Our results illustrate that the design spaces constructed by the non-generative model outperform the <b>generative</b> <b>model</b> <b>in</b> terms of design validity, generating robust latent spaces with none or significantly fewer invalid designs when compared to <b>generative</b> <b>models.</b> <b>We</b> aspire that these findings will aid the engineering design community in making informed decisions when constructing designs spaces for shape optimization, as we have show that under certain conditions computationally inexpensive approaches can closely match or even outperform state-of-the art generative models.

**ABSTRACT**  
We propose a new approach for propagating stable probability distributions through neural networks. Our method is based on local linearization, which we show to be an optimal approximation in terms of total variation distance for the ReLU non-linearity. This allows propagating Gaussian and Cauchy input uncertainties through neural networks to quantify their output uncertainties. To demonstrate the utility of propagating distributions, we apply the proposed method to predicting calibrated confidence intervals and <b>selective</b> <b>prediction</b> on <b>out-of-distribution</b> data. The results demonstrate a broad applicability of propagating distributions and show the advantages of our method over other approaches such as moment matching.

**ABSTRACT**  
Data cleansing aims to improve model performance by removing a set of harmful instances from the training dataset. Data Shapley is a common theoretically guaranteed method to evaluate the contribution of each instance to model performance; however, it requires training on all subsets of the training data, which is computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose an iterativemethod to fast identify a subset of instances with low data Shapley values by using the thresholding <b>bandit</b> <b>algorithm.</b> We provide a theoretical guarantee that the proposed method can accurately select harmful instances if a sufficiently large number of iterations is conducted. Empirical evaluation using various models and datasets demonstrated that the proposed method efficiently improved the computational speed while maintaining the model performance.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Graph</b> <b>neural</b> <b>networks</b> are architectures for learning invariant functions over <b>graphs.</b> <b>A</b> <b>large</b> body of work has investigated the properties of <b>graph</b> <b>neural</b> <b>networks</b> and identified several limitations, particularly pertaining to their expressive power. Their inability to count certain patterns (e.g., cycles) in a <b>graph</b> <b>lies</b> <b>at</b> the heart of such limitations, since many functions to be learned rely on the ability of counting such patterns. Two prominent paradigms aim to address this limitation by enriching the <b>graph</b> <b>features</b> <b>with</b> subgraph or homomorphism pattern counts. In this work, we show that both of these approaches are sub-optimal in a certain sense and argue for a more fine-grained approach, which incorporates the homomorphism counts of all structures in the "basis" of the target pattern. This yields strictly more expressive architectures without incurring any additional overhead in terms of computational complexity compared to existing approaches. We prove a series of theoretical results on node-level and <b>graph-level</b> <b>motif</b> <b>parameters</b> and empirically validate them on standard <b>benchmark</b> datasets.

**ABSTRACT**  
We investigate the problem of explainability in machine learning.To address this problem, Feature Attribution Methods (FAMs) measure the contribution of each feature through a perturbation test, where the difference in prediction is compared under different perturbations.However, such perturbation tests may not accurately distinguish the contributions of different features, when their change in prediction is the same after perturbation.In order to enhance the ability of FAMs to distinguish different features' contributions in this challenging setting, we propose to utilize the probability (PNS) that perturbing a feature is a necessary and sufficient cause for the prediction to change as a measure of feature importance.Our approach, Feature Attribution with Necessity and Sufficiency (FANS), computes the PNS via a perturbation test involving two stages (factual and interventional).In practice, to generate <b>counterfactual</b> samples, we use a resampling-based approach on the observed samples to approximate the required conditional distribution.Finally, we combine FANS and gradient-based optimization to extract the subset with the largest PNS.We demonstrate that FANS outperforms existing feature attribution methods on six <b>benchmarks.</b>

**ABSTRACT**  
In this paper, we present <b>"Graph</b> <b>Feature</b> <b>Preprocessor",</b> a software library for detecting typical money laundering and fraud patterns in financial transaction <b>graphs</b> <b>in</b> <b>real</b> time. These patterns are used to produce a rich set of transaction features for downstream machine learning training and inference tasks such as money laundering detection. We show that our enriched transaction features dramatically improve the prediction accuracy of gradient-boosting-based machine learning models. Our library exploits multicore parallelism, maintains a dynamic in-memory <b>graph,</b> <b>and</b> <b>efficiently</b> mines subgraph patterns in the incoming transaction stream, which enables it to be operated in a streaming manner. We evaluate our library using highly-imbalanced synthetic anti-money laundering (AML) and real-life Ethereum phishing datasets. In these datasets, the proportion of illicit transactions is very small, which makes the learning process challenging. Our solution, which combines our <b>Graph</b> <b>Feature</b> <b>Preprocessor</b> and gradient-boosting-based machine learning models, is able to detect these illicit transactions with higher minority-class F1 scores than standard <b>graph</b> <b>neural</b> <b>networks.</b> In addition, the end-to-end throughput rate of our solution executed on a multicore CPU outperforms the <b>graph</b> <b>neural</b> <b>network</b> baselines executed on a powerful V100 GPU. Overall, the combination of high accuracy, a high throughput rate, and low latency of our solution demonstrates the practical value of our library in real-world applications. <b>Graph</b> <b>Feature</b> <b>Preprocessor</b> has been integrated into IBM mainframe software products, namely "IBM Cloud Pak for Data on Z" and "AI Toolkit for IBM Z and LinuxONE".

**ABSTRACT**  
We introduce NeuRes, a neuro-symbolic proof-based SAT solver. Unlike other neural SAT solving methods, NeuRes is capable of proving unsatisfiability as opposed to merely predicting it. By design, NeuRes operates in a certificate-driven fashion by employing propositional resolution to prove unsatisfiability and to accelerate the process of finding satisfying truth assignments in case of unsat and sat formulas, respectively. To realize this, we propose a novel architecture that adapts elements from <b>Graph</b> <b>Neural</b> <b>Networks</b> and Pointer Networks to autoregressively select pairs of nodes from a dynamic <b>graph</b> <b>structure,</b> <b>which</b> is essential to the generation of resolution proofs. Our model is trained and evaluated on a dataset of teacher proofs and truth assignments that we compiled with the same random formula distribution used by NeuroSAT. In our experiments, we show that NeuRes solves more test formulas than NeuroSAT by a rather wide margin on different distributions while being much more data-efficient. Furthermore, we show that NeuRes is capable of largely shortening teacher proofs by notable proportions. We use this feature to devise a bootstrapped training procedure that manages to reduce a dataset of proofs generated by an advanced solver by ~23% after training on it with no extra guidance.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Continual</b> <b>learning</b> is the sequential learning of different tasks by a machine learning model. <b>Continual</b> <b>learning</b> is known to be hindered by catastrophic interference or forgetting, i.e. rapid unlearning of earlier learned tasks when new tasks are learned. Despite their practical success, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are prone to catastrophic interference. This study analyses how gradient descent and overlapping representations between distant input points lead to distal interference and catastrophic interference. Distal interference refers to the phenomenon where training a model on a subset of the domain leads to non-local changes on other subsets of the domain. This study shows that uniformly trainable models without distal interference must be exponentially large. A novel antisymmetric bounded exponential layer B-spline ANN architecture named ABEL-Spline is proposed that can approximate any continuous function, is uniformly trainable, has polynomial computational complexity, and provides some guarantees for distal interference. Experiments are presented to demonstrate the theoretical properties of ABEL-Splines. ABEL-Splines are also evaluated on <b>benchmark</b> regression problems. It is concluded that the weaker distal interference guarantees in ABEL-Splines are insufficient for model-only <b>continual</b> <b>learning.</b> It is conjectured that <b>continual</b> <b>learning</b> with polynomial complexity models requires augmentation of the training data or algorithm.

**ABSTRACT**  
Inner products of neural network feature maps arises in a wide variety of machine learning frameworks as a method of modeling relations between inputs. This work studies the approximation properties of inner products of neural networks. It is shown that the inner product of a multi-layer perceptron with itself is a universal approximator for symmetric positive-definite relation functions. In the case of asymmetric relation functions, it is shown that the inner product of two different multi-layer perceptrons is a universal approximator. In both cases, a bound is obtained on the number of neurons required to achieve a given accuracy of approximation. In the symmetric case, the function class can be identified with kernels of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, whereas in the asymmetric case the function class can be identified with kernels of reproducing kernel Banach spaces. Finally, these approximation results are applied to analyzing the attention mechanism underlying <b>Transformers,</b> showing that any retrieval mechanism defined by an abstract preorder can be approximated by attention through its inner product relations. This result uses the Debreu representation theorem in economics to represent preference relations in terms of utility functions.

**ABSTRACT**  
The inverse <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning</b> approach to imitation learning is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it can enable learning from a smaller number of expert demonstrations with more robustness to error compounding than behavioral cloning approaches. On the other hand, it requires that the learner repeatedly solve a computationally expensive <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning</b> (RL) problem. Often, much of this computation is wasted searching over policies very dissimilar to the expert's. In this work, we propose using hybrid RL -- training on a mixture of online and expert data -- to curtail unnecessary exploration. Intuitively, the expert data focuses the learner on good states during training, which reduces the amount of exploration required to compute a strong policy. Notably, such an approach doesn't need the ability to reset the learner to arbitrary states in the environment, a requirement of prior work in efficient inverse RL. More formally, we derive a reduction from inverse RL to expert-competitive RL (rather than globally optimal RL) that allows us to dramatically reduce interaction during the inner policy search loop while maintaining the benefits of the IRL approach. This allows us to derive both model-free and model-based hybrid inverse RL algorithms with strong policy performance guarantees. Empirically, we find that our approaches are significantly more sample efficient than standard inverse RL and several other baselines on a suite of continuous control tasks.

**ABSTRACT**  
We consider the setting of online convex optimization with adversarial time-varying constraints in which actions must be feasible w.r.t. a fixed constraint set, and are also required on average to approximately satisfy additional time-varying constraints. Motivated by scenarios in which the fixed feasible set (hard constraint) is difficult to project on, we consider projection-free algorithms that access this set only through a linear optimization oracle (LOO). We present an algorithm that, on a sequence of length $T$ and using overall $T$ calls to the LOO, guarantees $\tilde{O}(T^{3/4})$ regret w.r.t. the losses and $O(T^{7/8})$ constraints violation (ignoring all quantities except for $T$) . In particular, these bounds hold w.r.t. any interval of the sequence. We also present a more efficient algorithm that requires only first-order oracle access to the soft constraints and achieves similar bounds w.r.t. the entire sequence. We extend the latter to the setting of <b>bandit</b> feedback and obtain similar bounds (as a function of $T$) in expectation.

**ABSTRACT**  
In strategic classification, agents modify their features, at a cost, to ideally obtain a positive classification from the learner's classifier. The typical response of the learner is to carefully modify their classifier to be robust to such strategic behavior. When <b>reasoning</b> about agent manipulations, most papers that study strategic classification rely on the following strong assumption: agents fully know the exact parameters of the deployed classifier by the learner. This often is an unrealistic assumption when using complex or proprietary machine learning techniques in real-world prediction tasks. We initiate the study of partial information release by the learner in strategic classification. We move away from the traditional assumption that agents have full knowledge of the classifier. Instead, we consider agents that have a common distributional prior on which classifier the learner is using. The learner in our model can reveal truthful, yet not necessarily complete, information about the deployed classifier to the agents. The learner's goal is to release just enough information about the classifier to maximize accuracy. We show how such partial information release can, counter-intuitively, benefit the learner's accuracy, despite increasing agents' abilities to manipulate. We show that while it is intractable to compute the best response of an agent in the general case, there exist oracle-efficient algorithms that can solve the best response of the agents when the learner's hypothesis class is the class of linear classifiers, or when the agents' cost function satisfies a natural notion of submodularity as we define. We then turn our attention to the learner's optimization problem and provide both positive and negative results on the algorithmic problem of how much information the learner should release about the classifier to maximize their expected accuracy.

**ABSTRACT**  
Quantum Machine Learning (QML) has emerged as a promising field of research, aiming to leverage the capabilities of quantum computing to enhance existing machine learning methodologies. Recent studies have revealed that, like their classical counterparts, QML models based on Parametrized Quantum Circuits (PQCs) are also vulnerable to <b>adversarial</b> <b>attacks.</b> Moreover, the existence of Universal <b>Adversarial</b> <b>Perturbations</b> (UAPs) in the quantum domain has been demonstrated theoretically in the context of quantum classifiers. In this work, we introduce QuGAP: a novel framework for generating UAPs for quantum classifiers. We conceptualize the notion of additive UAPs for PQC-based classifiers and theoretically demonstrate their existence. We then utilize generative models (QuGAP-A) to craft additive UAPs and experimentally show that quantum classifiers are susceptible to such attacks. Moreover, we formulate a new method for generating unitary UAPs (QuGAP-U) using quantum generative models and a novel loss function based on fidelity constraints. We evaluate the performance of the proposed framework and show that our method achieves state-of-the-art misclassification rates, while maintaining high fidelity between legitimate and <b>adversarial</b> <b>samples.</b>

**ABSTRACT**  
In this paper, we analyze the problem of online convex optimization in different settings. We show that any algorithm for online linear optimization with fully adaptive adversaries is an algorithm for online convex optimization. We also show that any such algorithm that requires full-information feedback may be transformed to an algorithm with semi-bandit feedback with comparable regret bound. We further show that algorithms that are designed for fully adaptive adversaries using deterministic semi-bandit feedback can obtain similar bounds using only stochastic semi-bandit feedback when facing oblivious adversaries. We use this to describe general meta-algorithms to convert first order algorithms to zeroth order algorithms with comparable regret bounds. Our framework allows us to analyze online optimization in various settings, such full-information feedback, <b>bandit</b> feedback, stochastic regret, adversarial regret and various forms of non-stationary regret. Using our analysis, we provide the first efficient projection-free online convex optimization algorithm using linear optimization oracles.

**ABSTRACT**  
Existing work in <b>fairness</b> audits assumes that agents operate independently. In this paper, we consider the case of multiple agents auditing the same platform for different tasks. Agents have two levers: their collaboration strategy, with or without coordination beforehand, and their sampling method. We theoretically study their interplay when agents operate independently or collaborate. We prove that, surprisingly, coordination can sometimes be detrimental to audit accuracy, whereas uncoordinated collaboration generally yields good results. Experimentation on real-world datasets confirms this observation, as the audit accuracy of uncoordinated collaboration matches that of collaborative optimal sampling.

**ABSTRACT**  
Autonomous vehicles have to obey traffic rules. These rules are often formalized using temporal logic, resulting in constraints that are hard to solve using optimization-based motion planners. <b>Reinforcement</b> <b>Learning</b> (RL) is a promising method to find motion plans adhering to temporal logic specifications. However, vanilla RL algorithms are based on random exploration, which is inherently unsafe. To address this issue, we propose a provably safe RL approach that always complies with traffic rules. As a specific application area, we consider vessels on the open sea, which must adhere to the Convention on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGS). We introduce an efficient verification approach that determines the compliance of actions with respect to the COLREGS formalized using temporal logic. Our action verification is integrated into the RL process so that the agent only selects verified actions. In contrast to agents that only integrate the traffic rule information in the reward function, our provably safe agent always complies with the formalized rules in critical maritime traffic situations and, thus, never causes a collision.

**ABSTRACT**  
Cellular reprogramming can be used for both the prevention and cure of different diseases. However, the efficiency of discovering reprogramming strategies with classical wet-lab experiments is hindered by lengthy time commitments and high costs. In this study, we develop a~novel computational framework based on deep <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning</b> that facilitates the identification of reprogramming strategies. For this aim, we formulate a~control problem in the context of cellular reprogramming for the frameworks of BNs and PBNs under the asynchronous update mode. Furthermore, we introduce the notion of a~pseudo-attractor and a~procedure for identification of pseudo-attractor state during training. Finally, we devise a~computational framework for solving the control problem, which we test on a~number of different models.

**ABSTRACT**  
Digital twin (DT) platforms are increasingly regarded as a promising technology for controlling, optimizing, and monitoring complex engineering systems such as next-generation wireless networks. An important challenge in adopting DT solutions is their reliance on data collected offline, lacking direct access to the physical environment. This limitation is particularly severe in multi-agent systems, for which conventional multi-agent <b>reinforcement</b> <b>(MARL)</b> requires online interactions with the environment. A direct application of online MARL schemes to an offline setting would generally fail due to the epistemic uncertainty entailed by the limited availability of data. In this work, we propose an offline MARL scheme for DT-based wireless networks that integrates distributional RL and conservative Q-learning to address the environment's inherent aleatoric uncertainty and the epistemic uncertainty arising from limited data. To further exploit the offline data, we adapt the proposed scheme to the centralized training decentralized execution framework, allowing joint training of the agents' policies. The proposed MARL scheme, referred to as multi-agent conservative quantile regression (MA-CQR) addresses general risk-sensitive design criteria and is applied to the trajectory planning problem in drone networks, showcasing its advantages.

**ABSTRACT**  
Bayesian optimization is a methodology to optimize black-box functions. Traditionally, it focuses on the setting where you can arbitrarily query the search space. However, many real-life problems do not offer this flexibility; in particular, the search space of the next query may depend on previous ones. Example challenges arise in the physical sciences in the form of local movement constraints, required monotonicity in certain variables, and transitions influencing the accuracy of measurements. Altogether, such transition constraints necessitate a form of planning. This work extends Bayesian optimization via the framework of Markov Decision Processes, iteratively solving a tractable linearization of our objective using <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning</b> to obtain a policy that plans ahead over long horizons. The resulting policy is potentially history-dependent and non-Markovian. We showcase applications in chemical reactor optimization, informative path planning, machine calibration, and other synthetic examples.

**ABSTRACT**  
The wide availability of specific courses together with the flexibility of academic plans in university studies reveal the importance of <b>Recommendation</b> Systems (RSs) in this area. These systems appear as tools that help students to choose courses that suit to their personal interests and their academic performance. This paper presents a hybrid RS that combines Collaborative Filtering (CF) and Content-based Filtering (CBF) using multiple criteria related both to student and course information to recommend the most suitable courses to the students. A Genetic Algorithm (GA) has been developed to automatically discover the optimal RS configuration which include both the most relevant criteria and the configuration of the rest of parameters. The experimental study has used real information of Computer Science Degree of University of Cordoba (Spain) including information gathered from students during three academic years, counting on 2500 entries of 95 students and 63 courses. Experimental results show a study of the most relevant criteria for the course <b>recommendation,</b> the importance of using a hybrid model that combines both student information and course information to increase the reliability of the <b>recommendations</b> as well as an excellent performance compared to previous models.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Counterfactual</b> explanations provide a popular method for analyzing the predictions of black-box systems, and they can offer the opportunity for computational recourse by suggesting actionable changes on how to change the input to obtain a different (i.e. more favorable) system output. However, recent work highlighted their vulnerability to different types of manipulations. This work studies the vulnerability of <b>counterfactual</b> explanations to data poisoning. We formalize data poisoning in the context of <b>counterfactual</b> explanations for increasing the cost of recourse on three different levels: locally for a single instance, or a sub-group of instances, or globally for all instances. We demonstrate that state-of-the-art <b>counterfactual</b> generation methods \& toolboxes are vulnerable to such data poisoning.

**ABSTRACT**  
Symmetric Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (SymNMF) is a technique in data analysis and machine learning that approximates a symmetric matrix with a product of a nonnegative, low-rank matrix and its transpose. To design faster and more scalable algorithms for SymNMF we develop two randomized algorithms for its computation. The first algorithm uses randomized matrix sketching to compute an initial low-rank input matrix and proceeds to use this input to rapidly compute a SymNMF. The second algorithm uses randomized leverage score sampling to approximately solve constrained least squares problems. Many successful methods for SymNMF rely on (approximately) solving sequences of constrained least squares problems. We prove theoretically that leverage score sampling can approximately solve nonnegative least squares problems to a chosen accuracy with high probability. Finally we demonstrate that both methods work well in practice by applying them to <b>graph</b> <b>clustering</b> tasks on large real world data sets. These experiments show that our methods approximately maintain solution quality and achieve significant speed ups for both large dense and large sparse problems.

**ABSTRACT**  
Causal <b>graph</b> discovery is a significant problem with applications across various disciplines. However, with observational data alone, the underlying causal <b>graph</b> can only be recovered up to its Markov equivalence class, and further assumptions or interventions are necessary to narrow down the true <b>graph.</b> This work addresses the causal discovery problem under the setting of stochastic interventions with the natural goal of minimizing the number of interventions performed. We propose the following stochastic intervention model which subsumes existing adaptive noiseless interventions in the literature while capturing scenarios such as fat-hand interventions and CRISPR gene knockouts: any intervention attempt results in an actual intervention on a random subset of vertices, drawn from a distribution dependent on attempted action. Under this model, we study the two fundamental problems in causal discovery of verification and search and provide approximation algorithms with polylogarithmic competitive ratios and provide some preliminary experimental results.

**ABSTRACT**  
Large Language Models~(LLMs) have gained immense popularity and are being increasingly applied in various domains. Consequently, ensuring the security of these models is of paramount importance. Jailbreak attacks, which manipulate <b>LLMs</b> to generate malicious content, are recognized as a significant vulnerability. While existing research has predominantly focused on direct jailbreak attacks on <b>LLMs,</b> there has been limited exploration of indirect methods. The integration of various plugins into <b>LLMs,</b> notably <b>Retrieval</b> <b>Augmented</b> <b>Generation~(RAG),</b> which enables <b>LLMs</b> to incorporate external knowledge bases into their response generation such as <b>GPTs,</b> introduces new avenues for indirect jailbreak attacks. To fill this gap, we investigate indirect jailbreak attacks on <b>LLMs,</b> particularly <b>GPTs,</b> introducing a novel attack vector named <b>Retrieval</b> <b>Augmented</b> <b>Generation</b> Poisoning. This method, Pandora, exploits the synergy between <b>LLMs</b> and <b>RAG</b> through <b>prompt</b> manipulation to generate unexpected responses. Pandora uses maliciously crafted content to influence the <b>RAG</b> process, effectively initiating jailbreak attacks. Our preliminary tests show that Pandora successfully conducts jailbreak attacks in four different scenarios, achieving higher success rates than direct attacks, with 64.3\% for <b>GPT-3.5</b> and 34.8\% for <b>GPT-4.</b>

**ABSTRACT**  
Reconstruction attacks and defenses are essential in understanding the data leakage problem in machine learning. However, prior work has centered around empirical observations of gradient inversion attacks, lacks theoretical <b>groundings,</b> and was unable to disentangle the usefulness of defending methods versus the computational limitation of attacking methods. In this work, we propose a strong reconstruction attack in the setting of <b>federated</b> <b>learning.</b> The attack reconstructs intermediate features and nicely integrates with and outperforms most of the previous methods. On this stronger attack, we thoroughly investigate both theoretically and empirically the effect of the most common defense methods. Our findings suggest that among various defense mechanisms, such as gradient clipping, dropout, additive noise, local aggregation, etc., gradient <b>pruning</b> emerges as the most effective strategy to defend against state-of-the-art attacks.

**ABSTRACT**  
We present Cryptomite, a Python library of randomness extractor implementations. The library offers a range of two-source, seeded and deterministic randomness extractors, together with parameter calculation modules, making it easy to use and suitable for a variety of applications. We also present theoretical results, including new extractor constructions and improvements to existing extractor parameters. The extractor implementations are efficient in practice and tolerate input sizes of up to $2^{40} > 10^{12}$ bits. They are also numerically precise (implementing <b>convolutions</b> using the Number Theoretic Transform to avoid floating point arithmetic), making them well suited to cryptography. The algorithms and parameter calculation are described in detail, including illustrative code examples and performance <b>benchmarking.</b>

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Zero</b> <b>Trust</b> security has recently gained attention in enterprise network security. One of its key ideas is making network-level access decisions based on trust scores. However, score-based access control in the enterprise domain still lacks essential elements in our understanding, and in this paper, we contribute with respect to three crucial aspects. First, we provide a comprehensive list of 29 trust attributes that can be used to calculate a trust score. By introducing a novel mathematical approach, we demonstrate how to quantify these attributes. Second, we describe a dynamic risk-based method to calculate the trust threshold the trust score must meet for permitted access. Third, we introduce a novel trust algorithm based on Subjective Logic that incorporates the first two contributions and offers fine-grained decision possibilities. We discuss how this algorithm shows a higher expressiveness compared to a lightweight additive trust algorithm. Performance-wise, a prototype of the Subjective Logic-based approach showed similar calculation times for making an access decision as the additive approach. In addition, the dynamic threshold calculation showed only 7% increased decision-making times compared to a static threshold.

**ABSTRACT**  
Biometric systems based on brain activity have been proposed as an alternative to passwords or to complement current authentication techniques. By leveraging the unique brainwave patterns of individuals, these systems offer the possibility of creating authentication solutions that are resistant to theft, hands-free, accessible, and potentially even revocable. However, despite the growing stream of research in this area, faster advance is hindered by reproducibility problems. Issues such as the lack of standard reporting schemes for performance results and system configuration, or the absence of common evaluation <b>benchmarks,</b> make comparability and proper assessment of different biometric solutions challenging. Further, barriers are erected to future work when, as so often, source code is not published open access. To bridge this gap, we introduce NeuroBench, a flexible open source tool to <b>benchmark</b> brainwave-based authentication models. It incorporates nine diverse datasets, implements a comprehensive set of pre-processing parameters and machine learning algorithms, enables testing under two common adversary models (known vs unknown attacker), and allows researchers to generate full performance reports and visualizations. We use NeuroBench to investigate the shallow classifiers and deep learning-based approaches proposed in the literature, and to test robustness across multiple sessions. We observe a 37.6% reduction in Equal Error Rate (EER) for unknown attacker scenarios (typically not tested in the literature), and we highlight the importance of session variability to brainwave authentication. All in all, our results demonstrate the viability and relevance of NeuroBench in streamlining fair comparisons of algorithms, thereby furthering the advancement of brainwave-based authentication through robust methodological practices.

**ABSTRACT**  
Robotic planning algorithms direct agents to perform actions within diverse environments to accomplish a task. <b>Large</b> <b>Language</b> <b>Models</b> <b>(LLMs)</b> like <b>PaLM</b> 2, <b>GPT-3.5,</b> and <b>GPT-4</b> have revolutionized this domain, using their embedded real-world knowledge to tackle complex tasks involving multiple agents and objects. This paper introduces an innovative planning algorithm that integrates <b>LLMs</b> into the robotics context, enhancing task-focused execution and success rates. Key to our algorithm is a closed-loop feedback which provides real-time environmental states and error messages, crucial for refining plans when discrepancies arise. The algorithm draws inspiration from the human neural system, emulating its brain-body architecture by dividing planning across two <b>LLMs</b> in a structured, hierarchical fashion. Our method not only surpasses baselines within the VirtualHome Environment, registering a notable 35% average increase in task-oriented success rates, but achieves an impressive execution score of 85%, approaching the human-level <b>benchmark</b> of 94%. Moreover, effectiveness of the algorithm in real robot scenarios is shown using a realistic physics simulator and the Franka Research 3 Arm.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Foundation</b> <b>models</b> have recently expanded into robotics after excelling in computer vision and natural language processing. The models are accessible in two ways: open-source or paid, closed-source options. Users with access to both face a problem when deciding between effective yet costly closed-source models and free but less powerful open-source alternatives. We call it the model selection problem. Existing <b>supervised-learning</b> <b>methods</b> are impractical due to the high cost of collecting extensive training data from closed-source models. Hence, we focus on the online learning setting where algorithms learn while collecting data, eliminating the need for large pre-collected datasets. We thus formulate a user-centric online model selection problem and propose a novel solution that combines an open-source encoder to output context and an online learning algorithm that processes this context. The encoder <b>distills</b> vast data distributions into low-dimensional features, i.e., the context, without additional training. The online learning algorithm aims to maximize a composite reward that includes model performance, execution time, and costs based on the context extracted from the data. It results in an improved trade-off between selecting open-source and closed-source models compared to non-contextual methods, as validated by our theoretical analysis. Experiments across language-based robotic tasks such as Waymo Open Dataset, ALFRED, and Open X-Embodiment demonstrate real-world applications of the solution. The results show that the solution significantly improves the task success rate by up to 14%.

**ABSTRACT**  
To realize effective large-scale, real-world robotic applications, we must evaluate how well our robot policies adapt to changes in environmental conditions. Unfortunately, a majority of studies evaluate robot performance in environments closely resembling or even identical to the training setup. We present THE COLOSSEUM, a novel <b>simulation</b> <b>benchmark,</b> with 20 diverse manipulation tasks, that enables systematical evaluation of models across 12 axes of environmental perturbations. These perturbations include changes in color, texture, and size of objects, table-tops, and backgrounds; we also vary lighting, distractors, and camera pose. Using THE COLOSSEUM, we compare 4 state-of-the-art manipulation models to reveal that their success rate degrades between 30-50% across these perturbation factors. When multiple perturbations are applied in unison, the success rate degrades $\geq$75%. We identify that changing the number of distractor objects, target object color, or lighting conditions are the perturbations that reduce model performance the most. To verify the ecological validity of our results, we show that our results in <b>simulation</b> are correlated ($\bar{R}^2 = 0.614$) to similar perturbations in real-world experiments. We open source code for others to use THE COLOSSEUM, and also release code to 3D print the objects used to replicate the real-world perturbations. Ultimately, we hope that THE COLOSSEUM will serve as a <b>benchmark</b> to identify modeling decisions that systematically improve generalization for manipulation.

**ABSTRACT**  
Multi-robot systems must have the ability to accurately estimate relative states between robots in order to perform collaborative tasks, possibly with no external aiding. Three-dimensional relative pose estimation using range measurements oftentimes suffers from a finite number of non-unique solutions, or ambiguities. This paper: 1) identifies and accurately estimates all possible ambiguities in 2D; 2) treats them as components of a Gaussian mixture model; and 3) presents a computationally-efficient estimator, in the form of a Gaussian-sum filter (GSF), to realize range-based relative pose estimation in an infrastructure-free, 3D, setup. This estimator is evaluated in <b>simulation</b> and experiment and is shown to avoid divergence to local minima induced by the ambiguous poses. Furthermore, the proposed GSF outperforms an extended Kalman filter, demonstrates similar performance to the computationally-demanding particle filter, and is shown to be consistent.

**ABSTRACT**  
Many existing obstacle avoidance algorithms overlook the crucial balance between safety and agility, especially in environments of varying complexity. In our study, we introduce an obstacle avoidance pipeline based on <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning.</b> This pipeline enables drones to adapt their flying speed according to the environmental complexity. Moreover, to improve the obstacle avoidance performance in cluttered environments, we propose a novel latent space. The latent space in this representation is explicitly trained to retain memory of previous depth map observations. Our findings confirm that varying speed leads to a superior balance of success rate and agility in cluttered environments. Additionally, our memory-augmented latent representation outperforms the latent representation commonly used in <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning.</b> Finally, after minimal <b>fine-tuning,</b> we successfully deployed our network on a real drone for enhanced obstacle avoidance.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper presents the design and implementation of a self-reconfigurable V-shape formation controller for multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) navigating through narrow spaces in a dense obstacle environment. The selection of the V-shape formation is motivated by its maneuverability and visibility advantages. The main objective is to develop an effective formation control strategy that allows UAVs to autonomously adjust their positions to form the desired formation while navigating through obstacles. To achieve this, we propose a distributed behavior-based control algorithm that combines the behaviors designed for individual UAVs so that they together navigate the UAVs to their desired positions. The reconfiguration process is automatic, utilizing individual UAV sensing within the formation, allowing for dynamic adaptations such as opening/closing wings or merging into a straight line. <b>Simulation</b> results show that the self-reconfigurable V-shape formation offers adaptability and effectiveness for UAV formations in complex operational scenarios.

**ABSTRACT**  
Trajectory prediction has garnered widespread attention in different fields, such as autonomous driving and robotic navigation. However, due to the significant variations in trajectory patterns across different scenarios, models trained in known environments often falter in unseen ones. To learn a generalized model that can directly handle unseen domains without requiring any model updating, we propose a novel <b>meta-learning-based</b> <b>trajectory</b> prediction method called MetaTra. This approach incorporates a Dual Trajectory <b>Transformer</b> (Dual-TT), which enables a thorough exploration of the individual intention and the interactions within group motion patterns in diverse scenarios. Building on this, we propose a <b>meta-learning</b> <b>framework</b> to simulate the generalization process between source and target domains. Furthermore, to enhance the stability of our prediction outcomes, we propose a Serial and Parallel Training (SPT) strategy along with a feature augmentation method named MetaMix. Experimental results on several real-world datasets confirm that MetaTra not only surpasses other state-of-the-art methods but also exhibits plug-and-play capabilities, particularly in the realm of domain generalization.

**ABSTRACT**  
Embodied agents capable of complex physical skills can improve productivity, elevate life quality, and reshape human-machine collaboration. We aim at autonomous training of embodied agents for various tasks involving mainly large <b>foundation</b> <b>models.</b> It is believed that these models could act as a brain for embodied agents; however, existing methods heavily rely on humans for task proposal and scene customization, limiting the learning autonomy, training efficiency, and generalization of the learned policies. In contrast, we introduce a brain-body synchronization ({\it BBSEA}) scheme to promote embodied learning in unknown environments without human involvement. The proposed combines the wisdom of <b>foundation</b> <b>models</b> (``brain'') with the physical capabilities of embodied agents (``body''). Specifically, it leverages the ``brain'' to propose learnable physical tasks and success metrics, enabling the ``body'' to automatically acquire various skills by continuously interacting with the scene. We carry out an exploration of the proposed autonomous learning scheme in a table-top setting, and we demonstrate that the proposed synchronization can generate diverse tasks and develop multi-task policies with promising adaptability to new tasks and configurations. We will release our data, code, and trained models to facilitate future studies in building autonomously learning agents with large <b>foundation</b> <b>models</b> in more complex scenarios.

**ABSTRACT**  
We consider the problem of finding an informative path through a <b>graph,</b> given initial and terminal nodes and a given maximum path length. We assume that a linear noise corrupted measurement is taken at each node of an underlying unknown vector that we wish to estimate. The informativeness is measured by the reduction in uncertainty in our estimate, evaluated using several metrics. We present a convex relaxation for this informative path planning problem, which we can readily solve to obtain a bound on the possible performance. We develop an approximate sequential method where the path is constructed segment by segment through dynamic programming. This involves solving an orienteering problem, with the node reward acting as a surrogate for informativeness, taking the first step, and then repeating the process. The method scales to very large problem instances and achieves performance not too far from the bound produced by the convex relaxation. We also demonstrate our method's ability to handle adaptive objectives, <b>multimodal</b> sensing, and multi-agent variations of the informative path planning problem.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Vision-Language</b> Models (VLMs), such as Flamingo and <b>GPT-4V,</b> have shown immense potential by integrating <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> with vision systems. Nevertheless, these models face challenges in the fundamental computer vision task of object localisation, due to their training on <b>multimodal</b> data containing mostly captions without explicit spatial <b>grounding.</b> While it is possible to construct custom, <b>supervised</b> training pipelines with bounding box annotations that integrate with VLMs, these result in specialized and hard-to-scale models. In this paper, we aim to explore the limits of caption-based VLMs and instead propose to tackle the challenge in a simpler manner by i) keeping the weights of a caption-based VLM frozen and ii) not using any <b>supervised</b> detection data. To this end, we introduce an input-agnostic Positional Insert (PIN), a learnable spatial <b>prompt,</b> containing a minimal set of parameters that are slid inside the frozen VLM, unlocking object localisation capabilities. Our PIN module is trained with a simple next-token prediction task on synthetic data without requiring the introduction of new output heads. Our experiments demonstrate strong <b>zero-shot</b> localisation performances on a variety of images, including Pascal VOC, COCO, LVIS, and diverse images like paintings or cartoons.

**ABSTRACT**  
Having revolutionized natural language processing (NLP) applications, <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> <b>(LLMs)</b> are expanding into the realm of <b>multimodal</b> inputs. Owing to their ability to interpret images, <b>multimodal</b> <b>LLMs</b> (MLLMs) have been primarily used for <b>vision-language</b> tasks. Currently, MLLMs have not yet been extended for domain-specific <b>visual</b> <b>tasks,</b> <b>which</b> require a more explicit understanding of <b>visual</b> <b>information.</b> <b>We</b> developed a method to transform domain-specific <b>visual</b> <b>and</b> <b>vision-language</b> datasets into a unified <b>question</b> <b>answering</b> format called <b>Visual</b> <b>Question</b> <b>Answering</b> Instruction <b>(VQA-IN),</b> thereby extending MLLM to domain-specific tasks. The <b>VQA-IN</b> was applied to train multiple MLLM architectures using smaller versions of <b>LLMs</b> (sLLMs). The experimental results indicated that the proposed method achieved a high score metric on domainspecific <b>visual</b> <b>tasks</b> <b>while</b> also maintaining its performance on <b>vision-language</b> tasks in a multitask manner.

**ABSTRACT**  
The accurate segmentation of medical images is critical for various healthcare applications. <b>Convolutional</b> <b>neural</b> <b>networks</b> <b>(CNNs),</b> especially Fully <b>Convolutional</b> <b>Networks</b> <b>(FCNs)</b> like U-Net, have shown remarkable success in medical image segmentation tasks. However, they have limitations in capturing global context and long-range relations, especially for objects with significant variations in shape, scale, and texture. While <b>transformers</b> have achieved state-of-the-art results in natural language processing and image recognition, they face challenges in medical image segmentation due to image locality and translational invariance issues. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an innovative U-shaped network called BEFUnet, which enhances the fusion of body and edge <b>information</b> <b>for</b> precise medical image segmentation. The BEFUnet comprises three main modules, including a novel Local Cross-Attention Feature (LCAF) fusion module, a novel Double-Level Fusion (DLF) module, and dual-branch encoder. The dual-branch encoder consists of an edge encoder and a body encoder. The edge encoder employs PDC blocks for effective edge <b>information</b> <b>extraction,</b> while the body encoder uses the Swin <b>Transformer</b> to capture semantic <b>information</b> <b>with</b> global attention. The LCAF module efficiently fuses edge and body features by selectively performing local cross-attention on features that are spatially close between the two modalities. This local approach significantly reduces computational complexity compared to global cross-attention while ensuring accurate feature matching. BEFUnet demonstrates superior performance over existing methods across various evaluation metrics on medical image segmentation datasets.

**ABSTRACT**  
In recent years, synthetic <b>visual</b> <b>instructions</b> <b>by</b> generative language model have demonstrated plausible <b>text</b> <b>generation</b> performance on the <b>visual</b> <b>question-answering</b> <b>tasks.</b> However, challenges persist in the hallucination of generative language models, i.e., the generated <b>image-text</b> data contains unintended contents. This paper presents a novel and scalable method for generating visually dehallucinative <b>instructions,</b> <b>dubbed</b> CAP2QA, that constrains the scope to only image contents. Our key contributions lie in introducing image-aligned instructive <b>QA</b> dataset CAP2QA-COCO and its scalable recipe. In our experiments, we compare synthetic <b>visual</b> <b>instruction</b> <b>datasets</b> that share the same source data by <b>visual</b> <b>instruction</b> <b>tuning</b> and conduct general <b>visual</b> <b>recognition</b> <b>tasks.</b> It shows that our proposed method significantly reduces <b>visual</b> <b>hallucination</b> <b>while</b> consistently improving <b>visual</b> <b>recognition</b> <b>ability</b> and expressiveness.

**ABSTRACT**  
In recent years, driven by the need for safer and more autonomous transport systems, the automotive industry has shifted toward integrating a growing number of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). Among the array of sensors employed for <b>object</b> <b>recognition</b> tasks, radar sensors have emerged as a formidable contender due to their abilities in adverse weather conditions or low-light scenarios and their robustness in maintaining consistent performance across diverse environments. However, the small size of radar datasets and the complexity of the labelling of those data limit the performance of radar <b>object</b> <b>detectors.</b> Driven by the promising results of <b>self-supervised</b> <b>learning</b> in computer vision, this paper presents RiCL, an instance <b>contrastive</b> <b>learning</b> framework to pre-train radar <b>object</b> <b>detectors.</b> We propose to exploit the detection from the radar and the temporal information to pre-train the radar <b>object</b> <b>detection</b> model in a <b>self-supervised</b> <b>way</b> using <b>contrastive</b> <b>learning.</b> We aim to pre-train an <b>object</b> <b>detector's</b> backbone, head and neck to learn with fewer data. Experiments on the CARRADA and the RADDet datasets show the effectiveness of our approach in learning generic representations of <b>objects</b> <b>in</b> range-Doppler maps. Notably, our pre-training strategy allows us to use only 20% of the labelled data to reach a similar mAP@0.5 than a <b>supervised</b> approach using the whole training set.

**ABSTRACT**  
The utilization of residual learning has become widespread in deep and scalable neural nets. However, the fundamental principles that contribute to the success of residual learning remain elusive, thus hindering effective training of plain nets with depth scalability. In this paper, we peek behind the curtains of residual learning by uncovering the "dissipating inputs" phenomenon that leads to convergence failure in plain neural nets: the input is gradually compromised through plain layers due to non-linearities, resulting in challenges of learning feature representations. We theoretically demonstrate how plain neural nets degenerate the input to random noise and emphasize the significance of a residual connection that maintains a better lower bound of surviving neurons as a solution. With our theoretical discoveries, we propose "The Plain Neural Net Hypothesis" (PNNH) that identifies the internal path across non-linear layers as the most critical part in residual learning, and establishes a paradigm to support the training of deep plain neural nets devoid of residual connections. We thoroughly evaluate PNNH-enabled <b>CNN</b> architectures and <b>Transformers</b> on popular <b>vision</b> <b>benchmarks,</b> showing on-par accuracy, up to 0.3% higher training throughput, and 2x better parameter efficiency compared to ResNets and <b>vision</b> <b>Transformers.</b>

**ABSTRACT**  
Over the past years, image generation and manipulation have achieved remarkable progress due to the rapid development of <b>generative</b> <b>AI</b> <b>based</b> on deep learning. Recent studies have devoted significant efforts to address the problem of face image manipulation caused by deepfake techniques. However, the problem of detecting purely synthesized face images has been explored to a lesser extent. In particular, the recent popular Diffusion Models (DMs) have shown remarkable success in image synthesis. Existing detectors struggle to generalize between synthesized images created by different <b>generative</b> <b>models.</b> <b>In</b> this work, a comprehensive <b>benchmark</b> including human face images produced by <b>Generative</b> <b>Adversarial</b> <b>Networks</b> <b>(GANs)</b> and a variety of DMs has been established to evaluate both the generalization ability and robustness of state-of-the-art detectors. Then, the forgery traces introduced by different <b>generative</b> <b>models</b> <b>have</b> been analyzed in the frequency domain to draw various insights. The paper further demonstrates that a detector trained with frequency representation can generalize well to other unseen <b>generative</b> <b>models.</b>

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Transformer-based</b> models have dominated natural language processing and other areas in the last few years due to their superior <b>(zero-shot)</b> performance on <b>benchmark</b> datasets. However, these models are poorly understood due to their complexity and size. While probing-based methods are widely used to understand specific properties, the structures of the representation space are not systematically characterized; consequently, it is unclear how such models generalize and overgeneralize to new inputs beyond datasets. In this paper, based on a new gradient descent optimization method, we are able to explore the embedding space of a commonly used <b>vision-language</b> model. Using the Imagenette dataset, we show that while the model achieves over 99\% <b>zero-shot</b> classification performance, it fails systematic evaluations completely. Using a linear approximation, we provide a framework to explain the striking differences. We have also obtained similar results using a different model to support that our results are applicable to other <b>transformer</b> models with continuous inputs. We also propose a robust way to detect the modified images.

**ABSTRACT**  
Quality assessment, including inspecting the images for artifacts, is a critical step during MRI data acquisition to ensure data quality and downstream analysis or interpretation success. This study demonstrates a deep learning model to detect rigid motion in T1-weighted brain images. We leveraged a 2D <b>CNN</b> for three-class classification and tested it on publicly available retrospective and prospective datasets. Grad-CAM heatmaps enabled the identification of failure modes and provided an interpretation of the model's results. The model achieved average precision and recall metrics of 85% and 80% on six motion-simulated retrospective datasets. Additionally, the model's classifications on the prospective dataset showed a strong inverse correlation (-0.84) compared to average edge strength, an image quality metric indicative of motion. This model is part of the ArtifactID tool, aimed at inline automatic detection of Gibbs ringing, wrap-around, and motion artifacts. This tool automates part of the time-consuming <b>QA</b> process and augments expertise on-site, particularly relevant in <b>low-resource</b> settings where local MR knowledge is scarce.

**ABSTRACT**  
Most text-to-3D generators build upon off-the-shelf <b>text-to-image</b> models trained on billions of images. They use variants of Score <b>Distillation</b> Sampling (SDS), which is slow, somewhat unstable, and prone to artifacts. A mitigation is to <b>fine-tune</b> the 2D generator to be multi-view aware, which can help <b>distillation</b> or can be combined with reconstruction networks to output 3D objects directly. In this paper, we further explore the design space of text-to-3D models. We significantly improve multi-view generation by considering video instead of image generators. Combined with a 3D reconstruction algorithm which, by using Gaussian splatting, can optimize a robust image-based loss, we directly produce high-quality 3D outputs from the generated views. Our new method, IM-3D, reduces the number of evaluations of the 2D generator network 10-100x, resulting in a much more efficient pipeline, better quality, fewer geometric inconsistencies, and higher yield of usable 3D assets.

**ABSTRACT**  
Current controls over diffusion models (e.g., through text or <b>ControlNet)</b> for image generation fall short in recognizing abstract, continuous attributes like illumination direction or non-rigid shape change. In this paper, we present an approach for allowing users of <b>text-to-image</b> models to have fine-grained control of several attributes in an image. We do this by engineering special sets of input tokens that can be transformed in a continuous manner -- we call them Continuous 3D Words. These attributes can, for example, be represented as sliders and applied jointly with text <b>prompts</b> for fine-grained control over image generation. Given only a single mesh and a rendering engine, we show that our approach can be adopted to provide continuous user control over several 3D-aware attributes, including time-of-day illumination, bird wing orientation, dollyzoom effect, and object poses. Our method is capable of conditioning image creation with multiple Continuous 3D Words and text descriptions simultaneously while adding no overhead to the generative process.

**ABSTRACT**  
In pediatric cardiology, the accurate and immediate assessment of cardiac function through echocardiography is important since it can determine whether urgent intervention is required in many emergencies. However, echocardiography is characterized by ambiguity and heavy background noise interference, bringing more difficulty to accurate segmentation. Present methods lack efficiency and are also prone to mistakenly segmenting some background noise areas as the left ventricular area due to noise disturbance. To relieve the two issues, we introduce P-Mamba for efficient pediatric echocardiographic left ventricular segmentation. Specifically, we turn to the recently proposed <b>vision</b> <b>mamba</b> layers in our <b>vision</b> <b>mamba</b> encoder branch to improve the computing and memory efficiency of our model while modeling global dependencies. In the other DWT-based PMD encoder branch, we devise DWT-based Perona-Malik Diffusion (PMD) Blocks that utilize PMD for noise suppression, while simultaneously preserving the local shape cues of the left ventricle. Leveraging the strengths of both the two encoder branches, P-Mamba achieves superior accuracy and efficiency to established models, such as <b>vision</b> <b>transformers</b> with quadratic and linear computational complexity. This innovative approach promises significant advancements in pediatric cardiac imaging and beyond.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Autoencoders</b> (AE) are simple yet powerful class of neural networks that compress data by projecting input into low-dimensional latent space (LS). Whereas LS is formed according to the loss function minimization during training, its properties and topology are not controlled directly. In this paper we focus on AE LS properties and propose two methods for obtaining LS with desired topology, called LS configuration. The proposed methods include loss configuration using a geometric loss term that acts directly in LS, and encoder configuration. We show that the former allows to reliably obtain LS with desired configuration by defining the positions and shapes of LS clusters for <b>supervised</b> AE (SAE). Knowing LS configuration allows to define similarity measure in LS to predict labels or estimate similarity for multiple inputs without using decoders or classifiers. We also show that this leads to more stable and interpretable training. We show that SAE trained for clothes texture classification using the proposed method generalizes well to unseen data from LIP, Market1501, and WildTrack datasets without <b>fine-tuning,</b> and even allows to evaluate similarity for unseen classes. We further illustrate the advantages of pre-configured LS similarity estimation with cross-dataset searches and text-based search using a text query without language models.

**ABSTRACT**  
Conditional computing processes an input using only part of the neural network's computational units. Learning to execute parts of a deep <b>convolutional</b> <b>network</b> <b>by</b> routing individual samples has several advantages: Reducing the computational burden is an obvious advantage. Furthermore, if similar classes are routed to the same path, that part of the network learns to discriminate between finer differences and better classification accuracies can be attained with fewer parameters. Recently, several papers have exploited this idea to take a particular child of a node in a tree-shaped network or to skip parts of a network. In this work, we follow a Trellis-based approach for generating specific execution paths in a deep <b>convolutional</b> <b>neural</b> <b>network.</b> We have designed routing mechanisms that use differentiable information gain-based cost functions to determine which subset of features in a <b>convolutional</b> <b>layer</b> <b>will</b> be executed. We call our method Conditional Information Gain Trellis (CIGT). We show that our conditional execution mechanism achieves comparable or better model performance compared to unconditional baselines, using only a fraction of the computational resources.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper proposes a dynamic interactive and weakly <b>supervised</b> segmentation method with minimal user interactions to address two major challenges in the segmentation of whole slide histopathology images. First, the lack of hand-annotated datasets to train algorithms. Second, the lack of interactive paradigms to enable a dialogue between the pathologist and the machine, which can be a major obstacle for use in clinical routine. We therefore propose a fast and user oriented method to bridge this gap by giving the pathologist control over the final result while limiting the number of interactions needed to achieve a good result (over 90\% on all our metrics with only 4 correction scribbles).

**ABSTRACT**  
Aligning <b>text-to-image</b> diffusion model (T2I) with preference has been gaining increasing research attention. While prior works exist on directly optimizing T2I by preference data, these methods are developed under the <b>bandit</b> assumption of a latent reward on the entire diffusion reverse chain, while ignoring the sequential nature of the generation process. From literature, this may harm the efficacy and efficiency of alignment. In this paper, we take on a finer dense reward perspective and derive a tractable alignment objective that emphasizes the initial steps of the T2I reverse chain. In particular, we introduce temporal discounting into the DPO-style explicit-reward-free loss, to break the temporal symmetry therein and suit the T2I generation hierarchy. In experiments on single and multiple <b>prompt</b> generation, our method is competitive with strong relevant baselines, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Further studies are conducted to illustrate the insight of our approach.

**ABSTRACT**  
We propose a method for generating spurious features by leveraging large-scale <b>text-to-image</b> diffusion models. Although the previous work detects spurious features in a large-scale dataset like ImageNet and introduces Spurious ImageNet, we found that not all spurious images are spurious across different classifiers. Although spurious images help measure the reliance of a classifier, filtering many images from the Internet to find more spurious features is time-consuming. To this end, we utilize an existing approach of personalizing large-scale <b>text-to-image</b> diffusion models with available discovered spurious images and propose a new spurious feature similarity loss based on neural features of an adversarially robust model. Precisely, we <b>fine-tune</b> Stable Diffusion with several reference images from Spurious ImageNet with a modified objective incorporating the proposed spurious-feature similarity loss. Experiment results show that our method can generate spurious images that are consistently spurious across different classifiers. Moreover, the generated spurious images are visually similar to reference images from Spurious ImageNet.

**ABSTRACT**  
The volume of image repositories continues to grow. Despite the availability of content-based addressing, we still lack a lightweight tool that allows us to discover images of distinct characteristics from a large collection. In this paper, we propose a fast and training-free algorithm for novel image discovery. The key of our algorithm is formulating a collection of images as a perceptual distance-weighted <b>graph,</b> within which our task is to locate the K-densest subgraph that corresponds to a subset of the most unique images. While solving this problem is not just NP-hard but also requires a full computation of the potentially huge distance matrix, we propose to relax it into a K-sparse eigenvector problem that we can efficiently solve using <b>stochastic</b> <b>gradient</b> <b>descent</b> <b>(SGD)</b> without explicitly computing the distance matrix. We compare our algorithm against state-of-the-arts on both synthetic and real datasets, showing that it is considerably faster to run with a smaller memory footprint while able to mine novel images more accurately.

**ABSTRACT**  
Gait, an unobtrusive biometric, is valued for its capability to identify individuals at a distance, across external outfits and environmental conditions. This study challenges the prevailing assumption that vision-based gait recognition, in particular skeleton-based gait recognition, relies primarily on motion patterns, revealing a significant role of the implicit anthropometric information encoded in the walking sequence. We show through a comparative analysis that removing height information leads to notable performance degradation across three models and two <b>benchmarks</b> (CASIA-B and GREW). Furthermore, we propose a spatial <b>transformer</b> model processing individual poses, disregarding any temporal information, which achieves unreasonably good accuracy, emphasizing the bias towards appearance information and indicating spurious correlations in existing <b>benchmarks.</b> These findings underscore the need for a nuanced understanding of the interplay between motion and appearance in vision-based gait recognition, <b>prompting</b> a reevaluation of the methodological assumptions in this field. Our experiments indicate that "in-the-wild" datasets are less prone to spurious correlations, <b>prompting</b> the need for more diverse and large scale datasets for advancing the field.

**ABSTRACT**  
Text-guided non-rigid editing involves complex edits for input images, such as changing motion or compositions within their surroundings. Since it requires manipulating the input structure, existing methods often struggle with preserving object identity and background, particularly when combined with Stable Diffusion. In this work, we propose a training-free approach for non-rigid editing with Stable Diffusion, aimed at improving the identity preservation quality without compromising editability. Our approach comprises three stages: text optimization, latent inversion, and timestep-aware text injection sampling. Inspired by the recent success of Imagic, we employ their text optimization for smooth editing. Then, we introduce latent inversion to preserve the input image's identity without additional model <b>fine-tuning.</b> To fully utilize the input reconstruction ability of latent inversion, we suggest timestep-aware text inject sampling. This effectively retains the structure of the input image by injecting the source text <b>prompt</b> in early sampling steps and then transitioning to the target <b>prompt</b> in subsequent sampling steps. This strategic approach seamlessly harmonizes with text optimization, facilitating complex non-rigid edits to the input without losing the original identity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in terms of identity preservation, editability, and aesthetic quality through extensive experiments.

**ABSTRACT**  
This work presents a neural network model capable of recognizing small and tiny <b>objects</b> <b>in</b> thermal images collected by unmanned aerial vehicles. Our model consists of three parts, the backbone, the neck, and the prediction head. The backbone is developed based on the structure of YOLOv5 combined with the use of a <b>transformer</b> encoder at the end. The neck includes a BI-FPN block combined with the use of a sliding window and a <b>transformer</b> to increase the information fed into the prediction head. The prediction head carries out the detection by evaluating feature maps with the Sigmoid function. The use of <b>transformers</b> with attention and sliding windows increases recognition accuracy while keeping the model at a reasonable number of parameters and computation requirements for embedded systems. Experiments conducted on public dataset VEDAI and our collected datasets show that our model has a higher accuracy than state-of-the-art methods such as ResNet, Faster RCNN, ComNet, ViT, YOLOv5, SMPNet, and DPNetV3. Experiments on the embedded computer Jetson AGX show that our model achieves a real-time computation speed with a stability rate of over 90%.

**ABSTRACT**  
Sign language discourse is an essential mode of daily communication for the deaf and hard-of-hearing people. However, research on Bangla Sign Language (BdSL) faces notable limitations, primarily due to the lack of datasets. Recognizing wordlevel signs in BdSL (WL-BdSL) presents a multitude of challenges, including the need for well-annotated datasets, capturing the dynamic nature of sign gestures from facial or hand landmarks, developing suitable machine learning or deep learning-based models with substantial video samples, and so on. In this paper, we address these challenges by creating a comprehensive BdSL word-level dataset named BdSLW60 in an unconstrained and natural setting, allowing positional and temporal variations and allowing sign users to change hand dominance freely. The dataset encompasses 60 Bangla sign words, with a significant scale of 9307 video trials provided by 18 signers under the supervision of a sign language professional. The dataset was rigorously annotated and cross-checked by 60 annotators. We also introduced a unique approach of a relative <b>quantization-based</b> key frame encoding technique for landmark based sign gesture recognition. We report the <b>benchmarking</b> of our BdSLW60 dataset using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) with testing accuracy up to 67.6% and an attention-based bi-LSTM with testing accuracy up to 75.1%. The dataset is available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hasaniut/bdslw60 and the code base is accessible from https://github.com/hasanssl/BdSLW60_Code.

**ABSTRACT**  
We propose RanDumb to examine the efficacy of <b>continual</b> <b>representation</b> learning. RanDumb embeds raw pixels using a fixed random transform which approximates an RBF-Kernel, initialized before seeing any data, and learns a simple linear classifier on top. We present a surprising and consistent finding: RanDumb significantly outperforms the continually learned representations using deep networks across numerous <b>continual</b> <b>learning</b> <b>benchmarks,</b> demonstrating the poor performance of representation learning in these scenarios. RanDumb stores no exemplars and performs a single pass over the data, processing one sample at a time. It complements GDumb, operating in a low-exemplar regime where GDumb has especially poor performance. We reach the same consistent conclusions when RanDumb is extended to scenarios with pretrained models replacing the random transform with pretrained feature extractor. Our investigation is both surprising and alarming as it questions our understanding of how to effectively design and train models that require efficient <b>continual</b> <b>representation</b> learning, and necessitates a principled reinvestigation of the widely explored problem formulation itself. Our code is available at https://github.com/drimpossible/RanDumb.

**ABSTRACT**  
The process of camera calibration involves estimating the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, which are essential for accurately performing tasks such as 3D reconstruction, object tracking and augmented reality. In this work, we propose a novel constraints-based loss for measuring the intrinsic (focal length: $(f_x, f_y)$ and principal point: $(p_x, p_y)$) and extrinsic (baseline: ($b$), disparity: ($d$), translation: $(t_x, t_y, t_z)$, and rotation specifically pitch: $(\theta_p)$) camera parameters. Our novel constraints are based on geometric properties inherent in the camera model, including the anatomy of the projection matrix (vanishing points, image of world origin, axis planes) and the orthonormality of the rotation matrix. Thus we proposed a novel <b>Unsupervised</b> Geometric Constraint Loss (UGCL) via a multitask learning framework. Our methodology is a hybrid approach that employs the learning power of a neural network to estimate the desired parameters along with the underlying mathematical properties inherent in the camera projection matrix. This distinctive approach not only enhances the interpretability of the model but also facilitates a more informed learning process. Additionally, we introduce a new CVGL Camera Calibration dataset, featuring over 900 configurations of camera parameters, incorporating 63,600 image pairs that closely mirror real-world conditions. By training and testing on both synthetic and real-world datasets, our proposed approach demonstrates improvements across all parameters when compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) <b>benchmarks.</b> The code and the updated dataset can be found here: https://github.com/CVLABLUMS/CVGL-Camera-Calibration

**ABSTRACT**  
Estimating the 3D shape of an object using a single image is a difficult problem. Modern approaches achieve good results for general objects, based on real photographs, but worse results on less expressive representations such as historic sketches. Our automated approach generates a variety of detailed 3D representation from a single sketch, depicting a medieval statue, and can be guided by <b>multi-modal</b> inputs, such as text <b>prompts.</b> It relies solely on synthetic data for training, making it adoptable even in cases of only small numbers of training examples. Our solution allows domain experts such as a curators to interactively reconstruct potential appearances of lost artifacts.

**ABSTRACT**  
We consider multi-source free <b>domain</b> <b>adaptation,</b> the problem of adapting multiple existing models to a new <b>domain</b> <b>without</b> accessing the source data. Among existing approaches, methods based on model ensemble are effective in both the source and target <b>domains,</b> <b>but</b> incur significantly increased computational costs. Towards this dilemma, in this work, we propose a novel framework called SepRep-Net, which tackles multi-source free <b>domain</b> <b>adaptation</b> via model Separation and Reparameterization.Concretely, SepRep-Net reassembled multiple existing models to a unified network, while maintaining separate pathways (Separation). During training, separate pathways are optimized in parallel with the information exchange regularly performed via an additional feature merging unit. With our specific design, these pathways can be further reparameterized into a single one to facilitate inference (Reparameterization). SepRep-Net is characterized by 1) effectiveness: competitive performance on the target <b>domain,</b> <b>2)</b> efficiency: low computational costs, and 3) generalizability: maintaining more source knowledge than existing solutions. As a general approach, SepRep-Net can be seamlessly plugged into various methods. Extensive experiments validate the performance of SepRep-Net on mainstream <b>benchmarks.</b>

**ABSTRACT**  
One-stream <b>Transformer</b> trackers have shown outstanding performance in challenging <b>benchmark</b> datasets over the last three years, as they enable interaction between the target template and search region tokens to extract target-oriented features with mutual guidance. Previous approaches allow free bidirectional information flow between template and search tokens without investigating their influence on the tracker's discriminative capability. In this study, we conducted a detailed study on the information flow of the tokens and based on the findings, we propose a novel Optimized Information Flow Tracking (OIFTrack) framework to enhance the discriminative capability of the tracker. The proposed OIFTrack blocks the interaction from all search tokens to target template tokens in early encoder layers, as the large number of non-target tokens in the search region diminishes the importance of target-specific features. In the deeper encoder layers of the proposed tracker, search tokens are partitioned into target search tokens and non-target search tokens, allowing bidirectional flow from target search tokens to template tokens to capture the appearance changes of the target. In addition, since the proposed tracker incorporates dynamic background cues, distractor objects are successfully avoided by capturing the surrounding information of the target. The OIFTrack demonstrated outstanding performance in challenging <b>benchmarks,</b> particularly excelling in the one-shot tracking <b>benchmark</b> GOT-10k, achieving an average overlap of 74.6\%.

**ABSTRACT**  
Medical image segmentation is a critical process in the field of medical imaging, playing a pivotal role in diagnosis, treatment, and research. It involves partitioning of an image into multiple regions, representing distinct anatomical or pathological structures. Conventional methods often grapple with the challenge of balancing spatial precision and comprehensive feature representation due to their reliance on traditional loss functions. To overcome this, we propose Feature-Enhanced Spatial Segmentation Loss (FESS Loss), that integrates the benefits of <b>contrastive</b> <b>learning</b> (which extracts intricate features, particularly in the nuanced domain of medical imaging) with the spatial accuracy inherent in the Dice loss. The objective is to augment both spatial precision and feature-based representation in the segmentation of medical images. FESS Loss signifies a notable advancement, offering a more accurate and refined segmentation process, ultimately contributing to heightened precision in the analysis of medical images. Further, FESS loss demonstrates superior performance in limited annotated data availability scenarios often present in the medical domain.

**ABSTRACT**  
Computational aesthetic evaluation has made remarkable contribution to visual art works, but its application to music is still rare. Currently, subjective evaluation is still the most effective form of evaluating artistic works. However, subjective evaluation of artistic works will consume a lot of human and material resources. The popular AI generated content (AIGC) tasks nowadays have flooded all industries, and music is no exception. While compared to music produced by humans, AI generated music still sounds mechanical, monotonous, and lacks aesthetic appeal. Due to the lack of music datasets with rating annotations, we have to choose traditional aesthetic equations to objectively measure the beauty of music. In order to improve the quality of AI music generation and further guide computer music production, synthesis, <b>recommendation</b> and other tasks, we use Birkhoff's aesthetic measure to design a aesthetic model, objectively measuring the aesthetic beauty of music, and form a <b>recommendation</b> list according to the aesthetic feeling of music. Experiments show that our objective aesthetic model and <b>recommendation</b> method are effective.

**ABSTRACT**  
Image coding for machines (ICM) aims to compress images for machine analysis using recognition models rather than human vision. Hence, in ICM, it is important for the encoder to recognize and compress the information necessary for the machine recognition task. There are two main approaches in learned ICM; optimization of the compression model based on task loss, and Region of Interest (ROI) based bit allocation. These approaches provide the encoder with the recognition capability. However, optimization with task loss becomes difficult when the recognition model is deep, and ROI-based methods often involve extra overhead during evaluation. In this study, we propose a novel training method for learned ICM models that applies auxiliary loss to the encoder to improve its recognition capability and rate-distortion performance. Our method achieves Bjontegaard Delta rate improvements of 27.7% and 20.3% in <b>object</b> <b>detection</b> and semantic segmentation tasks, compared to the conventional training method.

**ABSTRACT**  
The extraction of road network is essential for the generation of high-definition maps since it enables the precise localization of road landmarks and their interconnections. However, generating road network poses a significant challenge due to the conflicting underlying combination of Euclidean (e.g., road landmarks location) and non-Euclidean (e.g., road topological connectivity) structures. Existing methods struggle to merge the two types of data domains effectively, but few of them address it properly. Instead, our work establishes a unified representation of both types of data domain by projecting both Euclidean and non-Euclidean data into an integer series called RoadNet Sequence. Further than modeling an auto-regressive sequence-to-sequence <b>Transformer</b> model to understand RoadNet Sequence, we decouple the dependency of RoadNet Sequence into a mixture of auto-regressive and non-autoregressive dependency. Building on this, our proposed non-autoregressive sequence-to-sequence approach leverages non-autoregressive dependencies while fixing the gap towards auto-regressive dependencies, resulting in success on both efficiency and accuracy. Extensive experiments on nuScenes dataset demonstrate the superiority of RoadNet Sequence representation and the non-autoregressive approach compared to existing state-of-the-art alternatives. The code is open-source on https://github.com/fudan-zvg/RoadNetworkTRansformer.

**ABSTRACT**  
Accurate prediction of pedestrians' future motions is critical for intelligent driving systems. Developing models for this task requires rich datasets containing diverse sets of samples. However, the existing naturalistic trajectory prediction datasets are generally imbalanced in favor of simpler samples and lack challenging scenarios. Such a long-tail effect causes prediction models to underperform on the tail portion of the data distribution containing safety-critical scenarios. Previous methods tackle the long-tail problem using methods such as <b>contrastive</b> <b>learning</b> and class-conditioned hypernetworks. These approaches, however, are not modular and cannot be applied to many machine learning architectures. In this work, we propose a modular model-agnostic framework for trajectory prediction that leverages a specialized mixture of experts. In our approach, each expert is trained with a specialized skill with respect to a particular part of the data. To produce predictions, we utilise a router network that selects the best expert by generating relative confidence scores. We conduct experimentation on common pedestrian trajectory prediction datasets and show that besides achieving state-of-the-art performance, our method significantly performs better on long-tail scenarios. We further conduct ablation studies to highlight the contribution of different proposed components.

**ABSTRACT**  
This study addresses the challenge of performing visual localization in demanding conditions such as night-time scenarios, adverse weather, and seasonal changes. While many prior studies have focused on improving image-matching performance to facilitate reliable dense keypoint matching between images, existing methods often heavily rely on predefined feature points on a reconstructed 3D model. Consequently, they tend to overlook unobserved keypoints during the matching process. Therefore, dense keypoint matches are not fully exploited, leading to a notable reduction in accuracy, particularly in noisy scenes. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel localization method that extracts reliable semi-dense 2D-3D matching points based on dense keypoint matches. This approach involves regressing semi-dense 2D keypoints into 3D scene coordinates using a point inference network. The network utilizes both geometric and visual cues to effectively infer 3D coordinates for unobserved keypoints from the observed ones. The abundance of matching information significantly enhances the accuracy of camera pose estimation, even in scenarios involving noisy or sparse 3D models. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other methods in challenging scenes and achieves competitive results in large-scale visual localization <b>benchmarks.</b> The code will be available.

**ABSTRACT**  
Gaze estimation, the task of predicting where an individual is looking, is a critical task with direct applications in areas such as human-computer interaction and virtual reality. Estimating the direction of looking in unconstrained environments is difficult, due to the many factors that can obscure the face and eye regions. In this work we propose CrossGaze, a strong baseline for gaze estimation, that leverages recent developments in computer vision architectures and attention-based modules. Unlike previous approaches, our method does not require a specialised architecture, utilizing already established models that we integrate in our architecture and adapt for the task of 3D gaze estimation. This approach allows for seamless updates to the architecture as any module can be replaced with more powerful feature extractors. On the Gaze360 <b>benchmark,</b> our model surpasses several state-of-the-art methods, achieving a mean angular error of 9.94 degrees. Our proposed model serves as a strong foundation for future research and development in gaze estimation, paving the way for practical and accurate gaze prediction in real-world scenarios.

**ABSTRACT**  
Background: <b>Large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> <b>(LLMs)</b> such as OpenAI's <b>GPT-4</b> or Google's <b>PaLM</b> 2 are proposed as viable diagnostic support tools or even spoken of as replacements for "curbside consults". However, even <b>LLMs</b> specifically trained on medical topics may lack sufficient diagnostic accuracy for real-life applications. Methods: Using collective intelligence methods and a dataset of 200 clinical vignettes of real-life cases, we assessed and compared the accuracy of differential diagnoses obtained by asking individual commercial <b>LLMs</b> (OpenAI <b>GPT-4,</b> Google <b>PaLM</b> 2, <b>Cohere</b> Command, Meta <b>Llama</b> 2) against the accuracy of differential diagnoses synthesized by aggregating responses from combinations of the same <b>LLMs.</b> Results: We find that aggregating responses from multiple, various <b>LLMs</b> leads to more accurate differential diagnoses (average accuracy for 3 <b>LLMs:</b> $75.3\%\pm 1.6pp$) compared to the differential diagnoses produced by single <b>LLMs</b> (average accuracy for single <b>LLMs:</b> $59.0\%\pm 6.1pp$). Discussion: The use of collective intelligence methods to synthesize differential diagnoses combining the responses of different <b>LLMs</b> achieves two of the necessary steps towards advancing acceptance of <b>LLMs</b> as a diagnostic support tool: (1) demonstrate high diagnostic accuracy and (2) eliminate dependence on a single commercial vendor.

**ABSTRACT**  
The development of large <b>vision-language</b> models (LVLMs) offers the potential to address challenges faced by traditional <b>multimodal</b> <b>recommendations</b> thanks to their proficient understanding of static images and textual dynamics. However, the application of LVLMs in this field is still limited due to the following complexities: First, LVLMs lack user preference knowledge as they are trained from vast general datasets. Second, LVLMs suffer setbacks in addressing multiple image dynamics in scenarios involving discrete, noisy, and redundant image sequences. To overcome these issues, we propose the novel <b>reasoning</b> scheme named Rec-GPT4V: Visual-Summary Thought (VST) of leveraging large <b>vision-language</b> models for <b>multimodal</b> <b>recommendation.</b> We utilize user history as <b>in-context</b> user preferences to address the first challenge. Next, we <b>prompt</b> LVLMs to generate item image summaries and utilize image comprehension in natural language space combined with item titles to query the user preferences over candidate items. We conduct comprehensive experiments across four datasets with three LVLMs: <b>GPT4-V,</b> LLaVa-7b, and LLaVa-13b. The numerical results indicate the efficacy of VST.

**ABSTRACT**  
Modeling subrational agents, such as humans or economic households, is inherently challenging due to the difficulty in calibrating <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning</b> models or collecting data that involves human subjects. Existing work highlights the ability of <b>Large</b> <b>Language</b> <b>Models</b> <b>(LLMs)</b> to address complex <b>reasoning</b> tasks and mimic human communication, while <b>simulation</b> using <b>LLMs</b> as agents shows emergent social behaviors, potentially improving our comprehension of human conduct. In this paper, we propose to investigate the use of <b>LLMs</b> to generate synthetic human demonstrations, which are then used to learn subrational agent policies though Imitation Learning. We make an assumption that <b>LLMs</b> can be used as implicit computational models of humans, and propose a framework to use synthetic demonstrations derived from <b>LLMs</b> to model subrational behaviors that are characteristic of humans (e.g., myopic behavior or preference for risk aversion). We experimentally evaluate the ability of our framework to model sub-rationality through four simple scenarios, including the well-researched ultimatum game and marshmallow experiment. To gain confidence in our framework, we are able to replicate well-established findings from prior human studies associated with the above scenarios. We conclude by discussing the potential benefits, challenges and limitations of our framework.

**ABSTRACT**  
The ability of <b>Large</b> <b>Language</b> <b>Models</b> <b>(LLMs)</b> to generate high-quality text and code has fuelled their rise in popularity. In this paper, we aim to demonstrate the potential of <b>LLMs</b> within the realm of optimization algorithms by integrating them into STNWeb. This is a web-based tool for the generation of Search Trajectory Networks (STNs), which are visualizations of optimization algorithm behavior. Although visualizations produced by STNWeb can be very informative for algorithm designers, they often require a certain level of prior knowledge to be interpreted. In an attempt to bridge this knowledge gap, we have incorporated <b>LLMs,</b> specifically <b>GPT-4,</b> into STNWeb to produce extensive written reports, complemented by automatically generated plots, thereby enhancing the user experience and reducing the barriers to the adoption of this tool by the research community. Moreover, our approach can be expanded to other tools from the optimization community, showcasing the versatility and potential of <b>LLMs</b> in this field.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> <b>(LLMs)</b> have recently received considerable attention as alternative solutions for task planning. However, comparing the performance of language-oriented task planners becomes difficult, and there exists a dearth of detailed exploration regarding the effects of various factors such as pre-trained model selection and <b>prompt</b> construction. To address this, we propose a <b>benchmark</b> system for automatically quantifying performance of task planning for home-service embodied agents. Task planners are tested on two pairs of datasets and simulators: 1) ALFRED and AI2-THOR, 2) an extension of Watch-And-Help and VirtualHome. Using the proposed <b>benchmark</b> system, we perform extensive experiments with <b>LLMs</b> and <b>prompts,</b> and explore several enhancements of the baseline planner. We expect that the proposed <b>benchmark</b> tool would accelerate the development of language-oriented task planners.

**ABSTRACT**  
One-shot imitation is to learn a new task from a single demonstration, yet it is a challenging problem to adopt it for complex tasks with the high domain diversity inherent in a non-stationary environment. To tackle the problem, we explore the compositionality of complex tasks, and present a novel skill-based imitation learning framework enabling one-shot imitation and <b>zero-shot</b> adaptation; from a single demonstration for a complex unseen task, a semantic skill sequence is inferred and then each skill in the sequence is converted into an action sequence optimized for environmental hidden dynamics that can vary over time. Specifically, we leverage a <b>vision-language</b> model to learn a semantic skill set from offline video datasets, where each skill is represented on the <b>vision-language</b> embedding space, and adapt <b>meta-learning</b> <b>with</b> dynamics inference to enable <b>zero-shot</b> skill adaptation. We evaluate our framework with various one-shot imitation scenarios for extended multi-stage <b>Meta-world</b> <b>tasks,</b> showing its superiority in learning complex tasks, generalizing to dynamics changes, and extending to different demonstration conditions and modalities, compared to other baselines.

**ABSTRACT**  
The autoregressive nature of conventional <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> <b>(LLMs)</b> inherently limits inference speed, as tokens are generated sequentially. While speculative and parallel decoding techniques attempt to mitigate this, they face limitations: either relying on less accurate smaller models for generation or failing to fully leverage the base <b>LLM's</b> representations. We introduce a novel architecture, Tandem <b>transformers,</b> to address these issues. This architecture uniquely combines (1) a small autoregressive model and (2) a <b>large</b> <b>model</b> <b>operating</b> in block mode (processing multiple tokens simultaneously). The small model's predictive accuracy is substantially enhanced by granting it attention to the <b>large</b> <b>model's</b> <b>richer</b> representations. On the PaLM2 pretraining dataset, a tandem of PaLM2-Bison and PaLM2-Gecko demonstrates a 3.3% improvement in next-token prediction accuracy over a standalone PaLM2-Gecko, offering a 1.16x speedup compared to a PaLM2-Otter model with comparable downstream performance. We further incorporate the tandem model within the speculative decoding (SPEED) framework where the <b>large</b> <b>model</b> <b>validates</b> tokens from the small model. This ensures that the Tandem of PaLM2-Bison and PaLM2-Gecko achieves substantial speedup (around 1.14x faster than using vanilla PaLM2-Gecko in SPEED) while maintaining identical downstream task accuracy.

**ABSTRACT**  
Background: Colonoscopy, a crucial diagnostic tool in gastroenterology, depends heavily on superior bowel preparation. <b>ChatGPT,</b> a <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>model</b> with emergent intelligence which also exhibits potential in medical applications. This study aims to assess the accuracy and consistency of <b>ChatGPT</b> in using the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS) for colonoscopy assessment. Methods: We retrospectively collected 233 colonoscopy images from 2020 to 2023. These images were evaluated using the BBPS by 3 senior endoscopists and 3 novice endoscopists. Additionally, <b>ChatGPT</b> also assessed these images, having been divided into three groups and undergone specific <b>Fine-tuning.</b> Consistency was evaluated through two rounds of testing. Results: In the initial round, <b>ChatGPT's</b> accuracy varied between 48.93% and 62.66%, trailing the endoscopists' accuracy of 76.68% to 77.83%. Kappa values for <b>ChatGPT</b> was between 0.52 and 0.53, compared to 0.75 to 0.87 for the endoscopists. Conclusion: While <b>ChatGPT</b> shows promise in bowel preparation scoring, it currently does not match the accuracy and consistency of experienced endoscopists. Future research should focus on in-depth <b>Fine-tuning.</b>

**ABSTRACT**  
Models based on the <b>Transformer</b> neural network architecture have seen success on a wide variety of tasks that appear to require complex "cognitive branching" -- or the ability to maintain pursuit of one goal while accomplishing others. In cognitive neuroscience, success on such tasks is thought to rely on sophisticated frontostriatal mechanisms for selective \textit{gating}, which enable role-addressable updating -- and later readout -- of information to and from distinct "addresses" of memory, in the form of clusters of neurons. However, <b>Transformer</b> models have no such mechanisms intentionally built-in. It is thus an open question how <b>Transformers</b> solve such tasks, and whether the mechanisms that emerge to help them to do so bear any resemblance to the <b>gating</b> mechanisms in the human brain. In this work, we analyze the mechanisms that emerge within a vanilla attention-only <b>Transformer</b> trained on a simple sequence modeling task inspired by a task explicitly designed to study working memory <b>gating</b> in computational cognitive neuroscience. We find that, as a result of training, the <b>self-attention</b> mechanism within the <b>Transformer</b> specializes in a way that mirrors the input and output <b>gating</b> mechanisms which were explicitly incorporated into earlier, more biologically-inspired architectures. These results suggest opportunities for future research on computational similarities between modern AI architectures and models of the human brain.

**ABSTRACT**  
Multi-Agent <b>Reinforcement</b> <b>Learning</b> (MARL) algorithms are widely adopted in tackling complex tasks that require collaboration and competition among agents in dynamic Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). However, learning such tasks from scratch is arduous and may not always be feasible, particularly for MASs with a large number of interactive agents due to the extensive sample complexity. Therefore, reusing <b>knowledge</b> <b>gained</b> from past experiences or other agents could efficiently accelerate the learning process and upscale MARL algorithms. In this study, we introduce a novel framework that enables <b>transfer</b> <b>learning</b> for MARL through unifying various state spaces into fixed-size inputs that allow one unified deep-learning policy viable in different scenarios within a MAS. We evaluated our approach in a range of scenarios within the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC) environment, and the findings show significant enhancements in multi-agent learning performance using maneuvering skills learned from other scenarios compared to agents learning from scratch. Furthermore, we adopted Curriculum <b>Transfer</b> <b>Learning</b> (CTL), enabling our deep learning policy to progressively acquire <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> skills across pre-designed homogeneous learning scenarios organized by difficulty levels. This process promotes inter- and intra-agent <b>knowledge</b> <b>transfer,</b> <b>leading</b> to high multi-agent learning performance in more complicated heterogeneous scenarios.

**ABSTRACT**  
Our work addresses a fundamental problem in the context of <b>counterfactual</b> inference for Markov Decision Processes <b>(MDPs).</b> Given an MDP path $\tau$, this kind of inference allows us to derive <b>counterfactual</b> paths $\tau'$ describing what-if versions of $\tau$ obtained under different action sequences than those observed in $\tau$. However, as the <b>counterfactual</b> states and actions deviate from the observed ones over time, the observation $\tau$ may no longer influence the <b>counterfactual</b> world, meaning that the analysis is no longer tailored to the individual observation, resulting in interventional outcomes rather than <b>counterfactual</b> ones. Even though this issue specifically affects the popular Gumbel-max structural causal model used for MDP <b>counterfactuals,</b> it has remained overlooked until now. In this work, we introduce a formal characterisation of influence based on comparing <b>counterfactual</b> and interventional distributions. We devise an algorithm to construct <b>counterfactual</b> models that automatically satisfy influence constraints. Leveraging such models, we derive <b>counterfactual</b> policies that are not just optimal for a given reward structure but also remain tailored to the observed path. Even though there is an unavoidable trade-off between policy optimality and strength of influence constraints, our experiments demonstrate that it is possible to derive (near-)optimal policies while remaining under the influence of the observation.

**ABSTRACT**  
The challenge in learning abstract concepts from images in an <b>unsupervised</b> fashion lies in the required integration of visual perception and generalizable relational <b>reasoning.</b> Moreover, the <b>unsupervised</b> nature of this task makes it necessary for human users to be able to understand a model's learnt concepts and potentially revise false behaviours. To tackle both the generalizability and interpretability constraints of visual concept learning, we propose Pix2Code, a framework that extends program synthesis to visual relational <b>reasoning</b> by utilizing the abilities of both explicit, compositional symbolic and implicit neural representations. This is achieved by retrieving object representations from images and synthesizing relational concepts as lambda-calculus programs. We evaluate the diverse properties of Pix2Code on the challenging <b>reasoning</b> domains, Kandinsky Patterns and CURI, thereby testing its ability to identify compositional visual concepts that generalize to novel data and concept configurations. Particularly, in stark contrast to neural approaches, we show that Pix2Code's representations remain human interpretable and can be easily revised for improved performance.

**ABSTRACT**  
We propose BERT4FCA, a novel method for link prediction in bipartite networks, using formal concept analysis (FCA) and <b>BERT.</b> Link prediction in bipartite networks is an important task that can solve various practical problems like friend <b>recommendation</b> in social networks and co-authorship prediction in author-paper networks. Recent research has found that in bipartite networks, maximal bi-cliques provide important information for link prediction, and they can be extracted by FCA. Some FCA-based bipartite link prediction methods have achieved good performance. However, we figured out that their performance could be further improved because these methods did not fully capture the rich information of the extracted maximal bi-cliques. To address this limitation, we propose an approach using <b>BERT,</b> which can learn more information from the maximal bi-cliques extracted by FCA and use them to make link prediction. We conduct experiments on three real-world bipartite networks and demonstrate that our method outperforms previous FCA-based methods, and some classic methods such as matrix-factorization and node2vec.

**ABSTRACT**  
XAI (eXplanable AI) techniques that have the property of explaining the reasons for their conclusions, i.e. explainability or interpretability, are attracting attention. XAI is expected to be used in the development of forensic science and the justice system. In today's forensic and criminal investigation environment, experts face many challenges due to large amounts of data, small pieces of evidence in a chaotic and complex environment, traditional laboratory structures and sometimes inadequate <b>knowledge.</b> <b>All</b> these can lead to failed investigations and miscarriages of justice. In this paper, we describe the application of one logical approach to crime scene investigation. The subject of the application is ``The Adventure of the Speckled Band'' from the Sherlock Holmes short stories. The applied data is the <b>knowledge</b> <b>graph</b> created for the <b>Knowledge</b> <b>Graph</b> <b>Reasoning</b> Challenge. We tried to find the murderer by inferring each person with the motive, opportunity, and method. We created an ontology of motives and methods of murder from dictionaries and dictionaries, added it to the <b>knowledge</b> <b>graph</b> of ``The Adventure of the Speckled Band'', and applied scripts to determine motives, opportunities, and methods.

**ABSTRACT**  
In autonomous driving, predicting the behavior (turning left, stopping, etc.) of target vehicles is crucial for the self-driving vehicle to make safe decisions and avoid accidents. Existing deep learning-based methods have shown excellent and accurate performance, but the black-box nature makes it untrustworthy to apply them in practical use. In this work, we explore the interpretability of behavior prediction of target vehicles by an Episodic Memory implanted Neural Decision Tree (abbrev. eMem-NDT). The structure of eMem-NDT is constructed by hierarchically <b>clustering</b> the <b>text</b> <b>embedding</b> of vehicle behavior descriptions. eMem-NDT is a neural-backed part of a pre-trained deep learning model by changing the soft-max layer of the deep model to eMem-NDT, for grouping and aligning the memory prototypes of the historical vehicle behavior features in training data on a neural decision tree. Each leaf node of eMem-NDT is modeled by a neural network for aligning the behavior memory prototypes. By eMem-NDT, we infer each instance in behavior prediction of vehicles by bottom-up Memory Prototype Matching (MPM) (searching the appropriate leaf node and the links to the root node) and top-down Leaf Link Aggregation (LLA) (obtaining the probability of future behaviors of vehicles for certain instances). We validate eMem-NDT on BLVD and LOKI datasets, and the results show that our model can obtain a superior performance to other methods with clear explainability. The code is available at https://github.com/JWFangit/eMem-NDT.

**ABSTRACT**  
Modern deep learning techniques, which mimic traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) models and are derived from global atmospheric reanalysis <b>data,</b> <b>have</b> caused a significant revolution within a few years. In this new paradigm, our research introduces a novel strategy that deviates from the common dependence on high-resolution <b>data,</b> <b>which</b> is often constrained by computational resources, and instead utilizes low-resolution <b>data</b> <b>(2.5</b> degrees) for global weather prediction and climate <b>data</b> <b>analysis.</b> Our main focus is evaluating <b>data-driven</b> <b>weather</b> prediction (DDWP) frameworks, specifically addressing <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> adequacy, structural improvements to the model, and the ability of climate <b>data</b> <b>to</b> represent current climatic trends. By using the Adaptive Fourier Neural Operator (AFNO) model via FourCastNet and a proposed time-sliding method to inflate the dataset of the ECMWF Reanalysis v5 (ERA5), this paper improves on conventional approaches by adding more variables and a novel approach to <b>data</b> <b>augmentation</b> and processing. Our findings reveal that despite the lower resolution, the proposed approach demonstrates considerable accuracy in predicting atmospheric conditions, effectively rivaling higher-resolution models. Furthermore, the study confirms the model's proficiency in reflecting current climate trends and its potential in predicting future climatic events, underscoring its utility in climate change strategies. This research marks a pivotal step in the realm of meteorological forecasting, showcasing the feasibility of lower-resolution <b>data</b> <b>in</b> producing reliable predictions and opening avenues for more accessible and inclusive climate modeling. The insights gleaned from this study not only contribute to the advancement of climate science but also lay the groundwork for future innovations in the field.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper introduces a new approach for continual planning and model learning in non-stationary stochastic environments expressed using relational representations. Such capabilities are essential for the deployment of sequential decision-making systems in the uncertain, constantly evolving real world. Working in such practical settings with unknown (and non-stationary) transition systems and changing tasks, the proposed framework models gaps in the agent's current state of knowledge and uses them to conduct focused, investigative explorations. Data collected using these explorations is used for learning generalizable <b>probabilistic</b> <b>models</b> for solving the current task despite continual changes in the environment dynamics. Empirical evaluations on several <b>benchmark</b> domains show that this approach significantly outperforms planning and RL baselines in terms of sample complexity in non-stationary settings. Theoretical results show that the system reverts to exhibit desirable convergence properties when stationarity holds.

**ABSTRACT**  
The Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) problem entails finding collision-free paths for a set of agents, guiding them from their start to goal locations. However, MAPF does not account for several practical task-related constraints. For example, agents may need to perform actions at goal locations with specific execution times, adhering to predetermined orders and timeframes. Moreover, goal assignments may not be predefined for agents, and the optimization objective may lack an explicit definition. To incorporate task assignment, path planning, and a user-defined objective into a coherent framework, this paper examines the Task Assignment and Path Finding with Precedence and Temporal Constraints (TAPF-PTC) problem. We augment Conflict-Based Search (CBS) to simultaneously generate task assignments and collision-free paths that adhere to precedence and temporal constraints, maximizing an objective quantified by the return from a user-defined reward function in <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning</b> (RL). Experimentally, we demonstrate that our algorithm, CBS-TA-PTC, can solve highly challenging bomb-defusing tasks with precedence and temporal constraints efficiently relative to MARL and adapted Target Assignment and Path Finding (TAPF) methods.

**ABSTRACT**  
Inspired by empirical work in neuroscience for Bayesian approaches to brain function, we give a unified probabilistic account of various types of symbolic <b>reasoning</b> from data. We characterise them in terms of formal logic using the classical consequence relation, an empirical consequence relation, maximal consistent sets, maximal possible sets and maximum likelihood estimation. The theory gives new insights into <b>reasoning</b> towards human-like machine intelligence.

**ABSTRACT**  
This manuscript presents a comprehensive review of the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Systematic Literature Reviews (SLRs). A SLR is a rigorous and organised methodology that assesses and integrates previous research on a given topic. Numerous tools have been developed to assist and partially automate the SLR process. The increasing role of AI in this field shows great potential in providing more effective support for researchers, moving towards the semi-automatic creation of literature reviews. Our study focuses on how AI techniques are applied in the semi-automation of SLRs, specifically in the screening and extraction phases. We examine 21 leading SLR tools using a framework that combines 23 traditional features with 11 AI features. We also analyse 11 recent tools that leverage <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> for searching the literature and assisting academic writing. Finally, the paper discusses current trends in the field, outlines key research challenges, and suggests directions for future research.

**ABSTRACT**  
Fervent calls for more robust governance of the harms associated with artificial intelligence (AI) are leading to the adoption around the world of what regulatory scholars have called a management-based approach to regulation. Recent initiatives in the United States and Europe, as well as the adoption of major self-regulatory standards by the International Organization for Standardization, share in common a core management-based paradigm. These management-based initiatives seek to motivate an increase in human oversight of how AI tools are trained and developed. Refinements and systematization of human-guided training techniques will thus be needed to fit within this emerging era of management-based regulatory paradigm. If taken seriously, human-guided training can alleviate some of the technical and ethical pressures on AI, boosting AI performance with human intuition as well as better addressing the needs for <b>fairness</b> and effective explainability. In this paper, we discuss the connection between the emerging management-based regulatory frameworks governing AI and the need for human oversight during training. We broadly cover some of the technical components involved in human-guided training and then argue that the kinds of high-stakes use cases for AI that appear of most concern to regulators should lean more on human-guided training than on data-only training. We hope to foster a discussion between legal scholars and computer scientists involving how to govern a domain of technology that is vast, heterogenous, and dynamic in its applications and risks.

**ABSTRACT**  
Artificial intelligence (AI) systems have the potential to revolutionize clinical practices, including improving diagnostic accuracy and surgical decision-making, while also reducing costs and manpower. However, it is important to recognize that these systems may perpetuate social inequities or demonstrate biases, such as those based on race or gender. Such biases can occur before, during, or after the development of AI models, making it critical to understand and address potential biases to enable the accurate and reliable application of AI models in clinical settings. To mitigate bias concerns during model development, we surveyed recent publications on different debiasing methods in the fields of biomedical natural language processing (NLP) or computer vision (CV). Then we discussed the methods that have been applied in the biomedical domain to address bias. We performed our literature search on PubMed, ACM digital library, and IEEE Xplore of relevant articles published between January 2018 and December 2023 using multiple combinations of keywords. We then filtered the result of 10,041 articles automatically with loose constraints, and manually inspected the abstracts of the remaining 890 articles to identify the 55 articles included in this review. Additional articles in the references are also included in this review. We discuss each method and compare its strengths and weaknesses. Finally, we review other potential methods from the general domain that could be applied to biomedicine to address bias and improve <b>fairness.The</b> bias of AIs in biomedicine can originate from multiple sources. Existing debiasing methods that focus on algorithms can be categorized into distributional or algorithmic.

**ABSTRACT**  
Machine Learning (ML) and 'Artificial Intelligence' ('AI') methods tend to replicate and amplify existing biases and prejudices, as do Robots with AI. For example, robots with facial recognition have failed to identify Black Women as human, while others have categorized people, such as Black Men, as criminals based on appearance alone. A 'culture of modularity' means harms are perceived as 'out of scope', or someone else's responsibility, throughout employment positions in the 'AI supply chain'. Incidents are routine enough (incidentdatabase.ai lists over 2000 examples) to indicate that few organizations are capable of completely respecting peoples' rights; meeting claimed equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI or DEI) goals; or recognizing and then addressing such failures in their organizations and artifacts. We propose a framework for adapting widely practiced Research and Development (R&D) project management methodologies to build organizational equity capabilities and better integrate known evidence-based best practices. We describe how project teams can organize and operationalize the most promising practices, skill sets, organizational cultures, and methods to detect and address rights-based <b>fairness,</b> equity, accountability, and ethical problems as early as possible when they are often less harmful and easier to mitigate; then monitor for unforeseen incidents to adaptively and constructively address them. Our primary example adapts an Agile development process based on Scrum, one of the most widely adopted approaches to organizing R&D teams. We also discuss limitations of our proposed framework and future research directions.

**ABSTRACT**  
Learning positional information of nodes in a <b>graph</b> is important for link prediction tasks. We propose a representation of positional information using representative nodes called landmarks. A small number of nodes with high degree centrality are selected as landmarks, which serve as reference points for the nodes' positions. We justify this selection strategy for well-known random <b>graph</b> models and derive closed-form bounds on the average path lengths involving landmarks. In a model for power-law <b>graphs,</b> we prove that landmarks provide asymptotically exact information on inter-node distances. We apply theoretical insights to practical networks and propose Hierarchical Position embedding with Landmarks and <b>Clustering</b> (HPLC). HPLC combines landmark selection and <b>graph</b> <b>clustering,</b> where the <b>graph</b> is partitioned into densely connected clusters in which nodes with the highest degree are selected as landmarks. HPLC leverages the positional information of nodes based on landmarks at various levels of hierarchy such as nodes' distances to landmarks, inter-landmark distances and hierarchical grouping of clusters. Experiments show that HPLC achieves state-of-the-art performances of link prediction on various datasets in terms of HIT@K, MRR, and AUC. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/kmswin1/HPLC}.

**ABSTRACT**  
Experimentation is an intrinsic part of research in artificial intelligence since it allows for collecting quantitative observations, validating hypotheses, and providing evidence for their reformulation. For that reason, experimentation must be coherent with the purposes of the research, properly addressing the relevant questions in each case. Unfortunately, the literature is full of works whose experimentation is neither rigorous nor convincing, oftentimes designed to support prior beliefs rather than answering the relevant research questions. In this paper, we focus on the field of metaheuristic optimization, since it is our main field of work, and it is where we have observed the misconduct that has motivated this letter. Even if we limit the focus of this manuscript to the experimental part of the research, our main goal is to sew the seed of sincere critical assessment of our work, sparking a reflection process both at the individual and the community level. Such a reflection process is too complex and extensive to be tackled as a whole. Therefore, to bring our feet to the ground, we will include in this document our reflections about the role of experimentation in our work, discussing topics such as the use of <b>benchmark</b> instances vs instance generators, or the statistical assessment of empirical results. That is, all the statements included in this document are personal views and opinions, which can be shared by others or not. Certainly, having different points of view is the basis to establish a good discussion process.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper explores the role and challenges of Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms, specifically AI-based software elements, in autonomous driving systems. These AI systems are fundamental in executing real-time critical functions in complex and high-dimensional environments. They handle vital tasks like <b>multi-modal</b> perception, cognition, and decision-making tasks such as motion planning, lane keeping, and emergency braking. A primary concern relates to the ability (and necessity) of AI models to generalize beyond their initial training data. This generalization issue becomes evident in real-time scenarios, where models frequently encounter inputs not represented in their training or validation data. In such cases, AI systems must still function effectively despite facing distributional or domain shifts. This paper investigates the risk associated with overconfident AI models in safety-critical applications like autonomous driving. To mitigate these risks, methods for training AI models that help maintain performance without overconfidence are proposed. This involves implementing certainty reporting architectures and ensuring diverse training data. While various distribution-based methods exist to provide safety mechanisms for AI models, there is a noted lack of systematic assessment of these methods, especially in the context of safety-critical automotive applications. Many methods in the literature do not adapt well to the quick response times required in safety-critical edge applications. This paper reviews these methods, discusses their suitability for safety-critical applications, and highlights their strengths and limitations. The paper also proposes potential improvements to enhance the safety and reliability of AI algorithms in autonomous vehicles in the context of rapid and accurate decision-making processes.

**ABSTRACT**  
Human learning is sensitive to rule-like structure and the curriculum of examples used for training. In tasks governed by succinct rules, learning is more robust when related examples are blocked across trials, but in the absence of such rules, interleaving is more effective. To date, no neural model has simultaneously captured these seemingly contradictory effects. Here we show that this same tradeoff spontaneously emerges with <b>"in-context</b> <b>learning"</b> <b>(ICL)</b> both in neural networks trained with metalearning and in <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> <b>(LLMs).</b> <b>ICL</b> is the ability to learn new tasks "in context" - without weight changes - via an inner-loop algorithm implemented in activation dynamics. Experiments with pretrained <b>LLMs</b> and metalearning <b>transformers</b> show that <b>ICL</b> exhibits the blocking advantage demonstrated in humans on a task involving rule-like structure, and conversely, that concurrent in-weight learning reproduces the interleaving advantage observed in humans on tasks lacking such structure.

**ABSTRACT**  
The knowledge concept <b>recommendation</b> in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) is a significant issue that has garnered widespread attention. Existing methods primarily rely on the explicit relations between users and knowledge concepts on the MOOC platforms for <b>recommendation.</b> However, there are numerous implicit relations (e.g., shared interests or same knowledge levels between users) generated within the users' learning activities on the MOOC platforms. Existing methods fail to consider these implicit relations, and these relations themselves are difficult to learn and represent, causing poor performance in knowledge concept <b>recommendation</b> and an inability to meet users' personalized needs. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework based on <b>contrastive</b> <b>learning,</b> which can represent and balance the explicit and implicit relations for knowledge concept <b>recommendation</b> in MOOCs (CL-KCRec). Specifically, we first construct a MOOCs heterogeneous information network (HIN) by modeling the data from the MOOC platforms. Then, we utilize a relation-updated <b>graph</b> <b>convolutional</b> <b>network</b> and stacked multi-channel <b>graph</b> <b>neural</b> <b>network</b> to represent the explicit and implicit relations in the HIN, respectively. Considering that the quantity of explicit relations is relatively fewer compared to implicit relations in MOOCs, we propose a <b>contrastive</b> <b>learning</b> with prototypical <b>graph</b> <b>to</b> <b>enhance</b> the representations of both relations to capture their fruitful inherent relational knowledge, which can guide the propagation of students' preferences within the HIN. Based on these enhanced representations, to ensure the balanced contribution of both towards the final <b>recommendation,</b> we propose a dual-head attention mechanism for balanced fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that CL-KCRec outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines on real-world datasets in terms of HR, NDCG and MRR.

**ABSTRACT**  
E-commerce platforms should provide detailed product descriptions (attribute values) for effective product search and <b>recommendation.</b> However, attribute value information is typically not available for new products. To predict unseen attribute values, <b>large</b> <b>quantities</b> <b>of</b> labeled training data are needed to train a traditional <b>supervised</b> <b>learning</b> model. Typically, it is difficult, time-consuming, and costly to manually label <b>large</b> <b>quantities</b> <b>of</b> new product profiles. In this paper, we propose a novel method to efficiently and effectively extract unseen attribute values from new products in the absence of labeled data <b>(zero-shot</b> setting). We propose HyperPAVE, a multi-label <b>zero-shot</b> attribute value extraction model that leverages inductive inference in heterogeneous hypergraphs. In particular, our proposed technique constructs heterogeneous hypergraphs to capture complex higher-order relations (i.e. user behavior information) to learn more accurate feature representations for <b>graph</b> nodes. Furthermore, our proposed HyperPAVE model uses an inductive link prediction mechanism to infer future connections between unseen nodes. This enables HyperPAVE to identify new attribute values without the need for labeled training data. We conduct extensive experiments with ablation studies on different categories of the MAVE dataset. The results demonstrate that our proposed HyperPAVE model significantly outperforms existing classification-based, generation-based <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> for attribute value extraction in the <b>zero-shot</b> setting.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Recommender</b> <b>Systems</b> (RS) have significantly advanced online content discovery and personalized decision-making. However, emerging vulnerabilities in RS have catalyzed a paradigm shift towards Trustworthy RS (TRS). Despite numerous progress on TRS, most of them focus on data correlations while overlooking the fundamental causal nature in <b>recommendation.</b> This drawback hinders TRS from identifying the cause in addressing trustworthiness issues, leading to limited <b>fairness,</b> robustness, and explainability. To bridge this gap, causal learning emerges as a class of promising methods to augment TRS. These methods, grounded in reliable causality, excel in mitigating various biases and noises while offering insightful explanations for TRS. However, there lacks a timely survey in this vibrant area. This paper creates an overview of TRS from the perspective of causal learning. We begin by presenting the advantages and common procedures of Causality-oriented TRS (CTRS). Then, we identify potential trustworthiness challenges at each stage and link them to viable causal solutions, followed by a classification of CTRS methods. Finally, we discuss several future directions for advancing this field.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper explores the usage of <b>multimodal</b> <b>image-to-text</b> models to enhance text-based item retrieval. We propose utilizing pre-trained image captioning and tagging models, such as instructBLIP and CLIP, to generate text-based product descriptions which are combined with existing text descriptions. Our work is particularly impactful for smaller eCommerce businesses who are unable to maintain the high-quality text descriptions necessary to effectively perform item retrieval for search and <b>recommendation</b> use cases. We evaluate the searchability of ground-truth text, image-generated text, and combinations of both texts on several subsets of Amazon's publicly available ESCI dataset. The results demonstrate the dual capability of our proposed models to enhance the retrieval of existing text and generate highly-searchable standalone descriptions.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Graph</b> Signal Processing (GSP) based <b>recommendation</b> algorithms have recently attracted lots of attention due to its high efficiency. However, these methods failed to consider the importance of various interactions that reflect unique user/item characteristics and failed to utilize user and item high-order neighborhood information to model user preference, thus leading to sub-optimal performance. To address the above issues, we propose a frequency-aware <b>graph</b> signal processing method (FaGSP) for collaborative filtering. Firstly, we design a Cascaded Filter Module, consisting of an ideal high-pass filter and an ideal low-pass filter that work in a successive manner, to capture both unique and common user/item characteristics to more accurately model user preference. Then, we devise a Parallel Filter Module, consisting of two low-pass filters that can easily capture the hierarchy of neighborhood, to fully utilize high-order neighborhood information of users/items for more accurate user preference modeling. Finally, we combine these two modules via a linear model to further improve <b>recommendation</b> accuracy. Extensive experiments on six public datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method from the perspectives of prediction accuracy and training efficiency compared with state-of-the-art <b>GCN-based</b> <b>recommendation</b> methods and GSP-based <b>recommendation</b> methods.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper presents a study on the implementation of the author's Algorithm of <b>Recommendation</b> Sessions (ARS) in an operational e-commerce information system and analyses the basic parameters of the resulting <b>recommendation</b> system. It begins with a synthetic overview of <b>recommendation</b> systems, followed by a presentation of the proprietary ARS algorithm, which is based on <b>recommendation</b> sessions. A mathematical model of the <b>recommendation</b> session, constructed using <b>graph</b> and network theory, serves as the input for the ARS algorithm. This paper also explores <b>graph</b> structure representation methods and the implementation of a G <b>graph</b> (representing a set of <b>recommendation</b> sessions) in a relational database using the SQL standard. The ARS algorithm was implemented in a working e-commerce information system, leading to the development of a fully functional <b>recommendation</b> system adaptable to various e-commerce IT systems. The effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated by research on the <b>recommendation</b> system's parameters presented in the final section of the paper.

<b>Large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> <b>(LLMs)</b> are becoming more prevalent and have found a ubiquitous use in providing different forms of writing assistance. However, <b>LLM-powered</b> writing systems can frustrate users due to their limited personalization and control, which can be exacerbated when users lack experience with <b>prompt</b> engineering. We see design as one way to address these challenges and introduce GhostWriter, an AI-enhanced writing design probe where users can exercise enhanced agency and personalization. GhostWriter leverages <b>LLMs</b> to learn the user's intended writing style implicitly as they write, while allowing explicit teaching moments through manual style edits and annotations. We study 18 participants who use GhostWriter on two different writing tasks, observing that it helps users craft personalized <b>text</b> <b>generations</b> and empowers them by providing multiple ways to control the system's writing style. From this study, we present insights regarding people's relationship with AI-assisted writing and offer design <b>recommendations</b> for future work.

**ABSTRACT**  
We explored the viability of <b>Large</b> <b>Language</b> <b>Models</b> <b>(LLMs)</b> for triggering and personalizing content for Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) in digital health. JITAIs are being explored as a key mechanism for sustainable behavior change, adapting interventions to an individual's current context and needs. However, traditional rule-based and machine learning models for JITAI implementation face scalability and reliability limitations, such as lack of personalization, difficulty in managing multi-parametric systems, and issues with data sparsity. To investigate JITAI implementation via <b>LLMs,</b> we tested the contemporary overall performance-leading model <b>'GPT-4'</b> with examples grounded in the use case of fostering heart-healthy physical activity in outpatient cardiac rehabilitation. Three personas and five sets of context information per persona were used as a basis of triggering and personalizing JITAIs. Subsequently, we generated a total of 450 proposed JITAI decisions and message content, divided equally into JITAIs generated by 10 iterations with <b>GPT-4,</b> a baseline provided by 10 laypersons (LayPs), and a gold standard set by 10 healthcare professionals (HCPs). Ratings from 27 LayPs indicated that JITAIs generated by <b>GPT-4</b> were superior to those by HCPs and LayPs over all assessed scales: i.e., appropriateness, engagement, effectiveness, and professionality. This study indicates that <b>LLMs</b> have significant potential for implementing JITAIs as a building block of personalized or "precision" health, offering scalability, effective personalization based on opportunistically sampled information, and good acceptability.

**ABSTRACT**  
Hand gesture recognition is becoming a more prevalent mode of human-computer interaction, especially as cameras proliferate across everyday devices. Despite continued progress in this field, gesture customization is often underexplored. Customization is crucial since it enables users to define and demonstrate gestures that are more natural, memorable, and accessible. However, customization requires efficient usage of user-provided data. We introduce a method that enables users to easily design bespoke gestures with a monocular camera from one demonstration. We employ <b>transformers</b> and <b>meta-learning</b> <b>techniques</b> to address <b>few-shot</b> <b>learning</b> challenges. Unlike prior work, our method supports any combination of one-handed, two-handed, static, and dynamic gestures, including different viewpoints. We evaluated our customization method through a user study with 20 gestures collected from 21 participants, achieving up to 97% average recognition accuracy from one demonstration. Our work provides a viable path for vision-based gesture customization, laying the foundation for future advancements in this domain.

**ABSTRACT**  
When creating plans, policies, or applications for people, it is challenging for designers to think through the strategic ways that different people will behave. Recently, <b>Large</b> <b>Language</b> <b>Models</b> <b>(LLMs)</b> have been shown to create realistic <b>simulations</b> of human-like behavior based on personas. We build on this to investigate whether <b>LLMs</b> can simulate human strategic behavior. Human strategies are complex because they take into account social norms in addition to aiming to maximize personal gain. The ultimatum game is a classic economics experiment used to understand human strategic behavior in a social setting. It shows that people will often choose to "punish" other players to enforce social norms rather than to maximize personal profits. We test whether <b>LLMs</b> can replicate this complex behavior in <b>simulations.</b> We compare two architectures: single- and multi-agent <b>LLMs.</b> We compare their abilities to (1) simulate human-like actions in the ultimatum game, (2) simulate two player personalities, greedy and fair, and (3) create robust strategies that are logically complete and consistent with personality. Our evaluation shows the multi-agent architecture is much more accurate than single <b>LLMs</b> (88% vs. 50%) in simulating human strategy creation and actions for personality pairs. Thus there is potential to use <b>LLMs</b> to simulate human strategic behavior to help designers, planners, and policymakers perform preliminary exploration of how people behave in systems.

**ABSTRACT**  
Complex data analysis inherently seeks unexpected insights through exploratory \re{visual analysis} methods, transcending logical, step-by-step processing. However, \re{existing interfaces such as notebooks and dashboards have limitations in exploration and comparison for visual data analysis}. Addressing these limitations, we introduce a "design-like" intelligent canvas environment integrating <b>generative</b> <b>AI</b> into data analysis, offering rapid prototyping, iteration, and comparative visualization management. Our dual contributions include the integration of <b>generative</b> <b>AI</b> components into a canvas interface, and empirical findings from a user study (N=10) evaluating the effectiveness of the canvas interface.

**ABSTRACT**  
While diversity has become a debated issue in design, very little research exists on positive use-cases for diversity beyond scholarly criticism. The current work addresses this gap through the case of a diversity-aware <b>chatbot,</b> exploring what benefits a diversity-aware <b>chatbot</b> could bring to people and how do people interpret diversity when being presented with it. In this paper, we motivate a Q&A <b>chatbot</b> as a technology probe and deploy it in two student communities within a study. During the study, we collected contextual data on people's expectations and perceptions when presented with diversity during the study. Our key findings show that people seek out others with shared niche interests, or their search is driven by exploration and inspiration when presented with diversity. Although interacting with <b>chatbots</b> is limited, participants found the engagement novel and interesting to motivate future research.

**ABSTRACT**  
Personal devices have adopted diverse authentication methods, including biometric recognition and passcodes. In contrast, headphones have limited input mechanisms, depending solely on the authentication of connected devices. We present Moonwalk, a novel method for passive user recognition utilizing the built-in headphone accelerometer. Our approach centers on gait recognition; enabling users to establish their identity simply by walking for a brief interval, despite the sensor's placement away from the feet. We employ <b>self-supervised</b> metric learning to train a model that yields a highly discriminative representation of a user's 3D acceleration, with no retraining required. We tested our method in a study involving 50 participants, achieving an average F1 score of 92.9% and equal error rate of 2.3%. We extend our evaluation by assessing performance under various conditions (e.g. shoe types and surfaces). We discuss the opportunities and challenges these variations introduce and propose new directions for advancing passive authentication for wearable devices.

**ABSTRACT**  
Psychological studies observe that emotions are rarely expressed in isolation and are typically influenced by the surrounding context. While recent studies effectively harness uni- and <b>multimodal</b> cues for emotion inference, hardly any study has considered the effect of long-term affect, or \emph{mood}, on short-term \emph{emotion} inference. This study (a) proposes time-continuous \emph{valence} prediction from videos, fusing <b>multimodal</b> cues including \emph{mood} and \emph{emotion-change} ($\Delta$) labels, (b) serially integrates spatial and channel attention for improved inference, and (c) demonstrates algorithmic generalisability with experiments on the \emph{EMMA} and \emph{AffWild2} datasets. Empirical results affirm that utilising mood labels is highly beneficial for dynamic valence prediction. Comparing \emph{unimodal} (training only with mood labels) vs \emph{multimodal} (training with mood and $\Delta$ labels) results, inference performance improves for the latter, conveying that both long and short-term contextual cues are critical for time-continuous emotion inference.

**ABSTRACT**  
Since its release in November 2022, <b>ChatGPT</b> has shaken up Stack Overflow, the premier platform for developers' queries on programming and software development. Demonstrating an ability to generate instant, human-like responses to technical questions, <b>ChatGPT</b> has ignited debates within the developer community about the evolving role of human-driven platforms in the age of <b>generative</b> <b>AI.</b> Two months after <b>ChatGPT's</b> release, Meta released its answer with its own <b>Large</b> <b>Language</b> <b>Model</b> <b>(LLM)</b> called <b>LLaMA:</b> the race was on. We conducted an empirical study analyzing questions from Stack Overflow and using these <b>LLMs</b> to address them. This way, we aim to (ii) measure user engagement evolution with Stack Overflow over time; (ii) quantify the reliability of <b>LLMs'</b> answers and their potential to replace Stack Overflow in the long term; (iii) identify and understand why <b>LLMs</b> fails; and (iv) compare <b>LLMs</b> together. Our empirical results are unequivocal: <b>ChatGPT</b> and <b>LLaMA</b> challenge human expertise, yet do not outperform it for some domains, while a significant decline in user posting activity has been observed. Furthermore, we also discuss the impact of our findings regarding the usage and development of new <b>LLMs.</b>

**ABSTRACT**  
To evaluate code <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> <b>(LLMs),</b> research has relied on a few small manually curated <b>benchmarks,</b> such as HumanEval and MBPP, which represent a narrow part of the real-world software domains. In this work, we introduce round-trip correctness (RTC) as an alternative evaluation method. RTC allows Code <b>LLM</b> evaluation on a broader spectrum of real-world software domains without the need for costly human curation. RTC rests on the idea that we can ask a model to make a prediction (e.g., describe some code using natural language), feed that prediction back (e.g., synthesize code from the predicted description), and check if this round-trip leads to code that is semantically equivalent to the original input. We show how to employ RTC to evaluate code synthesis and editing. We find that RTC strongly correlates with model performance on existing narrow-domain code synthesis <b>benchmarks</b> while allowing us to expand to a much broader set of domains and tasks which was not previously possible without costly human annotations.

**ABSTRACT**  
On-the-fly syntax highlighting is the task of rapidly associating visual secondary notation values with each character of a language derivation. Research in this domain is driven by the prevalence of online software development tools, which frequently display source code on screen and heavily rely on syntax highlighting mechanisms. In this context, three contrasting demands confront resolvers in this space: speed, accuracy, and development costs. Speed constraints are essential to ensure tool usability, manifesting as responsiveness for end users accessing online source code and minimising system overhead. Simultaneously, achieving precise highlighting is critical for enhancing code comprehensibility. Nevertheless, obtaining accurate results necessitates the capacity to perform grammatical analysis on the code under consideration, even in cases of varying grammatical correctness. Furthermore, addressing the development costs of such resolvers is imperative, given the multitude of programming language versions. The current state-of-the-art approach in this field leverages the original lexer and parser of programming languages to create syntax highlighting oracles, subsequently used for training base <b>Recurrent</b> <b>Neural</b> <b>Network</b> models. As the question of the generalisation of such a solution persists, this paper addresses this aspect by extending the original work to three additional mainstream programming languages and conducting a comprehensive review of the outcomes. Moreover, the original limitations in evaluation performance and training costs are mitigated through the introduction of a novel <b>Convolutional</b> based Neural Network model. This study examines the performance gains of running models on GPUs, finding that the new <b>CNN</b> implementation is much faster than previous methods while maintaining high accuracy.

**ABSTRACT**  
We present an approach using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to guide <b>Large</b> <b>Language</b> <b>Models</b> <b>(LLMs)</b> to generate verified programs in Dafny, Lean and Coq. Our method, which we call VMCTS, leverages the verifier inside the search algorithm by checking partial programs at each step. In combination with the <b>LLM</b> prior, the verifier feedback raises the synthesis capabilities of open source models. On a set of five verified programming problems, we find that in four problems where the base model cannot solve the question even when re-sampling solutions for one hour, VMCTS can solve the problems within 6 minutes. The base model with VMCTS is even competitive with ChatGPT4 augmented with plugins and multiple re-tries on these problems. Our code and <b>benchmarks</b> are available at https://github.com/namin/llm-verified-with-monte-carlo-tree-search .

**ABSTRACT**  
AI-based code assistants are promising tools that can facilitate and speed up code development. They exploit machine learning algorithms and natural language processing to interact with developers, suggesting code snippets (e.g., method implementations) that can be incorporated into projects. Recent studies empirically investigated the effectiveness of code assistants using simple exemplary problems (e.g., the re-implementation of well-known algorithms), which fail to capture the spectrum and nature of the tasks actually faced by developers. In this paper, we expand the knowledge in the area by comparatively assessing four popular AI-based code assistants, namely GitHub Copilot, Tabnine, <b>ChatGPT,</b> and Google <b>Bard,</b> with a dataset of 100 methods that we constructed from real-life open-source Java projects, considering a variety of cases for complexity and dependency from contextual elements. Results show that Copilot is often more accurate than other techniques, yet none of the assistants is completely subsumed by the rest of the approaches. Interestingly, the effectiveness of these solutions dramatically decreases when dealing with dependencies outside the boundaries of single classes.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Generative</b> <b>AI</b> is changing the way developers interact with software systems, providing services that can produce and deliver new content, crafted to satisfy the actual needs of developers. For instance, developers can ask for new code directly from within their IDEs by writing natural language <b>prompts,</b> and integrated services based on <b>generative</b> <b>AI,</b> such as Copilot, immediately respond to <b>prompts</b> by providing ready-to-use code snippets. Formulating the <b>prompt</b> appropriately, and incorporating the useful information while avoiding any information overload, can be an important factor in obtaining the right piece of code. The task of designing good <b>prompts</b> is known as <b>prompt</b> engineering. In this paper, we systematically investigate the influence of eight <b>prompt</b> features on the style and the content of <b>prompts,</b> on the level of correctness, complexity, size, and similarity to the developers' code of the generated code. We specifically consider the task of using Copilot with 124,800 <b>prompts</b> obtained by systematically combining the eight considered <b>prompt</b> features to generate the implementation of 200 Java methods. Results show how some <b>prompt</b> features, such as the presence of examples and the summary of the purpose of the method, can significantly influence the quality of the result.

**ABSTRACT**  
The microservices architectural style is widely favored for its scalability, reusability, and easy maintainability, <b>prompting</b> increased adoption by developers. However, transitioning from a monolithic to a microservices-based architecture is intricate and costly. In response, we present a novel method utilizing <b>clustering</b> to identify potential microservices in a given monolithic application. Our approach employs a density-based <b>clustering</b> algorithm considering static analysis, structural, and semantic relationships between classes, ensuring a functionally and contextually coherent partitioning. To assess the reliability of our microservice suggestion approach, we conducted an in-depth analysis of hyperparameter sensitivity and compared it with two established <b>clustering</b> algorithms. A comprehensive comparative analysis involved seven applications, evaluating against six baselines, utilizing a dataset of four open-source Java projects. Metrics assessed the quality of generated microservices. Furthermore, we meticulously compared our suggested microservices with manually identified ones in three microservices-based applications. This comparison provided a nuanced understanding of our approach's efficacy and reliability. Our methodology demonstrated promising outcomes, showcasing remarkable effectiveness and commendable stability.

**ABSTRACT**  
Case studies are a popular and noteworthy type of research study in software engineering, offering significant potential to impact industry practices by investigating phenomena in their natural contexts. This potential to reach a broad audience beyond the academic community is often undermined by deficiencies in reporting, particularly in the context description, study classification, generalizability, and the handling of validity threats. This paper presents a reflective analysis aiming to share insights that can enhance the quality and impact of case study reporting. We emphasize the need to follow established guidelines, accurate classification, and detailed context descriptions in case studies. Additionally, particular focus is placed on articulating generalizable findings and thoroughly discussing generalizability threats. We aim to encourage researchers to adopt more rigorous and communicative strategies, ensuring that case studies are methodologically sound, resonate with, and apply to software engineering practitioners and the broader academic community. The reflections and <b>recommendations</b> offered in this paper aim to ensure that insights from case studies are transparent, understandable, and tailored to meet the needs of both academic researchers and industry practitioners. In doing so, we seek to enhance the real-world applicability of academic research, bridging the gap between theoretical research and practical implementation in industry.

**ABSTRACT**  
Automatic Static Analysis Tools (ASATs) are widely used by software developers to diffuse and enforce coding practices. Yet, we know little about the documentation of ASATs, despite it being critical to learn about the coding practices in the first place. We shed light on this through several contributions. First, we analyze the documentation of more than 100 rules of 16 ASATs for multiple programming languages, and <b>distill</b> a taxonomy of the purposes of the documentation-What triggers a rule; Why it is important; and how to Fix an issue-and its types of contents. Then, we conduct a survey to assess the effectiveness of the documentation in terms of its goals and types of content. We highlight opportunities for improvement in ASAT documentation. In particular, we find that the Why purpose is missing in half of the rules we survey; moreover, when the Why is present, it is more likely to have quality issues than the What and the Fix.

**ABSTRACT**  
The advent of <b>generative</b> <b>artificial</b> intelligence and the widespread adoption of it in society engendered intensive debates about its ethical implications and risks. These risks often differ from those associated with traditional discriminative machine learning. To synthesize the recent discourse and map its normative concepts, we conducted a scoping review on the ethics of <b>generative</b> <b>artificial</b> intelligence, including especially <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>models</b> and <b>text-to-image</b> models. Our analysis provides a taxonomy of 378 normative issues in 19 topic areas and ranks them according to their prevalence in the literature. The study offers a comprehensive overview for scholars, practitioners, or policymakers, condensing the ethical debates surrounding <b>fairness,</b> safety, harmful content, hallucinations, privacy, interaction risks, security, alignment, societal impacts, and others. We discuss the results, evaluate imbalances in the literature, and explore unsubstantiated risk scenarios.

**ABSTRACT**  
Diffusion and Poisson flow models have demonstrated remarkable success for a wide range of generative tasks. Nevertheless, their iterative nature results in computationally expensive sampling and the number of function evaluations (NFE) required can be orders of magnitude larger than for single-step methods. Consistency models are a recent class of deep generative models which enable single-step sampling of high quality data without the need for <b>adversarial</b> <b>training.</b> In this paper, we introduce a novel image denoising technique which combines the flexibility afforded in Poisson flow generative models (PFGM)++ with the, high quality, single step sampling of consistency models. The proposed method first learns a trajectory between a noise distribution and the posterior distribution of interest by training PFGM++ in a <b>supervised</b> fashion. These pre-trained PFGM++ are subsequently <b>"distilled"</b> into Poisson flow consistency models (PFCM) via an updated version of consistency <b>distillation.</b> We call this approach posterior sampling Poisson flow consistency models (PS-PFCM). Our results indicate that the added flexibility of tuning the hyperparameter D, the dimensionality of the augmentation variables in PFGM++, allows us to outperform consistency models, a current state-of-the-art diffusion-style model with NFE=1 on clinical low-dose CT images. Notably, PFCM is in itself a novel family of deep generative models and we provide initial results on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

**ABSTRACT**  
Facial analysis has emerged as a prominent area of research with diverse applications, including cosmetic surgery programs, the beauty industry, photography, and entertainment. Manipulating patient images often necessitates professional image processing software. This study contributes by providing a model that facilitates the detection of blemishes and skin lesions on facial images through a <b>convolutional</b> <b>neural</b> <b>network</b> and machine learning approach. The proposed method offers advantages such as simple architecture, speed and suitability for image processing while avoiding the complexities associated with traditional methods. The model comprises four main steps: area selection, scanning the chosen region, lesion diagnosis, and marking the identified lesion. Raw data for this research were collected from a reputable clinic in Tehran specializing in skincare and beauty services. The dataset includes administrative information, clinical data, and facial and profile images. A total of 2300 patient images were extracted from this raw data. A software tool was developed to crop and label lesions, with input from two treatment experts. In the lesion preparation phase, the selected area was standardized to 50 * 50 pixels. Subsequently, a <b>convolutional</b> <b>neural</b> <b>network</b> model was employed for lesion labeling. The classification model demonstrated high accuracy, with a measure of 0.98 for healthy skin and 0.97 for lesioned skin specificity. Internal validation involved performance indicators and cross-validation, while external validation compared the model's performance indicators with those of the <b>transfer</b> <b>learning</b> method using the Vgg16 deep network model. Compared to existing studies, the results of this research showcase the efficacy and desirability of the proposed model and methodology.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Adversarial</b> <b>data</b> can lead to malfunction of deep learning applications. It is essential to develop deep learning models that are robust to <b>adversarial</b> <b>data</b> while accurate on standard, clean data. In this study, we proposed a novel adversarially robust feature learning (ARFL) method for a real-world application of breast cancer diagnosis. ARFL facilitates <b>adversarial</b> <b>training</b> using both standard data and <b>adversarial</b> <b>data,</b> where a feature correlation measure is incorporated as an objective function to encourage learning of robust features and restrain spurious features. To show the effects of ARFL in breast cancer diagnosis, we built and evaluated diagnosis models using two independent clinically collected breast imaging datasets, comprising a total of 9,548 mammogram images. We performed extensive experiments showing that our method outperformed several state-of-the-art methods and that our method can enhance safer breast cancer diagnosis against <b>adversarial</b> <b>attacks</b> in clinical settings.

**ABSTRACT**  
The U-net architecture has significantly impacted deep learning-based segmentation of medical images. Through the integration of long-range skip connections, it facilitated the preservation of high-resolution features. <b>Out-of-distribution</b> data can, however, substantially impede the performance of neural networks. Previous works showed that the trained network layers differ in their susceptibility to this domain shift, e.g., shallow layers are more affected than deeper layers. In this work, we investigate the implications of this observation of layer sensitivity to domain shifts of U-net-style segmentation networks. By copying features of shallow layers to corresponding decoder blocks, these bear the risk of re-introducing domain-specific information. We used a synthetic dataset to model different levels of data distribution shifts and evaluated the impact on downstream segmentation performance. We quantified the inherent domain susceptibility of each network layer, using the Hellinger distance. These experiments confirmed the higher domain susceptibility of earlier network layers. When gradually removing skip connections, a decrease in domain susceptibility of deeper layers could be observed. For downstream segmentation performance, the original U-net outperformed the variant without any skip connections. The best performance, however, was achieved when removing the uppermost skip connection - not only in the presence of domain shifts but also for in-domain test data. We validated our results on three clinical datasets - two histopathology datasets and one magnetic resonance dataset - with performance increases of up to 10% in-domain and 13% cross-domain when removing the uppermost skip connection.

**ABSTRACT**  
Optical imaging of the brain has expanded dramatically in the past two decades. New optics, indicators, and experimental paradigms are now enabling in-vivo imaging from the synaptic to the cortex-wide scales. To match the resulting flood of data across scales, computational methods are continuously being developed to meet the need of extracting biologically relevant information. In this pursuit, challenges arise in some domains (e.g., SNR and resolution limits in micron-scale data) that require specialized algorithms. These algorithms can, for example, make use of state-of-the-art machine learning to maximally learn the details of a given scale to optimize the processing pipeline. In contrast, other methods, however, such as <b>graph</b> signal processing, seek to abstract away from some of the details that are scale-specific to provide solutions to specific sub-problems common across scales of neuroimaging. Here we discuss limitations and tradeoffs in algorithmic design with the goal of identifying how data quality and variability can hamper algorithm use and dissemination.

**ABSTRACT**  
We study quantum neural networks made by parametric one-qubit gates and fixed two-qubit gates in the limit of infinite width, where the generated function is the expectation value of the sum of single-qubit observables over all the qubits. First, we prove that the probability distribution of the function generated by the untrained network with randomly initialized parameters converges in distribution to a <b>Gaussian</b> <b>process</b> whenever each measured qubit is correlated only with few other measured qubits. Then, we analytically characterize the training of the network via gradient descent with <b>square</b> <b>loss</b> on <b>supervised</b> <b>learning</b> problems. We prove that, as long as the network is not affected by barren plateaus, the trained network can perfectly fit the training set and that the probability distribution of the function generated after training still converges in distribution to a <b>Gaussian</b> <b>process.</b> Finally, we consider the statistical noise of the measurement at the output of the network and prove that a polynomial number of measurements is sufficient for all the previous results to hold and that the network can always be trained in polynomial time.

**ABSTRACT**  
We develop the theory of the edge coloring of infinite lattice <b>graphs,</b> proving a necessary and sufficient condition for a proper edge coloring of a patch of a lattice <b>graph</b> to induce a proper edge coloring of the entire lattice <b>graph</b> by translation. This condition forms the cornerstone of a method that finds nearly minimal or minimal edge colorings of infinite lattice <b>graphs.</b> In case a nearly minimal edge coloring is requested, the running time is $O(\mu^2 D^4)$, where $\mu$ is the number of edges in one cell (or `basis <b>graph')</b> of the lattice <b>graph</b> and $D$ is the maximum distance between two cells so that there is an edge from within one cell to the other. In case a minimal edge coloring is requested, we lack an upper bound on the running time, which we find need not pose a limitation in practice; we use the method to minimal edge color the meshes of all $k$-uniform tilings of the plane for $k\leq 6$, while utilizing modest computational resources. We find that all these lattice <b>graphs</b> are Vizing class~I. Relating edge colorings to quantum circuits, our work finds direct application by offering minimal-depth quantum circuits in the areas of quantum <b>simulation,</b> quantum optimization, and quantum state verification.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recent theoretical results in quantum machine learning have demonstrated a general trade-off between the expressive power of quantum neural networks (QNNs) and their trainability; as a corollary of these results, practical exponential separations in expressive power over classical machine learning models are believed to be infeasible as such QNNs take a time to train that is exponential in the model size. We here circumvent these negative results by constructing a hierarchy of efficiently trainable QNNs that exhibit unconditionally provable, polynomial memory separations of arbitrary constant degree over classical neural networks in performing a classical sequence modeling task. Furthermore, each unit cell of the introduced class of QNNs is computationally efficient, implementable in constant time on a quantum device. The classical networks we prove a separation over include well-known examples such as <b>recurrent</b> <b>neural</b> <b>networks</b> and <b>Transformers.</b> We show that quantum contextuality is the source of the expressivity separation, suggesting that other classical sequence learning problems with long-time correlations may be a regime where practical advantages in quantum machine learning may exist.

**ABSTRACT**  
Chest X-ray is a commonly used tool during triage, diagnosis and management of respiratory diseases. In resource-constricted settings, optimizing this resource can lead to valuable cost savings for the health care system and the patients as well as to and improvement in consult time. We used prospectively-collected data from 137 patients referred for chest X-ray at the Christian Medical Center and Hospital (CMCH) in Purnia, Bihar, India. Each patient provided at least five coughs while awaiting radiography. Collected cough sounds were analyzed using acoustic AI methods. Cross-validation was done on temporal and spectral features on the cough sounds of each patient. Features were <b>summarized</b> using standard statistical approaches. Three models were developed, tested and compared in their capacity to predict an abnormal result in the chest X-ray. All three methods yielded models that could discriminate to some extent between normal and abnormal with the <b>logistic</b> <b>regression</b> performing best with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curves ranging from 0.7 to 0.78. Despite limitations and its relatively small <b>sample</b> <b>size,</b> this study shows that AI-enabled algorithms can use cough sounds to predict which individuals presenting for chest radiographic examination will have a normal or abnormal results. These results call for expanding this research given the potential optimization of limited health care resources in low- and middle-income countries.

**ABSTRACT**  
Voice Activity Detection (VAD) and Overlapped Speech Detection (OSD) are key pre-processing tasks for speaker diarization. In the meeting context, it is often easier to capture speech with a distant device. This consideration however leads to severe performance degradation. We study a unified <b>supervised</b> <b>learning</b> framework to solve distant multi-microphone joint VAD and OSD (VAD+OSD). This paper investigates various multi-channel VAD+OSD front-ends that weight and combine incoming channels. We propose three algorithms based on the <b>Self-Attention</b> Channel Combinator (SACC), previously proposed in the literature. Experiments conducted on the AMI meeting corpus exhibit that channel combination approaches bring significant VAD+OSD improvements in the distant speech scenario. Specifically, we explore the use of learned complex combination weights and demonstrate the benefits of such an approach in terms of explainability. Channel combination-based VAD+OSD systems are evaluated on the final back-end task, i.e. speaker diarization, and show significant improvements. Finally, since multi-channel systems are trained given a fixed array configuration, they may fail in generalizing to other array set-ups, e.g. mismatched number of microphones. A channel-number invariant loss is proposed to learn a unique feature representation regardless of the number of available microphones. The evaluation conducted on mismatched array configurations highlights the robustness of this training strategy.

**ABSTRACT**  
With the rapid development of neural networks in recent years, the ability of various networks to enhance the magnitude spectrum of noisy speech in the single-channel speech enhancement domain has become exceptionally outstanding. However, enhancing the phase spectrum using neural networks is often ineffective, which remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we found that the human ear cannot sensitively perceive the difference between a precise phase spectrum and a biased phase (BP) spectrum. Therefore, we propose an optimization method of phase reconstruction, allowing freedom on the global-phase bias instead of reconstructing the precise phase spectrum. We applied it to a Conformer-based Metric <b>Generative</b> <b>Adversarial</b> <b>Networks</b> (CMGAN) baseline model, which relaxes the existing constraints of precise phase and gives the neural network a broader learning space. Results show that this method achieves a new state-of-the-art performance without incurring additional computational overhead.

**ABSTRACT**  
Effective DNA embedding remains crucial in genomic analysis, particularly in scenarios lacking labeled data for model <b>fine-tuning,</b> despite the significant advancements in genome <b>foundation</b> <b>models.</b> A prime example is metagenomics binning, a critical process in microbiome research that aims to group DNA sequences by their species from a complex mixture of DNA sequences derived from potentially thousands of distinct, often uncharacterized species. To fill the lack of effective DNA embedding models, we introduce DNABERT-S, a genome <b>foundation</b> <b>model</b> that specializes in creating species-aware DNA embeddings. To encourage effective embeddings to error-prone long-read DNA sequences, we introduce Manifold Instance Mixup (MI-Mix), a <b>contrastive</b> <b>objective</b> that mixes the hidden representations of DNA sequences at randomly selected layers and trains the model to recognize and differentiate these mixed proportions at the output layer. We further enhance it with the proposed Curriculum <b>Contrastive</b> <b>Learning</b> (C$^2$LR) strategy. Empirical results on 18 diverse datasets showed DNABERT-S's remarkable performance. It outperforms the top baseline's performance in 10-shot species classification with just a 2-shot training while doubling the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) in species <b>clustering</b> and substantially increasing the number of correctly identified species in metagenomics binning. The code, data, and pre-trained model are publicly available at https://github.com/Zhihan1996/DNABERT_S.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this study, we introduce a novel method for generating new synthetic samples that are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) from high-dimensional real-valued probability distributions, as defined implicitly by a set of Ground Truth (GT) samples. Central to our method is the integration of space-time mixing strategies that extend across temporal and spatial dimensions. Our methodology is underpinned by three interrelated stochastic processes designed to enable optimal transport from an easily tractable initial probability distribution to the target distribution represented by the GT samples: (a) linear processes incorporating space-time mixing that yield Gaussian conditional probability densities, (b) their bridge-diffusion analogs that are conditioned to the initial and final state vectors, and (c) nonlinear stochastic processes refined through score-matching techniques. The crux of our training regime involves <b>fine-tuning</b> the nonlinear model, and potentially the linear models - to align closely with the GT data. We validate the efficacy of our space-time diffusion approach with numerical experiments, laying the groundwork for more extensive future theory and experiments to fully authenticate the method, particularly providing a more efficient (possibly <b>simulation-free)</b> inference.

We also point out that several mathematical tasks that are at the core of the so-called compositional tasks thought to be hard for <b>LLMs</b> are unlikely to be solvable by <b>Transformers,</b> for <b>large</b> <b>enough</b> <b>instances</b> and assuming that certain well accepted conjectures in the field of Computational Complexity are true.

**ABSTRACT**  
Training Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) with small batches using <b>Stochastic</b> <b>Gradient</b> <b>Descent</b> <b>(SGD)</b> yields superior test performance compared to larger batches. The specific noise structure inherent to <b>SGD</b> is known to be responsible for this implicit bias. DP-SGD, used to ensure differential privacy (DP) in DNNs' training, adds Gaussian noise to the clipped gradients. Surprisingly, large-batch training still results in a significant decrease in performance, which poses an important challenge because strong DP guarantees necessitate the use of massive batches. We first show that the phenomenon extends to Noisy-SGD (DP-SGD without clipping), suggesting that the stochasticity (and not the clipping) is the cause of this implicit bias, even with additional isotropic Gaussian noise. We theoretically analyse the solutions obtained with continuous versions of Noisy-SGD for the Linear Least Square and Diagonal Linear Network settings, and reveal that the implicit bias is indeed amplified by the additional noise. Thus, the performance issues of large-batch DP-SGD training are rooted in the same underlying principles as <b>SGD,</b> offering hope for potential improvements in large batch training strategies.

**ABSTRACT**  
Doubly robust methods hold considerable promise for off-policy evaluation in Markov decision processes <b>(MDPs)</b> under sequential ignorability: They have been shown to converge as $1/\sqrt{T}$ with the horizon $T$, to be statistically efficient in large samples, and to allow for modular implementation where preliminary estimation tasks can be executed using standard <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning</b> techniques. Existing results, however, make heavy use of a strong distributional overlap assumption whereby the stationary distributions of the target policy and the data-collection policy are within a bounded factor of each other -- and this assumption is typically only credible when the state space of the MDP is bounded. In this paper, we re-visit the task of off-policy evaluation in <b>MDPs</b> under a weaker notion of distributional overlap, and introduce a class of truncated doubly robust (TDR) estimators which we find to perform well in this setting. When the distribution ratio of the target and data-collection policies is square-integrable (but not necessarily bounded), our approach recovers the large-sample behavior previously established under strong distributional overlap. When this ratio is not square-integrable, TDR is still consistent but with a slower-than-$1/\sqrt{T}$; furthermore, this rate of convergence is minimax over a class of <b>MDPs</b> defined only using mixing conditions. We validate our approach numerically and find that, in our experiments, appropriate truncation plays a major role in enabling accurate off-policy evaluation when strong distributional overlap does not hold.

**ABSTRACT**  
Evaluating <b>graphs</b> learned by causal discovery algorithms is difficult: The number of edges that differ between two <b>graphs</b> does not reflect how the <b>graphs</b> differ with respect to the identifying formulas they suggest for causal effects. We introduce a framework for developing causal distances between <b>graphs</b> which includes the structural intervention distance for directed acyclic <b>graphs</b> as a special case. We use this framework to develop improved adjustment-based distances as well as extensions to completed partially directed acyclic <b>graphs</b> and causal orders. We develop polynomial-time reachability algorithms to compute the distances efficiently. In our package gadjid (open source at https://github.com/CausalDisco/gadjid), we provide implementations of our distances; they are orders of magnitude faster than the structural intervention distance and thereby provide a success metric for causal discovery that scales to <b>graph</b> sizes that were previously prohibitive.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this paper, a type of novel projection-based, time-segmented reduced order model (ROM) is proposed for dynamic fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems based upon the arbitrary Lagrangian--Eulerian (ALE)-finite element method (FEM) in a monolithic frame, where spatially, each variable is separated from others in terms of their attribution (fluid/structure), category (velocity/pressure) and component (horizontal/vertical) while temporally, the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) bases are constructed in some deliberately partitioned time segments tailored through extensive numerical trials. By the combination of spatial and temporal decompositions, the developed ROM approach enables prolonged <b>simulations</b> under prescribed accuracy thresholds. Numerical experiments are carried out to compare numerical performances of the proposed ROM with corresponding full-order model (FOM) by solving a two-dimensional FSI <b>benchmark</b> problem that involves a vibrating elastic beam in the fluid, where the performance of offline ROM on perturbed physical parameters in the online phase is investigated as well. Extensive numerical results demonstrate that the proposed ROM has a comparable accuracy to while much higher efficiency than the FOM. The developed ROM approach is dimension-independent and can be seamlessly extended to solve high dimensional FSI problems.

**ABSTRACT**  
We study a two-sided online data ecosystem comprised of an online platform, users on the platform, and downstream learners or data buyers. The learners can buy user data on the platform (to run a statistic or machine learning task). Potential users decide whether to join by looking at the trade-off between i) their benefit from joining the platform and interacting with other users and ii) the privacy costs they incur from sharing their data. First, we introduce a novel modeling element for two-sided data platforms: the privacy costs of the users are endogenous and depend on how much of their data is purchased by the downstream learners. Then, we characterize marketplace equilibria in certain simple settings. In particular, we provide a full characterization in two variants of our model that correspond to different utility functions for the users: i) when each user gets a constant benefit for participating in the platform and ii) when each user's benefit is linearly increasing in the number of other users that participate. In both variants, equilibria in our setting are significantly different from equilibria when privacy costs are exogenous and fixed, highlighting the importance of taking endogeneity in the privacy costs into account. Finally, we provide <b>simulations</b> and semi-synthetic experiments to extend our results to more general assumptions. We experiment with different distributions of users' privacy costs and different functional forms of the users' utilities for joining the platform.

**ABSTRACT**  
Imagine you and a friend purchase identical items at a store, yet only your friend received a discount. Would your friend's discount make you feel unfairly treated by the store? And would you be less willing to purchase from that store again in the future? Based on a large-scale online survey that we ran on Prolific, it turns out that the answers to the above questions are positive. Motivated by these findings, in this work we propose a notion of individual <b>fairness</b> in online revenue management and an algorithmic module (called ``Grace Period'') that can be embedded in traditional revenue management algorithms and guarantee individual <b>fairness.</b> Specifically, we show how to embed the Grace Period in five common revenue management algorithms including Deterministic Linear Programming with Probabilistic Assignment, Resolving Deterministic Linear Programming with Probabilistic Assignment, Static Bid Price Control, Booking Limit, and Nesting, thus covering both stochastic and adversarial customer arrival settings. Embedding the Grace Period does not incur additional regret for any of these algorithms. This finding indicates that there is no tradeoff between a seller maximizing their revenue and guaranteeing that each customer feels fairly treated.

**ABSTRACT**  
Normal-form games (NFGs) are the fundamental model of strategic interaction. We study their representation using neural networks. We describe the inherent equivariance of NFGs -- any permutation of strategies describes an equivalent game -- as well as the challenges this poses for representation learning. We then propose the NfgTransformer architecture that leverages this equivariance, leading to state-of-the-art performance in a range of game-theoretic tasks including equilibrium-solving, deviation gain estimation and ranking, with a common approach to NFG representation. We show that the resulting model is interpretable and versatile, paving the way towards deep learning systems capable of game-theoretic <b>reasoning</b> when interacting with humans and with each other.

**ABSTRACT**  
Bounded rationality in mechanism design aims to ensure incentive-compatibility for agents who are cognitively limited. These agents lack the contingent <b>reasoning</b> skills that traditional mechanism design assumes, and depending on how these cognitive limitations are modelled this alters the class of incentive-compatible mechanisms. In this work we design mechanisms without any "obvious" manipulations for several auction settings that aim to either maximise revenue or minimise the compensation paid to the agents. A mechanism without obvious manipulations is said to be "not obviously manipulable" (NOM), and assumes agents act truthfully as long as the maximum and minimum utilities from doing so are no worse than the maximum and minimum utilities from lying, with the extremes taken over all possible actions of the other agents. We exploit the definition of NOM by introducing the concept of "golden tickets" and "wooden spoons", which designate bid profiles ensuring the mechanism's incentive-compatibility for each agent. We then characterise these "Willy Wonka" mechanisms, and by carefully choosing the golden tickets and wooden spoons we use this to design revenue-maximising auctions and frugal procurement auctions.

**ABSTRACT**  
We study repeated first-price auctions and general repeated Bayesian games between two players, where one player, the learner, employs a no-regret learning algorithm, and the other player, the optimizer, knowing the learner's algorithm, strategizes to maximize its own utility. For a commonly used class of no-regret learning algorithms called mean-based algorithms, we show that (i) in standard (i.e., full-information) first-price auctions, the optimizer cannot get more than the Stackelberg utility -- a standard <b>benchmark</b> in the literature, but (ii) in Bayesian first-price auctions, there are instances where the optimizer can achieve much higher than the Stackelberg utility. On the other hand, Mansour et al. (2022) showed that a more sophisticated class of algorithms called no-polytope-swap-regret algorithms are sufficient to cap the optimizer's utility at the Stackelberg utility in any repeated Bayesian game (including Bayesian first-price auctions), and they pose the open question whether no-polytope-swap-regret algorithms are necessary to cap the optimizer's utility. For general Bayesian games, under a reasonable and necessary condition, we prove that no-polytope-swap-regret algorithms are indeed necessary to cap the optimizer's utility and thus answer their open question. For Bayesian first-price auctions, we give a simple improvement of the standard algorithm for minimizing the polytope swap regret by exploiting the structure of Bayesian first-price auctions.

**ABSTRACT**  
Emerging cyber-physical systems impel the development of communication protocols to efficiently utilize resources. This paper investigates the optimal co-design of control and scheduling in networked control systems. The objective is to co-design the control law and the scheduling mechanism that jointly optimize the tradeoff between regulation performance and communication resource consumption in the long run. The concept of the value of information (VoI) is employed to evaluate the importance of data being transmitted. The optimal solution includes a certainty equivalent control law and a stationary scheduling policy based on the VoI function. The closed-loop system under the designed scheduling policy is shown to be stochastically stable. By analyzing the property of the VoI function, we show that the optimal scheduling policy is symmetric and is a monotone function when the system matrix is diagonal. Moreover, by the diagonal system matrix assumption, the optimal scheduling policy is shown to be of threshold type. Then we provide a simplified yet equivalent form of the threshold-based optimal scheduling policy. The threshold value searching region is also given. Finally, the numerical <b>simulation</b> illustrates the theoretical result of the VoI-based scheduling.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper presents a new swarm intelligence-based approach to deal with the cooperative path planning problem of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which is essential for the automatic inspection of infrastructure. The approach uses a 3D model of the structure to generate viewpoints for the UAVs. The calculation of the viewpoints considers the constraints related to the UAV formation model, camera parameters, and requirements for data post-processing. The viewpoints are then used as input to formulate the path planning as an extended traveling salesman problem and the definition of a new cost function. Ant colony optimization is finally used to solve the problem to yield optimal inspection paths. Experiments with 3D models of real structures have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. The results show that our system is not only capable of generating feasible inspection paths for UAVs but also reducing the path length by 29.47\% for complex structures when compared with another <b>heuristic</b> <b>approach.</b> The source code of the algorithm can be found at https://github.com/duynamrcv/aco_3d_ipp.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Multimodal</b> intelligent transportation systems (M-ITS) encompass a range of transportation services that utilise various modes of transport and incorporate intelligent technologies for enhanced efficiency and user experience. There are several challenges in M-ITS including data integration, Interoperability, scalability, user experience, etc. To address these challenges, such a system requires an adaptive system architecture that enables M-ITS to operate as an integrated ecosystem. In this paper, we provide an adaptive, user-centric, and layered architecture for <b>multimodal</b> transportation systems. The proposed architecture ensures scalability for seamless interactions of various subcomponents, that are often managed by different stakeholders. Concurrently, the data architecture is detailed, covering diverse data sources, advanced analytics, and stringent governance, providing a robust basis for intelligent decision-making. We provide two example use cases of the proposed architecture, showing how the data architecture and the system architecture can be fused and serve <b>multimodal</b> intelligent transport services.

**ABSTRACT**  
We consider the problem of designing a control policy for an infinite-horizon discounted cost <b>Markov</b> <b>decision</b> <b>process</b> $\mathcal{M}$ when we only have access to an approximate model $\hat{\mathcal{M}}$. How well does an optimal policy $\hat{\pi}^{\star}$ of the approximate model perform when used in the original model $\mathcal{M}$? We answer this question by bounding a weighted norm of the difference between the value function of $\hat{\pi}^\star $ when used in $\mathcal{M}$ and the optimal value function of $\mathcal{M}$. We then extend our results and obtain potentially tighter upper bounds by considering affine transformations of the per-step cost. We further provide upper bounds that explicitly depend on the weighted distance between cost functions and weighted distance between transition kernels of the original and approximate models. We present examples to illustrate our results.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this work, we present an open-source implementation of the enumerative sphere shaping (ESS) algorithm used for probabilistic constellation shaping (PCS). PCS aims at closing the shaping gap caused by using uniformly distributed modulation symbols in channels for which information theory shows non-uniformly distributed signaling to be optimal. ESS is one such PCS algorithm that sets itself apart as it operates on a trellis representation of a subset of the possible symbol sequences. ESS leads to an empirical distribution of the symbols that closely approximates the optimal distribution for the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. We provide an open-source implementation of this algorithm in the compiled language Rust, as well as Python bindings with which our Rust code can be called in a regular Python script. We also compare <b>simulation</b> results on the AWGN channel using our implementation with previous works on this topic.

**ABSTRACT**  
The constrained minimization (respectively maximization) of directed distances and of related generalized entropies is a fundamental task in information theory as well as in the adjacent fields of statistics, machine learning, artificial intelligence, signal processing and pattern recognition. In our previous paper "A precise bare <b>simulation</b> approach to the minimization of some distances. I. Foundations", we obtained such kind of constrained optima by a new dimension-free precise bare (pure) <b>simulation</b> method, provided basically that (i) the underlying directed distance is of f-divergence type, and that (ii) this can be connected to a light-tailed probability distribution in a certain manner. In the present paper, we extend this approach such that constrained optimization problems of a very huge amount of directed distances and generalized entropies -- and beyond -- can be tackled by a newly developed dimension-free extended bare <b>simulation</b> method, for obtaining both optima as well as optimizers. Almost no assumptions (like convexity) on the set of constraints are needed, within our discrete setup of arbitrary dimension, and our method is precise (i.e., converges in the limit). For instance, we cover constrained optimizations of arbitrary f-divergences, Bregman distances, scaled Bregman distances and weighted Euclidean distances. The potential for wide-spread applicability is indicated, too; in particular, we deliver many recent references for uses of the involved distances/divergences in various different research fields (which may also serve as an interdisciplinary interface).

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper considers opportunistic scheduler (OS) design using statistical channel state information~(CSI). We apply max-weight schedulers (MWSs) to maximize a utility function of users' average data rates. MWSs schedule the user with the highest weighted instantaneous data rate every time slot. Existing methods require hundreds of time slots to adjust the MWS's weights according to the instantaneous CSI before finding the optimal weights that maximize the utility function. In contrast, our MWS design requires few slots for estimating the statistical CSI. Specifically, we formulate a weight optimization problem using the mean and variance of users' signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) to construct constraints bounding users' feasible average rates. Here, the utility function is the formulated objective, and the MWS's weights are optimization variables. We develop an iterative solver for the problem and prove that it finds the optimal weights. We also design an online architecture where the solver adaptively generates optimal weights for networks with varying mean and variance of the SNRs. <b>Simulations</b> show that our methods effectively require $4\sim10$ times fewer slots to find the optimal weights and achieve $5\sim15\%$ better average rates than the existing methods.

**ABSTRACT**  
Asynchronous distributed hybrid beamformers (ADBF) are conceived for minimizing the total transmit power subject to signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints at the users. Our design requires only limited information exchange between the base stations (BSs) of the mmWave multi-cell coordinated (MCC) networks considered. To begin with, a semidefinite relaxation (SDR)-based fully-digital (FD) beamformer is designed for a centralized MCC system. Subsequently, a Bayesian learning (BL) technique is harnessed for decomposing the FD beamformer into its analog and baseband components and construct a hybrid transmit precoder (TPC). However, the centralized TPC design requires global channel state information (CSI), hence it results in a high signaling overhead. An alternating direction based method of multipliers (ADMM) technique is developed for a synchronous distributed beamformer (SDBF) design, which relies only on limited information exchange among the BSs, thus reducing the signaling overheads required by the centralized TPC design procedure. However, the SDBF design is challenging, since it requires the updates from the BSs to be strictly synchronized. As a remedy, an ADBF framework is developed that mitigates the inter-cell interference (ICI) and also control the asynchrony in the system. Furthermore, the above ADBF framework is also extended to the robust ADBF (R-ADBF) algorithm that incorporates the CSI uncertainty into the design procedure for minimizing the the worst-case transmit power. Our <b>simulation</b> results illustrate both the enhanced performance and the improved convergence properties of the ADMM-based ADBF and R-ADBF schemes.

**ABSTRACT**  
Stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIM) are capable of emulating reconfigurable physical neural networks by relying on electromagnetic (EM) waves as carriers. They can also perform various complex computational and signal processing tasks. A SIM is fabricated by densely integrating multiple metasurface layers, each consisting of a large number of small meta-atoms that can control the EM waves passing through it. In this paper, we harness a SIM for two-dimensional (2D) direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation. In contrast to the conventional designs, an advanced SIM in front of the receiver array automatically carries out the 2D discrete Fourier transform (DFT) as the incident waves propagate through it. As a result, the receiver array directly observes the angular spectrum of the incoming signal. In this context, the DOA estimates can be readily obtained by using probes to detect the energy distribution on the receiver array. This avoids the need for power-thirsty radio frequency (RF) chains. To enable SIM to perform the 2D DFT, we formulate the optimization problem of minimizing the fitting error between the SIM's EM response and the 2D DFT matrix. Furthermore, a gradient descent algorithm is customized for iteratively updating the phase shift of each meta-atom in SIM. To further improve the DOA estimation accuracy, we configure the phase shift pattern in the zeroth layer of the SIM to generate a set of 2D DFT matrices associated with orthogonal spatial frequency bins. Additionally, we analytically evaluate the performance of the proposed SIM-based DOA estimator by deriving a tight upper bound for the mean square error (MSE). Our numerical <b>simulations</b> verify the capability of a well-trained SIM to perform DOA estimation and corroborate our theoretical analysis. It is demonstrated that a SIM having an optical computational speed achieves an MSE of $10^{-4}$ for DOA estimation.

**ABSTRACT**  
We present an information-theoretic lower bound for the problem of parameter estimation with time-uniform coverage guarantees. Via a new a reduction to sequential testing, we obtain stronger lower bounds that capture the hardness of the time-uniform setting. In the case of location model estimation, <b>logistic</b> <b>regression,</b> and exponential family models, our $\Omega(\sqrt{n^{-1}\log \log n})$ lower bound is sharp to within constant factors in typical settings.

**ABSTRACT**  
Since its introduction in 2011, the partial information decomposition (PID) has triggered an explosion of interest in the field of multivariate information theory and the study of emergent, higher-order ("synergistic") interactions in complex systems. Despite its power, however, the PID has a number of limitations that restrict its general applicability: it scales poorly with system size and the standard approach to decomposition hinges on a definition of "redundancy", leaving synergy only vaguely defined as "that information not redundant." Other heuristic measures, such as the O-information, have been introduced, although these measures typically only provided a summary statistic of redundancy/synergy dominance, rather than direct insight into the synergy itself. To address this issue, we present an alternative decomposition that is synergy-first, scales much more gracefully than the PID, and has a straightforward interpretation. Our approach defines synergy as that information in a set that would be lost following the minimally invasive perturbation on any single element. By generalizing this idea to sets of elements, we construct a totally ordered "backbone" of partial synergy atoms that sweeps systems scales. Our approach starts with entropy, but can be generalized to the Kullback-Leibler divergence, and by extension, to the total correlation and the single-target <b>mutual</b> <b>information.</b> Finally, we show that this approach can be used to decompose higher-order interactions beyond just information theory: we demonstrate this by showing how synergistic combinations of pairwise edges in a complex network supports signal communicability and global integration. We conclude by discussing how this perspective on synergistic structure (information-based or otherwise) can deepen our understanding of part-whole relationships in complex systems.

**ABSTRACT**  
Sensor network virtualization enables the possibility of sharing common physical resources to multiple stakeholder applications. This paper focuses on addressing the dynamic adaptation of already assigned virtual sensor network resources to respond to time varying application demands. We propose an optimization framework that dynamically allocate applications into sensor nodes while accounting for the characteristics and limitations of the wireless sensor environment. It takes also into account the additional energy consumption related to activating new nodes and/or moving already active applications. Different objective functions related to the available energy in the nodes are analyzed. The proposed framework is evaluated by <b>simulation</b> considering realistic parameters from actual sensor nodes and deployed applications to assess the efficiency of the proposals.

**ABSTRACT**  
Artificial intelligence (AI) advances and the rapid adoption of <b>generative</b> <b>AI</b> tools like <b>ChatGPT</b> present new opportunities and challenges for higher education. While substantial literature discusses AI in higher education, there is a lack of a systemic approach that captures a holistic view of the AI transformation of higher education institutions (HEIs). To fill this gap, this article, taking a complex systems approach, develops a causal loop diagram (CLD) to map the causal feedback mechanisms of AI transformation in a typical HEI. Our model accounts for the forces that drive the AI transformation and the consequences of the AI transformation on value creation in a typical HEI. The article identifies and analyzes several reinforcing and balancing feedback loops, showing how, motivated by AI technology advances, the HEI invests in AI to improve student learning, research, and administration. The HEI must take measures to deal with academic integrity problems and adapt to changes in available jobs due to AI, emphasizing AI-complementary skills for its students. However, HEIs face a competitive threat and several policy traps that may lead to decline. HEI leaders need to become systems thinkers to manage the complexity of the AI transformation and benefit from the AI feedback loops while avoiding the associated pitfalls. We also discuss long-term scenarios, the notion of HEIs influencing the direction of AI, and directions for future research on AI transformation.

**ABSTRACT**  
Artificial intelligence (AI)-driven methods can vastly improve the historically costly drug design process, with various <b>generative</b> <b>models</b> already in widespread use. <b>Generative</b> <b>models</b> for de novo drug design, in particular, focus on the creation of novel biological compounds entirely from scratch, representing a promising future direction. Rapid development in the field, combined with the inherent complexity of the drug design process, creates a difficult landscape for new researchers to enter. In this survey, we organize de novo drug design into two overarching themes: small molecule and protein generation. Within each theme, we identify a variety of subtasks and applications, highlighting important datasets, <b>benchmarks,</b> and model architectures and comparing the performance of top models. We take a broad approach to AI-driven drug design, allowing for both micro-level comparisons of various methods within each subtask and macro-level observations across different fields. We discuss parallel challenges and approaches between the two applications and highlight future directions for AI-driven de novo drug design as a whole. An organized repository of all covered sources is available at https://github.com/gersteinlab/GenAI4Drug.

**ABSTRACT**  
Text-to-SQL systems (also known as NL-to-SQL systems) have become an increasingly popular solution for bridging the gap between user capabilities and SQL-based data access. These systems translate user requests in natural language to valid SQL statements for a specific database. Recent Text-to-SQL systems have benefited from the rapid improvement of <b>transformer-based</b> language models. However, while Text-to-SQL systems that incorporate such models continuously reach new high scores on -- often synthetic -- <b>benchmark</b> datasets, a systematic exploration of their robustness towards different data models in a real-world, realistic scenario is notably missing. This paper provides the first in-depth evaluation of the data model robustness of Text-to-SQL systems in practice based on a multi-year international project focused on Text-to-SQL interfaces. Our evaluation is based on a real-world deployment of FootballDB, a system that was deployed over a 9 month period in the context of the FIFA World Cup 2022, during which about 6K natural language questions were asked and executed. All of our data is based on real user questions that were asked live to the system. We manually labeled and translated a subset of these questions for three different data models. For each data model, we explore the performance of representative Text-to-SQL systems and language models. We further quantify the impact of training data size, pre-, and post-processing steps as well as language model inference time. Our comprehensive evaluation sheds light on the design choices of real-world Text-to-SQL systems and their impact on moving from research prototypes to real deployments. Last, we provide a new <b>benchmark</b> dataset to the community, which is the first to enable the evaluation of different data models for the same dataset and is substantially more challenging than most previous datasets in terms of query complexity.

**ABSTRACT**  
SPARQL CONSTRUCT queries allow for the specification of data processing pipelines that transform given input <b>graphs</b> into new output <b>graphs.</b> It is now common to constrain <b>graphs</b> through SHACL shapes allowing users to understand which data they can expect and which not. However, it becomes challenging to understand what <b>graph</b> data can be expected at the end of a data processing pipeline without knowing the particular input data: Shape constraints on the input <b>graph</b> may affect the output <b>graph,</b> but may no longer apply literally, and new shapes may be imposed by the query template. In this paper, we study the derivation of shape constraints that hold on all possible output <b>graphs</b> of a given SPARQL CONSTRUCT query. We assume that the SPARQL CONSTRUCT query is fixed, e.g., being part of a program, whereas the input <b>graphs</b> adhere to input shape constraints but may otherwise vary over time and, thus, are mostly unknown. We study a fragment of SPARQL CONSTRUCT queries (SCCQ) and a fragment of SHACL (Simple SHACL). We formally define the problem of deriving the most restrictive set of Simple SHACL shapes that constrain the results from evaluating a SCCQ over any input <b>graph</b> restricted by a given set of Simple SHACL shapes. We propose and implement an algorithm that statically analyses input SHACL shapes and CONSTRUCT queries and prove its soundness and complexity.

**ABSTRACT**  
We formally define the literature (reference) snowballing method and present a refined version of it. We show that the improved algorithm can substantially reduce curator work, even before application of <b>text</b> <b>classification,</b> by reducing the number of candidates to classify. We also present a desktop application named LitBall that implements this and other literature collection methods, through access to the Semantic Scholar academic <b>graph</b> (S2AG).

**ABSTRACT**  
The exponential growth in scientific publications poses a severe challenge for human researchers. It forces attention to more narrow sub-fields, which makes it challenging to discover new impactful research ideas and collaborations outside one's own field. While there are ways to predict a scientific paper's future citation counts, they need the research to be finished and the paper written, usually assessing impact long after the idea was conceived. Here we show how to predict the impact of onsets of ideas that have never been published by researchers. For that, we developed a large evolving <b>knowledge</b> <b>graph</b> built from more than 21 million scientific papers. It combines a semantic network created from the content of the papers and an impact network created from the historic citations of papers. Using machine learning, we can predict the dynamic of the evolving network into the future with high accuracy, and thereby the impact of new research directions. We envision that the ability to predict the impact of new ideas will be a crucial component of future artificial muses that can inspire new impactful and interesting scientific ideas.

**ABSTRACT**  
Generative modelling aims to accelerate the discovery of novel chemicals by directly proposing structures with desirable properties. Recently, score-based, or diffusion, generative models have significantly outperformed previous approaches. Key to their success is the close relationship between the score and physical force, allowing the use of powerful equivariant neural networks. However, the behaviour of the learnt score is not yet well understood. Here, we analyse the score by training an energy-based diffusion model for molecular generation. We find that during the generation the score resembles a restorative potential initially and a quantum-mechanical force at the end. In between the two endpoints, it exhibits special properties that enable the building of large molecules. Using insights from the trained model, we present Similarity-based Molecular Generation (SiMGen), a new method for zero shot molecular generation. SiMGen combines a time-dependent similarity kernel with descriptors from a pretrained machine learning force field to generate molecules without any further training. Our approach allows full control over the molecular shape through point cloud priors and supports conditional generation. We also release an interactive web tool that allows users to generate structures with SiMGen online (https://zndraw.icp.uni-stuttgart.de).

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Reasoning</b> abilities of human beings are limited. Logics that treat logical inference for human knowledge should reflect these limited abilities. Logic of awareness is one of those logics. In the logic, what an agent with a limited <b>reasoning</b> ability actually knows at a given moment (explicit knowledge) is distinguished from the ideal knowledge that an agent obtains by performing all possible inferences with what she already knows (implicit knowledge). This paper proposes a logic for explicit knowledge. In particular, we focus more on nested explicit knowledge, which means another agent's knowledge that an agent actually knows at a given moment. We develope a new formalization of two ideas and propose Kripke-style semantics. The first idea is the effect on an agent's <b>reasoning</b> ability by a state of an agent's awareness. We incorporate a relation on possible worlds called an indistinguishable relation to represent ignorance due to lack of awareness. The second idea is a state of each agent's awareness in the other agent's mind. We incorporate a non-empty finite sequence of agents called \textit{a chain of belief for awareness}. Our logic is called Awareness Logic with Partitions and Chains (ALPC). Employing an example, we show how nested explicit knowledge is formalized with our logic. Thereafter, we propose the proof system and prove the completeness. Finally, we discuss directions for extending and applying our logic and conclude. Our logic offers a foundation for a formal representation of human knowledge. We expect that the logic can be applied to computer science and game theory by describing and analyzing strategic behavior in a game and practical agent communication.

**ABSTRACT**  
In Statistical Arbitrage (StatArb), classical mean reversion trading strategies typically hinge on asset-pricing or PCA based models to identify the mean of a synthetic asset. Once such a (linear) model is identified, a separate mean reversion strategy is then devised to generate a trading signal. With a view of generalising such an approach and turning it truly data-driven, we study the utility of <b>Autoencoder</b> architectures in StatArb. As a first approach, we employ a standard <b>Autoencoder</b> trained on US stock returns to derive trading strategies based on the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process. To further enhance this model, we take a policy-learning approach and embed the <b>Autoencoder</b> network into a neural network representation of a space of portfolio trading policies. This integration outputs portfolio allocations directly and is end-to-end trainable by backpropagation of the risk-adjusted returns of the neural policy. Our findings demonstrate that this innovative end-to-end policy learning approach not only simplifies the strategy development process, but also yields superior gross returns over its competitors illustrating the potential of end-to-end training over classical two-stage approaches.

**ABSTRACT**  
We introduce a set of gradient-flow-guided adaptive importance sampling (IS) transformations to stabilize Monte-Carlo approximations of point-wise leave one out cross-validated (LOO) predictions for Bayesian classification models. One can leverage this methodology for assessing model generalizability by for instance computing a LOO analogue to the AIC or computing LOO ROC/PRC curves and derived metrics like the AUROC and AUPRC. By the calculus of variations and gradient flow, we derive two simple nonlinear single-step transformations that utilize gradient information to shift a model's pre-trained full-data posterior closer to the target LOO posterior predictive distributions. In doing so, the transformations stabilize importance weights. Because the transformations involve the gradient of the likelihood function, the resulting Monte Carlo integral depends on Jacobian determinants with respect to the model Hessian. We derive closed-form exact formulae for these Jacobian determinants in the cases of <b>logistic</b> <b>regression</b> and shallow ReLU-activated artificial neural networks, and provide a simple approximation that sidesteps the need to compute full Hessian matrices and their spectra. We test the methodology on an $n\ll p$ dataset that is known to produce unstable LOO IS weights.

**ABSTRACT**  
Signal processing in the time-frequency plane has a long history and remains a field of methodological innovation. For instance, detection and denoising based on the zeros of the spectrogram have been proposed since 2015, contrasting with a long history of focusing on larger values of the spectrogram. Yet, unlike neighboring fields like optimization and machine learning, time-frequency signal processing lacks widely-adopted <b>benchmarking</b> tools. In this work, we contribute an open-source, Python-based toolbox termed MCSM-Benchs for <b>benchmarking</b> multi-component signal analysis methods, and we demonstrate our toolbox on three time-frequency <b>benchmarks.</b> First, we compare different methods for signal detection based on the zeros of the spectrogram, including unexplored variations of previously proposed detection tests. Second, we compare zero-based denoising methods to both classical and novel methods based on large values and ridges of the spectrogram. Finally, we compare the denoising performance of these methods against typical spectrogram thresholding strategies, in terms of post-processing artifacts commonly referred to as musical noise. At a low level, the obtained results provide new insight on the assessed approaches, and in particular research directions to further develop zero-based methods. At a higher level, our <b>benchmarks</b> exemplify the benefits of using a public, collaborative, common framework for <b>benchmarking.</b>

**ABSTRACT**  
Several popular language models represent local contexts in an input text as bags of words. Such representations are naturally encoded by a sequence <b>graph</b> whose vertices are the distinct words occurring in x, with edges representing the (ordered) co-occurrence of two words within a sliding window of size w. However, this compressed representation is not generally bijective, and may introduce some degree of ambiguity. Some sequence <b>graphs</b> may admit several realizations as a sequence, while others may not admit any realization. In this paper, we study the realizability and ambiguity of sequence <b>graphs</b> from a combinatorial and computational point of view. We consider the existence and enumeration of realizations of a sequence <b>graph</b> under multiple settings: window size w, presence/absence of <b>graph</b> orientation, and presence/absence of weights (multiplicities). When w = 2, we provide polynomial time algorithms for realizability and enumeration in all cases except the undirected/weighted setting, where we show the #P-hardness of enumeration. For a window of size at least 3, we prove hardness of all variants, even when w is considered as a constant, with the notable exception of the undirected/unweighted case for which we propose an XP algorithms for both (realizability and enumeration) problems, tight due to a corresponding W[1]-hardness result. We conclude with an integer program formulation to solve the realizability problem, and with dynamic programming to solve the enumeration problem. This work leaves open the membership to NP for both problems, a non-trivial question due to the existence of minimum realizations having exponential size on the instance encoding.

**ABSTRACT**  
We design a randomized data structure that, for a fully dynamic <b>graph</b> $G$ updated by edge insertions and deletions and integers $k, d$ fixed upon initialization, maintains the answer to the Split Completion problem: whether one can add $k$ edges to $G$ to obtain a split <b>graph.</b> The data structure can be initialized on an edgeless $n$-vertex <b>graph</b> in time $n \cdot (k d \cdot \log n)^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$, and the amortized time complexity of an update is $5^k \cdot (k d \cdot \log n)^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$. The answer provided by the data structure is correct with probability $1-\mathcal{O}(n^{-d})$.

**ABSTRACT**  
We investigate fine-grained algorithmic aspects of identification problems in <b>graphs</b> and set systems, with a focus on Locating-Dominating Set and Test Cover. We prove, among other things, the following three (tight) conditional lower bounds. \begin{enumerate} \item \textsc{Locating-Dominating Set} does not admit an algorithm running in time $2^{o(k^2)} \cdot poly(n)$, nor a polynomial time kernelization algorithm that reduces the solution size and outputs a kernel with $2^{o(k)}$ vertices, unless the \ETH\ fails. \end{enumerate} To the best of our knowledge, \textsc{Locating-Dominating Set} is the first problem that admits such an algorithmic lower-bound (with a quadratic function in the exponent) when parameterized by the solution size. \begin{enumerate}[resume] \item \textsc{Test Cover} does not admit an algorithm running in time $2^{2^{o(k)}} \cdot poly(|U| + |\calF|)$. \end{enumerate} After \textsc{Edge Clique Cover} and \textsc{BiClique Cover}, this is the only example that we know of that admits a double exponential lower bound when parameterized by the solution size. \begin{enumerate}[resume] \item \textsc{Locating-Dominating Set} (respectively, \textsc{Test Cover}) parameterized by the treewidth of the input <b>graph</b> (respectively, of the natural auxiliary <b>graph)</b> does not admit an algorithm running in time $2^{2^{o(\tw)}} \cdot poly(n)$ (respectively, $2^{2^{o(\tw)}} \cdot poly(|U| + |\calF|))$. \end{enumerate} This result augments the small list of NP-Complete problems that admit double exponential lower bounds when parameterized by treewidth. We also present algorithms whose running times match the above lower bounds. We also investigate the parameterizations by several other structural <b>graph</b> parameters, answering some open problems from the literature.

**ABSTRACT**  
We design a Quasi-Polynomial time deterministic approximation algorithm for computing the integral of a multi-dimensional separable function, supported by some underlying hyper-graph structure, appropriately defined. Equivalently, our integral is the partition function of a graphical model with continuous potentials. While randomized algorithms for high-dimensional integration are widely known, deterministic counterparts generally do not exist. We use the correlation decay method applied to the Riemann sum of the function to produce our algorithm. For our method to work, we require that the domain is bounded and the hyper-edge potentials are positive and bounded on the domain. We further assume that upper and lower bounds on the potentials separated by a multiplicative factor of $1 + O(1/\Delta^2)$, where $\Delta$ is the maximum degree of the <b>graph.</b> When $\Delta = 3$, our method works provided the upper and lower bounds are separated by a factor of at most $1.0479$. To the best of our knowledge, our algorithm is the first deterministic algorithm for high-dimensional integration of a continuous function, apart from the case of trivial product form distributions.

**ABSTRACT**  
Given an edge-weighted metric complete <b>graph</b> with $n$ vertices, the maximum weight metric triangle packing problem is to find a set of $n/3$ vertex-disjoint triangles with the total weight of all triangles in the packing maximized. Several simple methods can lead to a 2/3-approximation ratio. However, this barrier is not easy to break. Chen et al. proposed a randomized approximation algorithm with an expected ratio of $(0.66768-\varepsilon)$ for any constant $\varepsilon>0$. In this paper, we improve the approximation ratio to $(0.66835-\varepsilon)$. Furthermore, we can derandomize our algorithm.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this report, we study the problem of Byzantine fault-tolerant distributed set intersection and the importance of redundancy in solving this problem. Specifically, consider a distributed system with $n$ agents, each of which has a local set. There are up to $f$ agents that are Byzantine faulty. The goal is to find the intersection of the sets of the non-faulty agents. We derive the Byzantine set intersection problem from the Byzantine optimization problem. We present the definition of $2f$-redundancy, and identify the necessary and sufficient condition if the Byzantine set intersection problem can be solved if a certain redundancy property is satisfied, and then present an equivalent condition. We further extend our results to arbitrary communication <b>graphs</b> in a decentralized setting. Finally, we present solvability results for the Byzantine optimization problem, inspired by our findings on Byzantine set intersection. The results we provide are for synchronous and asynchronous systems both.

**ABSTRACT**  
We consider a natural generalization of chordal <b>graphs,</b> in which every minimal separator induces a subgraph with independence number at most $2$. Such <b>graphs</b> can be equivalently defined as <b>graphs</b> that do not contain the complete bipartite <b>graph</b> $K_{2,3}$ as an induced minor, that is, <b>graphs</b> from which $K_{2,3}$ cannot be obtained by a sequence of edge contractions and vertex deletions. We develop a polynomial-time algorithm for recognizing these <b>graphs.</b> Our algorithm relies on a characterization of $K_{2,3}$-induced minor-free <b>graphs</b> in terms of excluding particular induced subgraphs, called Truemper configurations.

**ABSTRACT**  
For a field $\mathbb{F}$ and integers $d$ and $k$, a set of vectors of $\mathbb{F}^d$ is called $k$-nearly orthogonal if its members are non-self-orthogonal and every $k+1$ of them include an orthogonal pair. We prove that for every prime $p$ there exists a positive constant $\delta = \delta (p)$, such that for every field $\mathbb{F}$ of characteristic $p$ and for all integers $k \geq 2$ and $d \geq k^{1/(p-1)}$, there exists a $k$-nearly orthogonal set of at least $d^{\delta \cdot k^{1/(p-1)}/ \log k}$ vectors of $\mathbb{F}^d$. In particular, for the binary field we obtain a set of $d^{\Omega( k /\log k)}$ vectors, and this is tight up to the $\log k$ term in the exponent. For comparison, the best known lower bound over the reals is $d^{\Omega( \log k / \log \log k)}$ (Alon and Szegedy, <b>Graphs</b> and Combin., 1999). The proof combines probabilistic and spectral arguments.

**ABSTRACT**  
A set $C$ of vertices in a <b>graph</b> $G=(V,E)$ is an identifying code if it is dominating and any two vertices of $V$ are dominated by distinct sets of codewords. This paper presents a survey of Iiro Honkala's contributions to the study of identifying codes with respect to several aspects: complexity of computing an identifying code, combinatorics in binary Hamming spaces, infinite grids, relationships between identifying codes and usual parameters in <b>graphs,</b> structural properties of <b>graphs</b> admitting identifying codes, and number of optimal identifying codes.
