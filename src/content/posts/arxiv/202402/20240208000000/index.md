**ABSTRACT**  
No two authors write alike. Personal flourishes invoked in written narratives, from lexicon to rhetorical devices, imply a particular author--what literary theorists label the implied or virtual author; distinct from the real author or narrator of a text. Early large language models trained on unfiltered training sets drawn from a variety of discordant sources yielded incoherent personalities, problematic for conversational tasks but proving useful for sampling literature from multiple perspectives. Successes in alignment research in recent years have allowed researchers to impose subjectively consistent personae on language models via instruction tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), but whether aligned models retain the ability to model an arbitrary virtual author has received little scrutiny. By studying 4,374 stories sampled from three OpenAI language models, we show successive versions of GPT-3 suffer from increasing degrees of "mode collapse" whereby overfitting the model during alignment constrains it from generalizing over authorship: models suffering from mode collapse become unable to assume a multiplicity of perspectives. Our method and results are significant for researchers seeking to employ language models in sociological simulations.

**ABSTRACT**  
Effective communication between healthcare providers and patients is crucial to providing high-quality patient care. In this work, we investigate how Doctor-written and AI-generated texts in healthcare consultations can be classified using state-of-the-art embeddings and one-shot classification systems. By analyzing embeddings such as bag-of-words, character n-grams, Word2Vec, GloVe, fastText, and GPT2 embeddings, we examine how well our one-shot classification systems capture semantic information within medical consultations. Results show that the embeddings are capable of capturing semantic features from text in a reliable and adaptable manner. Overall, Word2Vec, GloVe and Character n-grams embeddings performed well, indicating their suitability for modeling targeted to this task. GPT2 embedding also shows notable performance, indicating its suitability for models tailored to this task as well. Our machine learning architectures significantly improved the quality of health conversations when training data are scarce, improving communication between patients and healthcare providers.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recent advances in machine learning have significantly impacted the field of information extraction, with Large Language Models (LLMs) playing a pivotal role in extracting structured information from unstructured text. This paper explores the challenges and limitations of current methodologies in structured entity extraction and introduces a novel approach to address these issues. We contribute to the field by first introducing and formalizing the task of Structured Entity Extraction (SEE), followed by proposing Approximate Entity Set OverlaP (AESOP) Metric designed to appropriately assess model performance on this task. Later, we propose a new model that harnesses the power of LLMs for enhanced effectiveness and efficiency through decomposing the entire extraction task into multiple stages. Quantitative evaluation and human side-by-side evaluation confirm that our model outperforms baselines, offering promising directions for future advancements in structured entity extraction.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper introduces the Definite Finite Automaton augmented large language model (DFA-LLM), a novel framework designed to enhance the capabilities of conversational agents using large language models (LLMs). Traditional LLMs face challenges in generating regulated and compliant responses in special scenarios with predetermined response guidelines, like emotional support and customer service. Our framework addresses these challenges by embedding a Definite Finite Automaton (DFA), learned from training dialogues, within the LLM. This structured approach enables the LLM to adhere to a deterministic response pathway, guided by the DFA. The advantages of DFA-LLM include an interpretable structure through human-readable DFA, context-aware retrieval for responses in conversations, and plug-and-play compatibility with existing LLMs. Extensive benchmarks validate DFA-LLM's effectiveness, indicating its potential as a valuable contribution to the conversational agent.

**ABSTRACT**  
Personalization in large language models (LLMs) is increasingly important, aiming to align LLM's interactions, content, and recommendations with individual user preferences. Recent advances in LLM personalization have spotlighted effective prompt design, by enriching user queries with non-parametric knowledge through behavior history retrieval and textual profiles. However, these approaches were limited due to a lack of model ownership, resulting in constrained customization and privacy issues. Moreover, they often failed to accurately capture user behavior patterns, especially in cases where user data were complex and dynamic. To address these shortcomings, we introduce One PEFT Per User (OPPU), which employs personalized parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) modules, to store user-specific behavior patterns and preferences. By plugging in users' personal PEFT parameters, they can own and use their LLMs personally. OPPU integrates parametric user knowledge in the personal PEFT parameters with the non-parametric knowledge acquired through retrieval and profile. This integration adapts individual LLMs to user behavior shifts. Experimental results demonstrate that OPPU significantly outperforms existing prompt-based methods across seven diverse tasks in the LaMP benchmark. Further in-depth studies reveal OPPU's enhanced capabilities in handling user behavior shifts, modeling users at different active levels, maintaining robustness across various user history formats, and displaying versatility with different PEFT methods.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this study, we focus on two main tasks, the first for detecting legal violations within unstructured textual data, and the second for associating these violations with potentially affected individuals. We constructed two datasets using Large Language Models (LLMs) which were subsequently validated by domain expert annotators. Both tasks were designed specifically for the context of class-action cases. The experimental design incorporated fine-tuning models from the BERT family and open-source LLMs, and conducting few-shot experiments using closed-source LLMs. Our results, with an F1-score of 62.69\% (violation identification) and 81.02\% (associating victims), show that our datasets and setups can be used for both tasks. Finally, we publicly release the datasets and the code used for the experiments in order to advance further research in the area of legal natural language processing (NLP).

**ABSTRACT**  
While recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have proven useful in answering user queries, they are prone to hallucination, and their responses often lack credibility due to missing references to reliable sources. An intuitive solution to these issues would be to include in-text citations referring to external documents as evidence. While previous works have directly prompted LLMs to generate in-text citations, their performances are far from satisfactory, especially when it comes to smaller LLMs. In this work, we propose an effective training framework using fine-grained rewards to teach LLMs to generate highly supportive and relevant citations, while ensuring the correctness of their responses. We also conduct a systematic analysis of applying these fine-grained rewards to common LLM training strategies, demonstrating its advantage over conventional practices. We conduct extensive experiments on Question Answering (QA) datasets taken from the ALCE benchmark and validate the model's generalizability using EXPERTQA. On LLaMA-2-7B, the incorporation of fine-grained rewards achieves the best performance among the baselines, even surpassing that of GPT-3.5-turbo.

**ABSTRACT**  
We introduce AnyTool, a large language model agent designed to revolutionize the utilization of a vast array of tools in addressing user queries. We utilize over 16,000 APIs from Rapid API, operating under the assumption that a subset of these APIs could potentially resolve the queries. AnyTool primarily incorporates three elements: an API retriever with a hierarchical structure, a solver aimed at resolving user queries using a selected set of API candidates, and a self-reflection mechanism, which re-activates AnyTool if the initial solution proves impracticable. AnyTool is powered by the function calling feature of GPT-4, eliminating the need for training external modules. We also revisit the evaluation protocol introduced by previous works and identify a limitation in this protocol that leads to an artificially high pass rate. By revising the evaluation protocol to better reflect practical application scenarios, we introduce an additional benchmark, termed AnyToolBench. Experiments across various datasets demonstrate the superiority of our AnyTool over strong baselines such as ToolLLM and a GPT-4 variant tailored for tool utilization. For instance, AnyTool outperforms ToolLLM by +35.4% in terms of average pass rate on ToolBench. Code will be available at https://github.com/dyabel/AnyTool.

**ABSTRACT**  
Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding is a text generation technique that has been shown to improve the quality of machine translations, but is expensive, even if a sampling-based approximation is used. Besides requiring a large number of sampled sequences, it requires the pairwise calculation of a utility metric, which has quadratic complexity. In this paper, we propose to approximate pairwise metric scores with scores calculated against aggregated reference representations. This changes the complexity of utility estimation from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$, while empirically preserving most of the quality gains of MBR decoding. We release our source code at https://github.com/ZurichNLP/mbr

**ABSTRACT**  
The NLP research community has devoted increased attention to languages beyond English, resulting in considerable improvements for multilingual NLP. However, these improvements only apply to a small subset of the world's languages. Aiming to extend this, an increasing number of papers aspires to enhance generalizable multilingual performance across languages. To this end, linguistic typology is commonly used to motivate language selection, on the basis that a broad typological sample ought to imply generalization across a broad range of languages. These selections are often described as being 'typologically diverse'. In this work, we systematically investigate NLP research that includes claims regarding 'typological diversity'. We find there are no set definitions or criteria for such claims. We introduce metrics to approximate the diversity of language selection along several axes and find that the results vary considerably across papers. Furthermore, we show that skewed language selection can lead to overestimated multilingual performance. We recommend future work to include an operationalization of 'typological diversity' that empirically justifies the diversity of language samples.

**ABSTRACT**  
Scaling laws provide important insights that can guide the design of large language models (LLMs). Existing work has primarily focused on studying scaling laws for pretraining (upstream) loss. However, in transfer learning settings, in which LLMs are pretrained on an unsupervised dataset and then finetuned on a downstream task, we often also care about the downstream performance. In this work, we study the scaling behavior in a transfer learning setting, where LLMs are finetuned for machine translation tasks. Specifically, we investigate how the choice of the pretraining data and its size affect downstream performance (translation quality) as judged by two metrics: downstream cross-entropy and BLEU score. Our experiments indicate that the size of the finetuning dataset and the distribution alignment between the pretraining and downstream data significantly influence the scaling behavior. With sufficient alignment, both downstream cross-entropy and BLEU score improve monotonically with more pretraining data. In such cases, we show that it is possible to predict the downstream BLEU score with good accuracy using a log-law. However, there are also cases where moderate misalignment causes the BLEU score to fluctuate or get worse with more pretraining, whereas downstream cross-entropy monotonically improves. By analyzing these observations, we provide new practical insights for choosing appropriate pretraining data.

**ABSTRACT**  
Controllable text generation is a growing field within natural language generation (NLG) that focuses on producing text that meets specific constraints in real-world applications. Previous approaches, such as plug-and-play controllers (PPCs), aimed to steer the properties of generated text in a flexible manner. However, these methods often compromised the integrity of the language model's decoding process, resulting in less smooth text generation. Alternatively, other techniques utilized multiple attribute prompts to align the generated text with desired attributes, but this approach required prompt design for each attribute and was dependent on the size of the language model. This paper introduces a novel method for flexible attribute control in text generation using pre-trained language models (PLMs). The proposed approach aims to enhance the fluency of generated text by guiding the generation process with PPCs. The key idea is to dynamically adjust the distribution of generated text by modifying prompts, effectively constraining the output space of the language model and influencing the desired attribute. To enable smooth cooperation between the PLM and the PPC, our work innovatively proposes a new model fine-tuning method: Reinforcement Learning with Dynamic Adjust Feedback (RLDAF).This fine-tuning process adapts a small subset of the language model's parameters based on the generating actions taken during the PPC control process. The resulting harmonious collaboration between the PLM and PPC leads to improved smoothness in text generation during inference. Extensive experiments were conducted on the SST2 dataset, and the proposed method outperformed previous approaches in various evaluation metrics, including text fluency and attribute consistency.

**ABSTRACT**  
ChatGPT is notorious for its intransparent behavior. This paper tries to shed light on this, providing an in-depth analysis of the dark personality traits and conspiracy beliefs of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. Different psychological tests and questionnaires were employed, including the Dark Factor Test, the Mach-IV Scale, the Generic Conspiracy Belief Scale, and the Conspiracy Mentality Scale. The responses were analyzed computing average scores, standard deviations, and significance tests to investigate differences between GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. For traits that have shown to be interdependent in human studies, correlations were considered. Additionally, system roles corresponding to groups that have shown distinct answering behavior in the corresponding questionnaires were applied to examine the models' ability to reflect characteristics associated with these roles in their responses. Dark personality traits and conspiracy beliefs were not particularly pronounced in either model with little differences between GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. However, GPT-4 showed a pronounced tendency to believe in information withholding. This is particularly intriguing given that GPT-4 is trained on a significantly larger dataset than GPT-3.5. Apparently, in this case an increased data exposure correlates with a greater belief in the control of information. An assignment of extreme political affiliations increased the belief in conspiracy theories. Test sequencing affected the models' responses and the observed correlations, indicating a form of contextual memory.

**ABSTRACT**  
The dominance of social media has added to the channels of bullying for perpetrators. Unfortunately, cyberbullying (CB) is the most prevalent phenomenon in todays cyber world, and is a severe threat to the mental and physical health of citizens. This opens the need to develop a robust system to prevent bullying content from online forums, blogs, and social media platforms to manage the impact in our society. Several machine learning (ML) algorithms have been proposed for this purpose. However, their performances are not consistent due to high class imbalance and generalisation issues. In recent years, large language models (LLMs) like BERT and RoBERTa have achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in several natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Unfortunately, the LLMs have not been applied extensively for CB detection. In our paper, we explored the use of these models for cyberbullying (CB) detection. We have prepared a new dataset (D2) from existing studies (Formspring and Twitter). Our experimental results for dataset D1 and D2 showed that RoBERTa outperformed other models.

**ABSTRACT**  
This study introduces a novel teacher-student architecture utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve prostate cancer radiotherapy symptom extraction from clinical notes. Mixtral, the student model, initially extracts symptoms, followed by GPT-4, the teacher model, which refines prompts based on Mixtral's performance. This iterative process involved 294 single symptom clinical notes across 12 symptoms, with up to 16 rounds of refinement per epoch. Results showed significant improvements in extracting symptoms from both single and multi-symptom notes. For 59 single symptom notes, accuracy increased from 0.51 to 0.71, precision from 0.52 to 0.82, recall from 0.52 to 0.72, and F1 score from 0.49 to 0.73. In 375 multi-symptom notes, accuracy rose from 0.24 to 0.43, precision from 0.6 to 0.76, recall from 0.24 to 0.43, and F1 score from 0.20 to 0.44. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of advanced prompt engineering in LLMs for radiation oncology use.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recent advancements in natural language processing, especially the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), have opened exciting possibilities for constructing computational simulations designed to replicate human behavior accurately. However, LLMs are complex statistical learners without straightforward deductive rules, making them prone to unexpected behaviors. In this study, we highlight the limitations of LLMs in simulating human interactions, particularly focusing on LLMs' ability to simulate political debates. Our findings indicate a tendency for LLM agents to conform to the model's inherent social biases despite being directed to debate from certain political perspectives. This tendency results in behavioral patterns that seem to deviate from well-established social dynamics among humans. We reinforce these observations using an automatic self-fine-tuning method, which enables us to manipulate the biases within the LLM and demonstrate that agents subsequently align with the altered biases. These results underscore the need for further research to develop methods that help agents overcome these biases, a critical step toward creating more realistic simulations.

**ABSTRACT**  
The scarcity of available text corpora for low-resource languages like Albanian is a serious hurdle for research in natural language processing tasks. This paper introduces AlbNews, a collection of 600 topically labeled news headlines and 2600 unlabeled ones in Albanian. The data can be freely used for conducting topic modeling research. We report the initial classification scores of some traditional machine learning classifiers trained with the AlbNews samples. These results show that basic models outrun the ensemble learning ones and can serve as a baseline for future experiments.

**ABSTRACT**  
This study explores the use of Google Translate (GT) for translating mental healthcare (MHealth) information and evaluates its accuracy, comprehensibility, and implications for multilingual healthcare communication through analysing GT output in the MHealth domain from English to Persian, Arabic, Turkish, Romanian, and Spanish. Two datasets comprising MHealth information from the UK National Health Service website and information leaflets from The Royal College of Psychiatrists were used. Native speakers of the target languages manually assessed the GT translations, focusing on medical terminology accuracy, comprehensibility, and critical syntactic/semantic errors. GT output analysis revealed challenges in accurately translating medical terminology, particularly in Arabic, Romanian, and Persian. Fluency issues were prevalent across various languages, affecting comprehension, mainly in Arabic and Spanish. Critical errors arose in specific contexts, such as bullet-point formatting, specifically in Persian, Turkish, and Romanian. Although improvements are seen in longer-text translations, there remains a need to enhance accuracy in medical and mental health terminology and fluency, whilst also addressing formatting issues for a more seamless user experience. The findings highlight the need to use customised translation engines for Mhealth translation and the challenges when relying solely on machine-translated medical content, emphasising the crucial role of human reviewers in multilingual healthcare communication.

**ABSTRACT**  
State-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) are now claiming remarkable supported context lengths of 256k or even more. In contrast, the average context lengths of mainstream benchmarks are insufficient (5k-21k), and they suffer from potential knowledge leakage and inaccurate metrics, resulting in biased evaluation. This paper introduces LV-Eval, a challenging long-context benchmark with five length levels (16k, 32k, 64k, 128k, and 256k) reaching up to 256k words. LV-Eval features two main tasks, single-hop QA and multi-hop QA, comprising 11 bilingual datasets. The design of LV-Eval has incorporated three key techniques, namely confusing facts insertion, keyword and phrase replacement, and keyword-recall-based metric design. The advantages of LV-Eval include controllable evaluation across different context lengths, challenging test instances with confusing facts, mitigated knowledge leakage, and more objective evaluations. We evaluate 10 LLMs on LV-Eval and conduct ablation studies on the techniques used in LV-Eval construction. The results reveal that: (i) Commercial LLMs generally outperform open-source LLMs when evaluated within length levels shorter than their claimed context length. However, their overall performance is surpassed by open-source LLMs with longer context lengths. (ii) Extremely long-context LLMs, such as Yi-6B-200k, exhibit a relatively gentle degradation of performance, but their absolute performances may not necessarily be higher than those of LLMs with shorter context lengths. (iii) LLMs' performances can significantly degrade in the presence of confusing information, especially in the pressure test of "needle in a haystack". (iv) Issues related to knowledge leakage and inaccurate metrics introduce bias in evaluation, and these concerns are alleviated in LV-Eval. All datasets and evaluation codes are released at: https://github.com/infinigence/LVEval.

**ABSTRACT**  
Computation of document similarity is a critical task in various NLP domains that has applications in deduplication, matching, and recommendation. Traditional approaches for document similarity computation include learning representations of documents and employing a similarity or a distance function over the embeddings. However, pairwise similarities and differences are not efficiently captured by individual representations. Graph representations such as Joint Concept Interaction Graph (JCIG) represent a pair of documents as a joint undirected weighted graph. JCIGs facilitate an interpretable representation of document pairs as a graph. However, JCIGs are undirected, and don't consider the sequential flow of sentences in documents. We propose two approaches to model document similarity by representing document pairs as a directed and sparse JCIG that incorporates sequential information. We propose two algorithms inspired by Supergenome Sorting and Hamiltonian Path that replace the undirected edges with directed edges. Our approach also sparsifies the graph to $O(n)$ edges from JCIG's worst case of $O(n^2)$. We show that our sparse directed graph model architecture consisting of a Siamese encoder and GCN achieves comparable results to the baseline on datasets not containing sequential information and beats the baseline by ten points on an instructional documents dataset containing sequential information.

**ABSTRACT**  
Natural Language Processing (NLP) research is increasingly focusing on the use of Large Language Models (LLMs), with some of the most popular ones being either fully or partially closed-source. The lack of access to model details, especially regarding training data, has repeatedly raised concerns about data contamination among researchers. Several attempts have been made to address this issue, but they are limited to anecdotal evidence and trial and error. Additionally, they overlook the problem of \emph{indirect} data leaking, where models are iteratively improved by using data coming from users. In this work, we conduct the first systematic analysis of work using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, the most prominently used LLMs today, in the context of data contamination. By analysing 255 papers and considering OpenAI's data usage policy, we extensively document the amount of data leaked to these models during the first year after the model's release. We report that these models have been globally exposed to $\sim$4.7M samples from 263 benchmarks. At the same time, we document a number of evaluation malpractices emerging in the reviewed papers, such as unfair or missing baseline comparisons and reproducibility issues. We release our results as a collaborative project on https://leak-llm.github.io/, where other researchers can contribute to our efforts.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recently, Profile-based Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) has gained increasing attention, which aims to incorporate various types of supplementary profile information (i.e., Knowledge Graph, User Profile, Context Awareness) to eliminate the prevalent ambiguities in user utterances. However, existing approaches can only separately model different profile information, without considering their interrelationships or excluding irrelevant and conflicting information within them. To address the above issues, we introduce a Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network to perform reasoning across multiple Profile information, called Pro-HAN. Specifically, we design three types of edges, denoted as intra-Pro, inter-Pro, and utterance-Pro, to capture interrelationships among multiple Pros. We establish a new state-of-the-art on the ProSLU dataset, with an improvement of approximately 8% across all three metrics. Further analysis experiments also confirm the effectiveness of our method in modeling multi-source profile information.

**ABSTRACT**  
Knowledge distillation (KD) is widely used for compressing a teacher model to a smaller student model, reducing its inference cost and memory footprint while preserving model capabilities. However, current KD methods for auto-regressive sequence models (e.g., large language models) suffer from missing a standardized objective function. Moreover, the recent use of student-generated outputs to address training-inference mismatches has significantly escalated computational costs. To tackle these issues, we introduce DistiLLM, a more effective and efficient KD framework for auto-regressive language models. DistiLLM comprises two components: (1) a novel skew Kullback-Leibler divergence loss, where we unveil and leverage its theoretical properties, and (2) an adaptive off-policy approach designed to enhance the efficiency in utilizing student-generated outputs. Extensive experiments, including instruction-following tasks, demonstrate the effectiveness of DistiLLM in building high-performing student models while achieving up to 4.3$\times$ speedup compared to recent KD methods.

**ABSTRACT**  
Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate ever-increasing abilities in mathematical and algorithmic tasks, yet their geometric reasoning skills are underexplored. We investigate LLMs' abilities in constructive geometric problem-solving one of the most fundamental steps in the development of human mathematical reasoning. Our work reveals notable challenges that the state-of-the-art LLMs face in this domain despite many successes in similar areas. LLMs exhibit biases in target variable selection and struggle with 2D spatial relationships, often misrepresenting and hallucinating objects and their placements. To this end, we introduce a framework that formulates an LLMs-based multi-agents system that enhances their existing reasoning potential by conducting an internal dialogue. This work underscores LLMs' current limitations in geometric reasoning and improves geometric reasoning capabilities through self-correction, collaboration, and diverse role specializations.

**ABSTRACT**  
Traditionally, discriminative models have been the predominant choice for tasks like document classification and information extraction. These models make predictions that fall into a limited number of predefined classes, facilitating a binary true or false evaluation and enabling the direct calculation of metrics such as the F1 score. However, recent advancements in generative large language models (GLLMs) have prompted a shift in the field due to their enhanced zero-shot capabilities, which eliminate the need for a downstream dataset and computationally expensive fine-tuning. However, evaluating GLLMs presents a challenge as the binary true or false evaluation used for discriminative models is not applicable to the predictions made by GLLMs. This paper introduces a new metric for generative models called ANLS* for evaluating a wide variety of tasks, including information extraction and classification tasks. The ANLS* metric extends existing ANLS metrics as a drop-in-replacement and is still compatible with previously reported ANLS scores. An evaluation of 7 different datasets and 3 different GLLMs using the ANLS* metric is also provided, demonstrating the importance of the proposed metric. We also benchmark a novel approach to generate prompts for documents, called SFT, against other prompting techniques such as LATIN. In 15 out of 21 cases, SFT outperforms other techniques and improves the state-of-the-art, sometimes by as much as $15$ percentage points.

**ABSTRACT**  
Skill Extraction involves identifying skills and qualifications mentioned in documents such as job postings and resumes. The task is commonly tackled by training supervised models using a sequence labeling approach with BIO tags. However, the reliance on manually annotated data limits the generalizability of such approaches. Moreover, the common BIO setting limits the ability of the models to capture complex skill patterns and handle ambiguous mentions. In this paper, we explore the use of in-context learning to overcome these challenges, on a benchmark of 6 uniformized skill extraction datasets. Our approach leverages the few-shot learning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to identify and extract skills from sentences. We show that LLMs, despite not being on par with traditional supervised models in terms of performance, can better handle syntactically complex skill mentions in skill extraction tasks.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper investigates the language of propaganda and its stylistic features. It presents the PPN dataset, standing for Propagandist Pseudo-News, a multisource, multilingual, multimodal dataset composed of news articles extracted from websites identified as propaganda sources by expert agencies. A limited sample from this set was randomly mixed with papers from the regular French press, and their URL masked, to conduct an annotation-experiment by humans, using 11 distinct labels. The results show that human annotators were able to reliably discriminate between the two types of press across each of the labels. We propose different NLP techniques to identify the cues used by the annotators, and to compare them with machine classification. They include the analyzer VAGO to measure discourse vagueness and subjectivity, a TF-IDF to serve as a baseline, and four different classifiers: two RoBERTa-based models, CATS using syntax, and one XGBoost combining syntactic and semantic features.

**ABSTRACT**  
Massive open online courses (MOOCs) unlock the doors to free education for anyone around the globe with access to a computer and the internet. Despite this democratization of learning, the massive enrollment in these courses means it is almost impossible for one instructor to assess every student's writing assignment. As a result, peer grading, often guided by a straightforward rubric, is the method of choice. While convenient, peer grading often falls short in terms of reliability and validity. In this study, using 18 distinct settings, we explore the feasibility of leveraging large language models (LLMs) to replace peer grading in MOOCs. Specifically, we focus on two state-of-the-art LLMs: GPT-4 and GPT-3.5, across three distinct courses: Introductory Astronomy, Astrobiology, and the History and Philosophy of Astronomy. To instruct LLMs, we use three different prompts based on a variant of the zero-shot chain-of-thought (Zero-shot-CoT) prompting technique: Zero-shot-CoT combined with instructor-provided correct answers; Zero-shot-CoT in conjunction with both instructor-formulated answers and rubrics; and Zero-shot-CoT with instructor-offered correct answers and LLM-generated rubrics. Our results show that Zero-shot-CoT, when integrated with instructor-provided answers and rubrics, produces grades that are more aligned with those assigned by instructors compared to peer grading. However, the History and Philosophy of Astronomy course proves to be more challenging in terms of grading as opposed to other courses. Finally, our study reveals a promising direction for automating grading systems for MOOCs, especially in subjects with well-defined rubrics.

**ABSTRACT**  
Knowledge hallucination have raised widespread concerns for the security and reliability of deployed LLMs. Previous efforts in detecting hallucinations have been employed at logit-level uncertainty estimation or language-level self-consistency evaluation, where the semantic information is inevitably lost during the token-decoding procedure. Thus, we propose to explore the dense semantic information retained within LLMs' \textbf{IN}ternal \textbf{S}tates for halluc\textbf{I}nation \textbf{DE}tection (\textbf{INSIDE}). In particular, a simple yet effective \textbf{EigenScore} metric is proposed to better evaluate responses' self-consistency, which exploits the eigenvalues of responses' covariance matrix to measure the semantic consistency/diversity in the dense embedding space. Furthermore, from the perspective of self-consistent hallucination detection, a test time feature clipping approach is explored to truncate extreme activations in the internal states, which reduces overconfident generations and potentially benefits the detection of overconfident hallucinations. Extensive experiments and ablation studies are performed on several popular LLMs and question-answering (QA) benchmarks, showing the effectiveness of our proposal.

**ABSTRACT**  
The rise of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the way that we interact with artificial intelligence systems through natural language. However, LLMs often misinterpret user queries because of their uncertain intention, leading to less helpful responses. In natural human interactions, clarification is sought through targeted questioning to uncover obscure information. Thus, in this paper, we introduce LaMAI (Language Model with Active Inquiry), designed to endow LLMs with this same level of interactive engagement. LaMAI leverages active learning techniques to raise the most informative questions, fostering a dynamic bidirectional dialogue. This approach not only narrows the contextual gap but also refines the output of the LLMs, aligning it more closely with user expectations. Our empirical studies, across a variety of complex datasets where LLMs have limited conversational context, demonstrate the effectiveness of LaMAI. The method improves answer accuracy from 31.9% to 50.9%, outperforming other leading question-answering frameworks. Moreover, in scenarios involving human participants, LaMAI consistently generates responses that are superior or comparable to baseline methods in more than 82% of the cases. The applicability of LaMAI is further evidenced by its successful integration with various LLMs, highlighting its potential for the future of interactive language models.

**ABSTRACT**  
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is the current dominating framework to fine-tune large language models to better align with human preferences. However, the underlying premise of algorithms developed under this framework can be problematic when user preferences encoded in human feedback are diverse. In this work, we aim to address this problem by developing methods for building personalized language models. We first formally introduce the task of learning from personalized human feedback and explain why vanilla RLHF can be problematic in this context. We then propose a general Personalized-RLHF (P-RLHF) framework, which requires one to jointly learn a user model and a language (or reward) model. The user model takes in user information and outputs user representations. Its structure encodes our assumptions about user preferences underlying the feedback data. We develop new learning objectives for personalized reward modeling and personalized Direct Preference Optimization. To demonstrate the efficacy of our method, we test it on real-world text summarization data with annotated preferences and annotator information. We fine-tune GPT-J 6B to obtain personalized language (and reward) models, which outperform non-personalized models in terms of aligning with individual preferences.

**ABSTRACT**  
Humans make numerous inferences in text comprehension to understand discourse. This paper aims to understand the commonalities and disparities in the inference judgments between humans and state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs). Leveraging a comprehensively curated entailment verification benchmark, we evaluate both human and LLM performance across various reasoning categories. Our benchmark includes datasets from three categories (NLI, contextual QA, and rationales) that include multi-sentence premises and different knowledge types, thereby evaluating the inference capabilities in complex reasoning instances. Notably, our findings reveal LLMs' superiority in multi-hop reasoning across extended contexts, while humans excel in tasks necessitating simple deductive reasoning. Leveraging these insights, we introduce a fine-tuned Flan-T5 model that outperforms GPT-3.5 and rivals with GPT-4, offering a robust open-source solution for entailment verification. As a practical application, we showcase the efficacy of our finetuned model in enhancing self-consistency in model-generated explanations, resulting in a 6% performance boost on average across three multiple-choice question-answering datasets.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recently, increasing attention has been focused drawn on to improve the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform complex reasoning. However, previous methods, such as Chain-of-Thought and Self-Consistency, mainly follow Direct Reasoning (DR) frameworks, so they will meet difficulty in solving numerous real-world tasks which can hardly be solved via DR. Therefore, to strengthen the reasoning power of LLMs, this paper proposes a novel Indirect Reasoning (IR) method that employs the logic of contrapositives and contradictions to tackle IR tasks such as factual reasoning and mathematic proof. Specifically, our methodology comprises two steps. Firstly, we leverage the logical equivalence of contrapositive to augment the data and rules to enhance the comprehensibility of LLMs. Secondly, we design a set of prompt templates to trigger LLMs to conduct IR based on proof by contradiction that is logically equivalent to the original DR process. Our IR method is simple yet effective and can be straightforwardly integrated with existing DR methods to further boost the reasoning abilities of LLMs. The experimental results on popular LLMs, such as GPT-3.5-turbo and Gemini-pro, show that our IR method enhances the overall accuracy of factual reasoning by 27.33% and mathematical proof by 31.43%, when compared with traditional DR methods. Moreover, the methods combining IR and DR significantly outperform the methods solely using IR or DR, further demonstrating the effectiveness of our strategy.

**ABSTRACT**  
Sarcasm Explanation in Dialogue (SED) is a new yet challenging task, which aims to generate a natural language explanation for the given sarcastic dialogue that involves multiple modalities (i.e., utterance, video, and audio). Although existing studies have achieved great success based on the generative pretrained language model BART, they overlook exploiting the sentiments residing in the utterance, video and audio, which are vital clues for sarcasm explanation. In fact, it is non-trivial to incorporate sentiments for boosting SED performance, due to three main challenges: 1) diverse effects of utterance tokens on sentiments; 2) gap between video-audio sentiment signals and the embedding space of BART; and 3) various relations among utterances, utterance sentiments, and video-audio sentiments. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel sEntiment-enhanceD Graph-based multimodal sarcasm Explanation framework, named EDGE. In particular, we first propose a lexicon-guided utterance sentiment inference module, where a heuristic utterance sentiment refinement strategy is devised. We then develop a module named Joint Cross Attention-based Sentiment Inference (JCA-SI) by extending the multimodal sentiment analysis model JCA to derive the joint sentiment label for each video-audio clip. Thereafter, we devise a context-sentiment graph to comprehensively model the semantic relations among the utterances, utterance sentiments, and video-audio sentiments, to facilitate sarcasm explanation generation. Extensive experiments on the publicly released dataset WITS verify the superiority of our model over cutting-edge methods.

**ABSTRACT**  
The Stanceosaurus corpus (Zheng et al., 2022) was designed to provide high-quality, annotated, 5-way stance data extracted from Twitter, suitable for analyzing cross-cultural and cross-lingual misinformation. In the Stanceosaurus 2.0 iteration, we extend this framework to encompass Russian and Spanish. The former is of current significance due to prevalent misinformation amid escalating tensions with the West and the violent incursion into Ukraine. The latter, meanwhile, represents an enormous community that has been largely overlooked on major social media platforms. By incorporating an additional 3,874 Spanish and Russian tweets over 41 misinformation claims, our objective is to support research focused on these issues. To demonstrate the value of this data, we employed zero-shot cross-lingual transfer on multilingual BERT, yielding results on par with the initial Stanceosaurus study with a macro F1 score of 43 for both languages. This underlines the viability of stance classification as an effective tool for identifying multicultural misinformation.

**ABSTRACT**  
The advent of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, PaLM, and GPT-4 has catalyzed remarkable advances in natural language processing, demonstrating human-like language fluency and reasoning capacities. This position paper introduces the concept of Professional Agents (PAgents), an application framework harnessing LLM capabilities to create autonomous agents with controllable, specialized, interactive, and professional-level competencies. We posit that PAgents can reshape professional services through continuously developed expertise. Our proposed PAgents framework entails a tri-layered architecture for genesis, evolution, and synergy: a base tool layer, a middle agent layer, and a top synergy layer. This paper aims to spur discourse on promising real-world applications of LLMs. We argue the increasing sophistication and integration of PAgents could lead to AI systems exhibiting professional mastery over complex domains, serving critical needs, and potentially achieving artificial general intelligence.

**ABSTRACT**  
As Large Language Models make a breakthrough in natural language processing tasks (NLP), multimodal technique becomes extremely popular. However, it has been shown that multimodal NLP are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where the outputs of a model can be dramatically changed by a perturbation to the input. While several defense techniques have been proposed both in computer vision and NLP models, the multimodal robustness of models have not been fully explored. In this paper, we study the adversarial robustness provided by modifying loss function of pre-trained multimodal models, by restricting top K softmax outputs. Based on the evaluation and scoring, our experiments show that after a fine-tuning, adversarial robustness of pre-trained models can be significantly improved, against popular attacks. Further research should be studying, such as output diversity, generalization and the robustness-performance trade-off of this kind of loss functions. Our code will be available after this paper is accepted

**ABSTRACT**  
Large Language Models (LLMs) hold the potential to perform a variety of text processing tasks and provide textual explanations for proposed actions or decisions. In the era of hybrid work, LLMs can provide intelligent decision support for workers who are designing their hybrid work plans. In particular, they can offer suggestions and explanations to workers balancing numerous decision factors, thereby enhancing their work experience. In this paper, we present a decision support model for workspaces in hybrid work environments, leveraging the reasoning skill of LLMs. We first examine LLM's capability of making suitable workspace suggestions. We find that its reasoning extends beyond the guidelines in the prompt and the LLM can manage the trade-off among the available resources in the workspaces. We conduct an extensive user study to understand workers' decision process for workspace choices and evaluate the effectiveness of the system. We observe that a worker's decision could be influenced by the LLM's suggestions and explanations. The participants in our study find the system to be convenient, regardless of whether reasons are provided or not. Our results show that employees can benefit from the LLM-empowered system for their workspace selection in hybrid workplace.

**ABSTRACT**  
Prescription contraceptives play a critical role in supporting women's reproductive health. With nearly 50 million women in the United States using contraceptives, understanding the factors that drive contraceptives selection and switching is of significant interest. However, many factors related to medication switching are often only captured in unstructured clinical notes and can be difficult to extract. Here, we evaluate the zero-shot abilities of a recently developed large language model, GPT-4 (via HIPAA-compliant Microsoft Azure API), to identify reasons for switching between classes of contraceptives from the UCSF Information Commons clinical notes dataset. We demonstrate that GPT-4 can accurately extract reasons for contraceptive switching, outperforming baseline BERT-based models with microF1 scores of 0.849 and 0.881 for contraceptive start and stop extraction, respectively. Human evaluation of GPT-4-extracted reasons for switching showed 91.4% accuracy, with minimal hallucinations. Using extracted reasons, we identified patient preference, adverse events, and insurance as key reasons for switching using unsupervised topic modeling approaches. Notably, we also showed using our approach that "weight gain/mood change" and "insurance coverage" are disproportionately found as reasons for contraceptive switching in specific demographic populations. Our code and supplemental data are available at https://github.com/BMiao10/contraceptive-switching.

**ABSTRACT**  
Advances in AI invite misuse of language models as replacements for human participants. We argue that treating their responses as glimpses into an average human mind fundamentally mischaracterizes these statistical algorithms and that language models should be embraced as flexible simulation tools, able to mimic diverse behaviors without possessing human traits themselves.

**ABSTRACT**  
We live in the era of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI). Deepfakes and Large Language Models (LLMs) are two examples of GenAI. Deepfakes, in particular, pose an alarming threat to society as they are capable of spreading misinformation and changing the truth. LLMs are powerful language models that generate general-purpose language. However due to its generative aspect, it can also be a risk for people if used with ill intentions. The ethical use of these technologies is a big concern. This short article tries to find out the interrelationship between them.

**ABSTRACT**  
Large language models (LLMs) can pass explicit bias tests but still harbor implicit biases, similar to humans who endorse egalitarian beliefs yet exhibit subtle biases. Measuring such implicit biases can be a challenge: as LLMs become increasingly proprietary, it may not be possible to access their embeddings and apply existing bias measures; furthermore, implicit biases are primarily a concern if they affect the actual decisions that these systems make. We address both of these challenges by introducing two measures of bias inspired by psychology: LLM Implicit Association Test (IAT) Bias, which is a prompt-based method for revealing implicit bias; and LLM Decision Bias for detecting subtle discrimination in decision-making tasks. Using these measures, we found pervasive human-like stereotype biases in 6 LLMs across 4 social domains (race, gender, religion, health) and 21 categories (weapons, guilt, science, career among others). Our prompt-based measure of implicit bias correlates with embedding-based methods but better predicts downstream behaviors measured by LLM Decision Bias. This measure is based on asking the LLM to decide between individuals, motivated by psychological results indicating that relative not absolute evaluations are more related to implicit biases. Using prompt-based measures informed by psychology allows us to effectively expose nuanced biases and subtle discrimination in proprietary LLMs that do not show explicit bias on standard benchmarks.

**ABSTRACT**  
The introduction of AI and ML technologies into medical devices has revolutionized healthcare diagnostics and treatments. Medical device manufacturers are keen to maximize the advantages afforded by AI and ML by consolidating multiple applications onto a single platform. However, concurrent execution of several AI applications, each with its own visualization components, leads to unpredictable end-to-end latency, primarily due to GPU resource contentions. To mitigate this, manufacturers typically deploy separate workstations for distinct AI applications, thereby increasing financial, energy, and maintenance costs. This paper addresses these challenges within the context of NVIDIA's Holoscan platform, a real-time AI system for streaming sensor data and images. We propose a system design optimized for heterogeneous GPU workloads, encompassing both compute and graphics tasks. Our design leverages CUDA MPS for spatial partitioning of compute workloads and isolates compute and graphics processing onto separate GPUs. We demonstrate significant performance improvements across various end-to-end latency determinism metrics through empirical evaluation with real-world Holoscan medical device applications. For instance, the proposed design reduces maximum latency by 21-30% and improves latency distribution flatness by 17-25% for up to five concurrent endoscopy tool tracking AI applications, compared to a single-GPU baseline. Against a default multi-GPU setup, our optimizations decrease maximum latency by 35% for up to six concurrent applications by improving GPU utilization by 42%. This paper provides clear design insights for AI applications in the edge-computing domain including medical systems, where performance predictability of concurrent and heterogeneous GPU workloads is a critical requirement.

**ABSTRACT**  
Pre-trained Code Language Models (Code-PLMs) have shown many advancements and achieved state-of-the-art results for many software engineering tasks in the past few years. These models are mainly targeted for popular programming languages such as Java and Python, leaving out many other ones like R. Though R has a wide community of developers and users, there is little known about the applicability of Code-PLMs for R. In this preliminary study, we aim to investigate the vulnerability of Code-PLMs for code entities in R. For this purpose, we use an R dataset of code and comment pairs and then apply CodeAttack, a black-box attack model that uses the structure of code to generate adversarial code samples. We investigate how the model can attack different entities in R. This is the first step towards understanding the importance of R token types, compared to popular programming languages (e.g., Java). We limit our study to code summarization. Our results show that the most vulnerable code entity is the identifier, followed by some syntax tokens specific to R. The results can shed light on the importance of token types and help in developing models for code summarization and method name prediction for the R language.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this paper we address the following question: How can we use Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve code independently of a human, while ensuring that the improved code   - does not regress the properties of the original code?   - improves the original in a verifiable and measurable way?   To address this question, we advocate Assured LLM-Based Software Engineering; a generate-and-test approach, inspired by Genetic Improvement. Assured LLMSE applies a series of semantic filters that discard code that fails to meet these twin guarantees. This overcomes the potential problem of LLM's propensity to hallucinate. It allows us to generate code using LLMs, independently of any human. The human plays the role only of final code reviewer, as they would do with code generated by other human engineers.   This paper is an outline of the content of the keynote by Mark Harman at the International Workshop on Interpretability, Robustness, and Benchmarking in Neural Software Engineering, Monday 15th April 2024, Lisbon, Portugal.

**ABSTRACT**  
CodeCompose is an AI-assisted code authoring tool powered by large language models (LLMs) that provides inline suggestions to 10's of thousands of developers at Meta. In this paper, we present how we scaled the product from displaying single-line suggestions to multi-line suggestions. This evolution required us to overcome several unique challenges in improving the usability of these suggestions for developers.   First, we discuss how multi-line suggestions can have a 'jarring' effect, as the LLM's suggestions constantly move around the developer's existing code, which would otherwise result in decreased productivity and satisfaction.   Second, multi-line suggestions take significantly longer to generate; hence we present several innovative investments we made to reduce the perceived latency for users. These model-hosting optimizations sped up multi-line suggestion latency by 2.5x.   Finally, we conduct experiments on 10's of thousands of engineers to understand how multi-line suggestions impact the user experience and contrast this with single-line suggestions. Our experiments reveal that (i) multi-line suggestions account for 42% of total characters accepted (despite only accounting for 16% for displayed suggestions) (ii) multi-line suggestions almost doubled the percentage of keystrokes saved for users from 9% to 17%. Multi-line CodeCompose has been rolled out to all engineers at Meta, and less than 1% of engineers have opted out of multi-line suggestions.

Patch descriptions provide detailed accounts of changes, aiding comprehension and collaboration among developers. However, manual description creation poses challenges in terms of time consumption and variations in quality and detail. In this paper, we propose PATCHEXPLAINER, an approach that addresses these challenges by framing patch description generation as a machine translation task. In PATCHEXPLAINER, we leverage explicit representations of critical elements, historical context, and syntactic conventions. Moreover, the translation model in PATCHEXPLAINER is designed with an awareness of description similarity. Particularly, the model is explicitly trained to recognize and incorporate similarities present in patch descriptions clustered into groups, improving its ability to generate accurate and consistent descriptions across similar patches. The dual objectives maximize similarity and accurately predict affiliating groups. Our experimental results on a large dataset of real-world software patches show that PATCHEXPLAINER consistently outperforms existing methods, with improvements up to 189% in BLEU, 5.7X in Exact Match rate, and 154% in Semantic Similarity, affirming its effectiveness in generating software patch descriptions.

**ABSTRACT**  
With the exponential growth of AI tools that generate source code, understanding software has become crucial. When developers comprehend a program, they may refer to additional contexts to look for information, e.g. program documentation or historical code versions. Therefore, we argue that encoding this additional contextual information could also benefit code representation for deep learning. Recent papers incorporate contextual data (e.g. call hierarchy) into vector representation to address program comprehension problems. This motivates further studies to explore additional contexts, such as version history, to enhance models' understanding of programs. That is, insights from version history enable recognition of patterns in code evolution over time, recurring issues, and the effectiveness of past solutions. Our paper presents preliminary evidence of the potential benefit of encoding contextual information from the version history to predict code clones and perform code classification. We experiment with two representative deep learning models, ASTNN and CodeBERT, to investigate whether combining additional contexts with different aggregations may benefit downstream activities. The experimental result affirms the positive impact of combining version history into source code representation in all scenarios; however, to ensure the technique performs consistently, we need to conduct a holistic investigation on a larger code base using different combinations of contexts, aggregation, and models. Therefore, we propose a research agenda aimed at exploring various aspects of encoding additional context to improve code representation and its optimal utilisation in specific situations.

**ABSTRACT**  
Issue tracking systems serve as the primary tool for incorporating external users and customizing a software project to meet the users' requirements. However, the limited number of contributors and the challenge of identifying the best approach for each issue often impede effective resolution. Recently, an increasing number of developers are turning to AI tools like ChatGPT to enhance problem-solving efficiency. While previous studies have demonstrated the potential of ChatGPT in areas such as automatic program repair, debugging, and code generation, there is a lack of study on how developers explicitly utilize ChatGPT to resolve issues in their tracking system. Hence, this study aims to examine the interaction between ChatGPT and developers to analyze their prevalent activities and provide a resolution. In addition, we assess the code reliability by confirming if the code produced by ChatGPT was integrated into the project's codebase using the clone detection tool NiCad. Our investigation reveals that developers mainly use ChatGPT for brainstorming solutions but often opt to write their code instead of using ChatGPT-generated code, possibly due to concerns over the generation of "hallucinated code", as highlighted in the literature.

**ABSTRACT**  
Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in code completion, as evidenced by their essential roles in developing code assistant services such as Copilot. Being trained on in-file contexts, current LLMs are quite effective in completing code for single source files. However, it is challenging for them to conduct repository-level code completion for large software projects that require cross-file information. Existing research on LLM-based repository-level code completion identifies and integrates cross-file contexts, but it suffers from low accuracy and limited context length of LLMs. In this paper, we argue that Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) can provide direct, accurate and real-time cross-file information for repository-level code completion. We propose IDECoder, a practical framework that leverages IDE native static contexts for cross-context construction and diagnosis results for self-refinement. IDECoder utilizes the rich cross-context information available in IDEs to enhance the capabilities of LLMs of repository-level code completion. We conducted preliminary experiments to validate the performance of IDECoder and observed that this synergy represents a promising trend for future exploration.

**ABSTRACT**  
The paper introduces SceMQA, a novel benchmark for scientific multimodal question answering at the college entrance level. It addresses a critical educational phase often overlooked in existing benchmarks, spanning high school to pre-college levels. SceMQA focuses on core science subjects including Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. It features a blend of multiple-choice and free-response formats, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of AI models' abilities. Additionally, our benchmark provides specific knowledge points for each problem and detailed explanations for each answer. SceMQA also uniquely presents problems with identical contexts but varied questions to facilitate a more thorough and accurate assessment of reasoning capabilities. In the experiment, we evaluate both open-source and close-source state-of-the-art Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), across various experimental settings. The results show that further research and development are needed in developing more capable MLLM, as highlighted by only 50% to 60% accuracy achieved by the strongest models. Our benchmark and analysis will be available at https://scemqa.github.io/

**ABSTRACT**  
Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated a number of human-like abilities, however the empathic understanding and emotional state of LLMs is yet to be aligned to that of humans. In this work, we investigate how the emotional state of generative LLM agents evolves as they perceive new events, introducing a novel architecture in which new experiences are compared to past memories. Through this comparison, the agent gains the ability to understand new experiences in context, which according to the appraisal theory of emotion is vital in emotion creation. First, the agent perceives new experiences as time series text data. After perceiving each new input, the agent generates a summary of past relevant memories, referred to as the norm, and compares the new experience to this norm. Through this comparison we can analyse how the agent reacts to the new experience in context. The PANAS, a test of affect, is administered to the agent, capturing the emotional state of the agent after the perception of the new event. Finally, the new experience is then added to the agents memory to be used in the creation of future norms. By creating multiple experiences in natural language from emotionally charged situations, we test the proposed architecture on a wide range of scenarios. The mixed results suggests that introducing context can occasionally improve the emotional alignment of the agent, but further study and comparison with human evaluators is necessary. We hope that this paper is another step towards the alignment of generative agents.

**ABSTRACT**  
Large-scale generative models are shown to be useful for sampling meaningful candidate solutions, yet they often overlook task constraints and user preferences. Their full power is better harnessed when the models are coupled with external verifiers and the final solutions are derived iteratively or progressively according to the verification feedback. In the context of embodied AI, verification often solely involves assessing whether goal conditions specified in the instructions have been met. Nonetheless, for these agents to be seamlessly integrated into daily life, it is crucial to account for a broader range of constraints and preferences beyond bare task success (e.g., a robot should grasp bread with care to avoid significant deformations). However, given the unbounded scope of robot tasks, it is infeasible to construct scripted verifiers akin to those used for explicit-knowledge tasks like the game of Go and theorem proving. This begs the question: when no sound verifier is available, can we use large vision and language models (VLMs), which are approximately omniscient, as scalable Behavior Critics to catch undesirable robot behaviors in videos? To answer this, we first construct a benchmark that contains diverse cases of goal-reaching yet undesirable robot policies. Then, we comprehensively evaluate VLM critics to gain a deeper understanding of their strengths and failure modes. Based on the evaluation, we provide guidelines on how to effectively utilize VLM critiques and showcase a practical way to integrate the feedback into an iterative process of policy refinement. The dataset and codebase are released at: https://guansuns.github.io/pages/vlm-critic.

**ABSTRACT**  
Humans possess a remarkable capacity to recognize and manipulate abstract structure, which is especially apparent in the domain of geometry. Recent research in cognitive science suggests neural networks do not share this capacity, concluding that human geometric abilities come from discrete symbolic structure in human mental representations. However, progress in artificial intelligence (AI) suggests that neural networks begin to demonstrate more human-like reasoning after scaling up standard architectures in both model size and amount of training data. In this study, we revisit empirical results in cognitive science on geometric visual processing and identify three key biases in geometric visual processing: a sensitivity towards complexity, regularity, and the perception of parts and relations. We test tasks from the literature that probe these biases in humans and find that large pre-trained neural network models used in AI demonstrate more human-like abstract geometric processing.

**ABSTRACT**  
Developing a generalist agent is a longstanding objective in artificial intelligence. Previous efforts utilizing extensive offline datasets from various tasks demonstrate remarkable performance in multitasking scenarios within Reinforcement Learning. However, these works encounter challenges in extending their capabilities to new tasks. Recent approaches integrate textual guidance or visual trajectory into decision networks to provide task-specific contextual cues, representing a promising direction. However, it is observed that relying solely on textual guidance or visual trajectory is insufficient for accurately conveying the contextual information of tasks. This paper explores enhanced forms of task guidance for agents, enabling them to comprehend gameplay instructions, thereby facilitating a "read-to-play" capability. Drawing inspiration from the success of multimodal instruction tuning in visual tasks, we treat the visual-based RL task as a long-horizon vision task and construct a set of multimodal game instructions to incorporate instruction tuning into a decision transformer. Experimental results demonstrate that incorporating multimodal game instructions significantly enhances the decision transformer's multitasking and generalization capabilities.

**ABSTRACT**  
This study consists of a novel approach toward the analysis of court judgments spanning five countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Rwanda, Sweden and Hong Kong. This study also explores the intersection of the latest advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and legal analysis, emphasizing the role of AI (specifically generative AI) in identifying human biases and facilitating automated, valid, and coherent multisided argumentation of court judgments with the goal of ensuring consistent application of laws in and across various jurisdictions. By incorporating Advanced Language Models (ALMs) and a newly introduced human-AI collaborative framework, this paper seeks to analyze Grounded Theory-based research design with Advanced Language Models (ALMs) in the practice of law. SHIRLEY is the name of the AI-based application (built on top of OpenAI's GPT technology), focusing on detecting logical inconsistencies and biases across various legal decisions. SHIRLEY analysis is aggregated and is accompanied by a comparison-oriented AI-based application called SAM (also an ALM) to identify relative deviations in SHIRLEY bias detections. Further, a CRITIC is generated within semi-autonomous arbitration process via the ALM, SARA. A novel approach is introduced in the utilization of an AI arbitrator to critically evaluate biases and qualitative-in-nature nuances identified by the aforementioned AI applications (SAM in concert with SHIRLEY), based on the Hague Rules on Business and Human Rights Arbitration. This Semi-Automated Arbitration Process (SAAP) aims to uphold the integrity and fairness of legal judgments by ensuring a nuanced debate-resultant "understanding" through a hybrid system of AI and human-based collaborative analysis.

**ABSTRACT**  
Humans have a tendency to see 'human'-like qualities in objects around them. We name our cars, and talk to pets and even household appliances, as if they could understand us as other humans do. This behavior, called anthropomorphism, is also seeing traction in Machine Learning (ML), where human-like intelligence is claimed to be perceived in Large Language Models (LLMs). In this position paper, considering professional incentives, human biases, and general methodological setups, we discuss how the current search for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is a perfect storm for over-attributing human-like qualities to LLMs. In several experiments, we demonstrate that the discovery of human-interpretable patterns in latent spaces should not be a surprising outcome. Also in consideration of common AI portrayal in the media, we call for the academic community to exercise extra caution, and to be extra aware of principles of academic integrity, in interpreting and communicating about AI research outcomes.

**ABSTRACT**  
Node Importance Estimation (NIE) is crucial for integrating external information into Large Language Models through Retriever-Augmented Generation. Traditional methods, focusing on static, single-graph characteristics, lack adaptability to new graphs and user-specific requirements. CADReN, our proposed method, addresses these limitations by introducing a Contextual Anchor (CA) mechanism. This approach enables the network to assess node importance relative to the CA, considering both structural and semantic features within Knowledge Graphs (KGs). Extensive experiments show that CADReN achieves better performance in cross-graph NIE task, with zero-shot prediction ability. CADReN is also proven to match the performance of previous models on single-graph NIE task. Additionally, we introduce and opensource two new datasets, RIC200 and WK1K, specifically designed for cross-graph NIE research, providing a valuable resource for future developments in this domain.

**ABSTRACT**  
Clifford algebras are a natural generalization of the real numbers, the complex numbers, and the quaternions. So far, solely Clifford algebras of the form $Cl_{p,q}$ (i.e., algebras without nilpotent base vectors) have been studied in the context of knowledge graph embeddings. We propose to consider nilpotent base vectors with a nilpotency index of two. In these spaces, denoted $Cl_{p,q,r}$, allows generalizing over approaches based on dual numbers (which cannot be modelled using $Cl_{p,q}$) and capturing patterns that emanate from the absence of higher-order interactions between real and complex parts of entity embeddings. We design two new models for the discovery of the parameters $p$, $q$, and $r$. The first model uses a greedy search to optimize $p$, $q$, and $r$. The second predicts $(p, q,r)$ based on an embedding of the input knowledge graph computed using neural networks. The results of our evaluation on seven benchmark datasets suggest that nilpotent vectors can help capture embeddings better. Our comparison against the state of the art suggests that our approach generalizes better than other approaches on all datasets w.r.t. the MRR it achieves on validation data. We also show that a greedy search suffices to discover values of $p$, $q$ and $r$ that are close to optimal.

**ABSTRACT**  
We propose Embodied AI as the next fundamental step in the pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence, juxtaposing it against current AI advancements, particularly Large Language Models. We traverse the evolution of the embodiment concept across diverse fields - philosophy, psychology, neuroscience, and robotics - to highlight how EAI distinguishes itself from the classical paradigm of static learning. By broadening the scope of Embodied AI, we introduce a theoretical framework based on cognitive architectures, emphasizing perception, action, memory, and learning as essential components of an embodied agent. This framework is aligned with Friston's active inference principle, offering a comprehensive approach to EAI development. Despite the progress made in the field of AI, substantial challenges, such as the formulation of a novel AI learning theory and the innovation of advanced hardware, persist. Our discussion lays down a foundational guideline for future Embodied AI research. Highlighting the importance of creating Embodied AI agents capable of seamless communication, collaboration, and coexistence with humans and other intelligent entities within real-world environments, we aim to steer the AI community towards addressing the multifaceted challenges and seizing the opportunities that lie ahead in the quest for AGI.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper presents RevOrder, a novel technique aimed at improving arithmetic operations in large language models (LLMs) by reversing the output digits in addition, subtraction, and n-digit by 1-digit (nD by 1D) multiplication tasks. Our method significantly reduces the Count of Sequential Intermediate Digits (CSID) to $\mathcal{O}(1)$, a new metric we introduce to assess equation complexity. Through comprehensive testing, RevOrder not only achieves perfect accuracy in basic arithmetic operations but also substantially boosts LLM performance in division tasks, particularly with large numbers where traditional models struggle. Implementation of RevOrder is cost-effective for both training and inference phases. Moreover, applying RevOrder to fine-tune the LLaMA2-7B model on the GSM8K math task results in a considerable improvement, reducing equation calculation errors by 46% and increasing overall scores from 41.6 to 44.4.

**ABSTRACT**  
Autonomous agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) that devise plans and tackle real-world challenges have gained prominence.However, tailoring these agents for specialized domains like quantitative investment remains a formidable task. The core challenge involves efficiently building and integrating a domain-specific knowledge base for the agent's learning process. This paper introduces a principled framework to address this challenge, comprising a two-layer loop.In the inner loop, the agent refines its responses by drawing from its knowledge base, while in the outer loop, these responses are tested in real-world scenarios to automatically enhance the knowledge base with new insights.We demonstrate that our approach enables the agent to progressively approximate optimal behavior with provable efficiency.Furthermore, we instantiate this framework through an autonomous agent for mining trading signals named QuantAgent. Empirical results showcase QuantAgent's capability in uncovering viable financial signals and enhancing the accuracy of financial forecasts.

**ABSTRACT**  
Knowledge graphs (KGs) have garnered significant attention for their vast potential across diverse domains. However, the issue of outdated facts poses a challenge to KGs, affecting their overall quality as real-world information evolves. Existing solutions for outdated fact detection often rely on manual recognition. In response, this paper presents DEAN (Deep outdatEd fAct detectioN), a novel deep learning-based framework designed to identify outdated facts within KGs. DEAN distinguishes itself by capturing implicit structural information among facts through comprehensive modeling of both entities and relations. To effectively uncover latent out-of-date information, DEAN employs a contrastive approach based on a pre-defined Relations-to-Nodes (R2N) graph, weighted by the number of entities. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of DEAN over state-of-the-art baseline methods.

**ABSTRACT**  
Reinforcement Learning (RL) has made significant strides in enabling artificial agents to learn diverse behaviors. However, learning an effective policy often requires a large number of environment interactions. To mitigate sample complexity issues, recent approaches have used high-level task specifications, such as Linear Temporal Logic (LTL$_f$) formulas or Reward Machines (RM), to guide the learning progress of the agent. In this work, we propose a novel approach, called Logical Specifications-guided Dynamic Task Sampling (LSTS), that learns a set of RL policies to guide an agent from an initial state to a goal state based on a high-level task specification, while minimizing the number of environmental interactions. Unlike previous work, LSTS does not assume information about the environment dynamics or the Reward Machine, and dynamically samples promising tasks that lead to successful goal policies. We evaluate LSTS on a gridworld and show that it achieves improved time-to-threshold performance on complex sequential decision-making problems compared to state-of-the-art RM and Automaton-guided RL baselines, such as Q-Learning for Reward Machines and Compositional RL from logical Specifications (DIRL). Moreover, we demonstrate that our method outperforms RM and Automaton-guided RL baselines in terms of sample-efficiency, both in a partially observable robotic task and in a continuous control robotic manipulation task.

**ABSTRACT**  
We introduce SELF-DISCOVER, a general framework for LLMs to self-discover the task-intrinsic reasoning structures to tackle complex reasoning problems that are challenging for typical prompting methods. Core to the framework is a self-discovery process where LLMs select multiple atomic reasoning modules such as critical thinking and step-by-step thinking, and compose them into an explicit reasoning structure for LLMs to follow during decoding. SELF-DISCOVER substantially improves GPT-4 and PaLM 2's performance on challenging reasoning benchmarks such as BigBench-Hard, grounded agent reasoning, and MATH, by as much as 32% compared to Chain of Thought (CoT). Furthermore, SELF-DISCOVER outperforms inference-intensive methods such as CoT-Self-Consistency by more than 20%, while requiring 10-40x fewer inference compute. Finally, we show that the self-discovered reasoning structures are universally applicable across model families: from PaLM 2-L to GPT-4, and from GPT-4 to Llama2, and share commonalities with human reasoning patterns.

**ABSTRACT**  
Humans extract useful abstractions of the world from noisy sensory data. Serial reproduction allows us to study how people construe the world through a paradigm similar to the game of telephone, where one person observes a stimulus and reproduces it for the next to form a chain of reproductions. Past serial reproduction experiments typically employ a single sensory modality, but humans often communicate abstractions of the world to each other through language. To investigate the effect language on the formation of abstractions, we implement a novel multimodal serial reproduction framework by asking people who receive a visual stimulus to reproduce it in a linguistic format, and vice versa. We ran unimodal and multimodal chains with both humans and GPT-4 and find that adding language as a modality has a larger effect on human reproductions than GPT-4's. This suggests human visual and linguistic representations are more dissociable than those of GPT-4.

**ABSTRACT**  
The prevalence of smart devices with the ability to capture moments in multiple modalities has enabled users to experience multimodal information online. However, large Language (LLMs) and Vision models (LVMs) are still limited in capturing holistic meaning with cross-modal semantic relationships. Without explicit, common sense knowledge (e.g., as a knowledge graph), Visual Language Models (VLMs) only learn implicit representations by capturing high-level patterns in vast corpora, missing essential contextual cross-modal cues. In this work, we design a framework to couple explicit commonsense knowledge in the form of knowledge graphs with large VLMs to improve the performance of a downstream task, predicting the effectiveness of multi-modal marketing campaigns. While the marketing application provides a compelling metric for assessing our methods, our approach enables the early detection of likely persuasive multi-modal campaigns and the assessment and augmentation of marketing theory.

**ABSTRACT**  
The advent of communication technologies marks a transformative phase in critical infrastructure construction, where the meticulous analysis of failures becomes paramount in achieving the fundamental objectives of continuity, security, and availability. This survey enriches the discourse on failures, failure analysis, and countermeasures in the context of the next-generation critical communication infrastructures. Through an exhaustive examination of existing literature, we discern and categorize prominent research orientations with focuses on, namely resource depletion, security vulnerabilities, and system availability concerns. We also analyze constructive countermeasures tailored to address identified failure scenarios and their prevention. Furthermore, the survey emphasizes the imperative for standardization in addressing failures related to Artificial Intelligence (AI) within the ambit of the sixth-generation (6G) networks, accounting for the forward-looking perspective for the envisioned intelligence of 6G network architecture. By identifying new challenges and delineating future research directions, this survey can help guide stakeholders toward unexplored territories, fostering innovation and resilience in critical communication infrastructure development and failure prevention.

**ABSTRACT**  
Pretraining on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has shown great power in facilitating various downstream tasks. As pretraining generally requires huge amount of data and computational resources, the pretrained GNNs are high-value Intellectual Properties (IP) of the legitimate owner. However, adversaries may illegally copy and deploy the pretrained GNN models for their downstream tasks. Though initial efforts have been made to watermark GNN classifiers for IP protection, these methods require the target classification task for watermarking, and thus are not applicable to self-supervised pretraining of GNN models. Hence, in this work, we propose a novel framework named PreGIP to watermark the pretraining of GNN encoder for IP protection while maintain the high-quality of the embedding space. PreGIP incorporates a task-free watermarking loss to watermark the embedding space of pretrained GNN encoder. A finetuning-resistant watermark injection is further deployed. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments show the effectiveness of {\method} in IP protection and maintaining high-performance for downstream tasks.

**ABSTRACT**  
Synthetic Electronic Health Records (EHR) have emerged as a pivotal tool in advancing healthcare applications and machine learning models, particularly for researchers without direct access to healthcare data. Although existing methods, like rule-based approaches and generative adversarial networks (GANs), generate synthetic data that resembles real-world EHR data, these methods often use a tabular format, disregarding temporal dependencies in patient histories and limiting data replication. Recently, there has been a growing interest in leveraging Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT) for EHR data. This enables applications like disease progression analysis, population estimation, counterfactual reasoning, and synthetic data generation. In this work, we focus on synthetic data generation and demonstrate the capability of training a GPT model using a particular patient representation derived from CEHR-BERT, enabling us to generate patient sequences that can be seamlessly converted to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) data format.

**ABSTRACT**  
Many sequential classification tasks are affected by label noise that varies over time. Such noise can cause label quality to improve, worsen, or periodically change over time. We first propose and formalize temporal label noise, an unstudied problem for sequential classification of time series. In this setting, multiple labels are recorded in sequence while being corrupted by a time-dependent noise function. We first demonstrate the importance of modelling the temporal nature of the label noise function and how existing methods will consistently underperform. We then propose methods that can train noise-tolerant classifiers by estimating the temporal label noise function directly from data. We show that our methods lead to state-of-the-art performance in the presence of diverse temporal label noise functions using real and synthetic data.

**ABSTRACT**  
Post-training quantization (PTQ) reduces the memory footprint of LLMs by quantizing their weights to low-precision. In this work, we introduce QuIP#, a weight-only PTQ method that achieves state-of-the-art results in extreme compression regimes ($\le$ 4 bits per weight) using three novel techniques. First, QuIP# improves the incoherence processing from QuIP by using the randomized Hadamard transform, which is faster and has better theoretical properties. Second, QuIP# uses vector quantization techniques to take advantage of the ball-shaped sub-Gaussian distribution that incoherent weights possess: specifically, we introduce a set of hardware-efficient codebooks based on the highly symmetric $E_8$ lattice, which achieves the optimal 8-dimension unit ball packing. Third, QuIP# uses fine-tuning to improve fidelity to the original model. Our experiments show that QuIP# outperforms existing PTQ methods, enables new behaviors in PTQ scaling, and supports fast inference.

**ABSTRACT**  
We propose fine-tuning large language models for generation of stable materials. While unorthodox, fine-tuning large language models on text-encoded atomistic data is simple to implement yet reliable, with around 90% of sampled structures obeying physical constraints on atom positions and charges. Using energy above hull calculations from both learned ML potentials and gold-standard DFT calculations, we show that our strongest model (fine-tuned LLaMA-2 70B) can generate materials predicted to be metastable at about twice the rate (49% vs 28%) of CDVAE, a competing diffusion model. Because of text prompting's inherent flexibility, our models can simultaneously be used for unconditional generation of stable material, infilling of partial structures and text-conditional generation. Finally, we show that language models' ability to capture key symmetries of crystal structures improves with model scale, suggesting that the biases of pretrained LLMs are surprisingly well-suited for atomistic data.

**ABSTRACT**  
Resilience against stragglers is a critical element of prediction serving systems, tasked with executing inferences on input data for a pre-trained machine-learning model. In this paper, we propose NeRCC, as a general straggler-resistant framework for approximate coded computing. NeRCC includes three layers: (1) encoding regression and sampling, which generates coded data points, as a combination of original data points, (2) computing, in which a cluster of workers run inference on the coded data points, (3) decoding regression and sampling, which approximately recovers the predictions of the original data points from the available predictions on the coded data points. We argue that the overall objective of the framework reveals an underlying interconnection between two regression models in the encoding and decoding layers. We propose a solution to the nested regressions problem by summarizing their dependence on two regularization terms that are jointly optimized. Our extensive experiments on different datasets and various machine learning models, including LeNet5, RepVGG, and Vision Transformer (ViT), demonstrate that NeRCC accurately approximates the original predictions in a wide range of stragglers, outperforming the state-of-the-art by up to 23%.

**ABSTRACT**  
Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in understanding and generating natural language. However, their capabilities wane in highly specialized domains underrepresented in the pretraining corpus, such as physical and biomedical sciences. This work explores how to repurpose general LLMs into effective task solvers for specialized domains. We introduce a novel, model-agnostic framework for learning custom input tags, which are parameterized as continuous vectors appended to the LLM's embedding layer, to condition the LLM. We design two types of input tags: domain tags are used to delimit specialized representations (e.g., chemical formulas) and provide domain-relevant context; function tags are used to represent specific functions (e.g., predicting molecular properties) and compress function-solving instructions. We develop a three-stage protocol to learn these tags using auxiliary data and domain knowledge. By explicitly disentangling task domains from task functions, our method enables zero-shot generalization to unseen problems through diverse combinations of the input tags. It also boosts LLM's performance in various specialized domains, such as predicting protein or chemical properties and modeling drug-target interactions, outperforming expert models tailored to these tasks.

**ABSTRACT**  
The distributional simplicity bias (DSB) posits that neural networks learn low-order moments of the data distribution first, before moving on to higher-order correlations. In this work, we present compelling new evidence for the DSB by showing that networks automatically learn to perform well on maximum-entropy distributions whose low-order statistics match those of the training set early in training, then lose this ability later. We also extend the DSB to discrete domains by proving an equivalence between token $n$-gram frequencies and the moments of embedding vectors, and by finding empirical evidence for the bias in LLMs. Finally we use optimal transport methods to surgically edit the low-order statistics of one class to match those of another, and show that early-training networks treat the edited samples as if they were drawn from the target class.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper introduces the first theoretical framework for quantifying the efficiency and performance gain opportunity size of adaptive inference algorithms. We provide new approximate and exact bounds for the achievable efficiency and performance gains, supported by empirical evidence demonstrating the potential for 10-100x efficiency improvements in both Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing tasks without incurring any performance penalties. Additionally, we offer insights on improving achievable efficiency gains through the optimal selection and design of adaptive inference state spaces.

**ABSTRACT**  
Linear attentions have shown potential for improving Transformer efficiency, reducing attention's quadratic complexity to linear in sequence length. This holds exciting promise for (1) training linear Transformers from scratch, (2) "finetuned-conversion" of task-specific Transformers into linear versions that recover task performance, and (3) "pretrained-conversion" of Transformers such as large language models into linear versions finetunable on downstream tasks. However, linear attentions often underperform standard softmax attention in quality. To close this performance gap, we find prior linear attentions lack key properties of softmax attention tied to good performance: low-entropy (or "spiky") weights and dot-product monotonicity. We further observe surprisingly simple feature maps that retain these properties and match softmax performance, but are inefficient to compute in linear attention. We thus propose Hedgehog, a learnable linear attention that retains the spiky and monotonic properties of softmax attention while maintaining linear complexity. Hedgehog uses simple trainable MLPs to produce attention weights mimicking softmax attention. Experiments show Hedgehog recovers over 99% of standard Transformer quality in train-from-scratch and finetuned-conversion settings, outperforming prior linear attentions up to 6 perplexity points on WikiText-103 with causal GPTs, and up to 8.7 GLUE score points on finetuned bidirectional BERTs. Hedgehog also enables pretrained-conversion. Converting a pretrained GPT-2 into a linear attention variant achieves state-of-the-art 16.7 perplexity on WikiText-103 for 125M subquadratic decoder models. We finally turn a pretrained Llama-2 7B into a viable linear attention Llama. With low-rank adaptation, Hedgehog-Llama2 7B achieves 28.1 higher ROUGE-1 points over the base standard attention model, where prior linear attentions lead to 16.5 point drops.

**ABSTRACT**  
State-space models (SSMs), such as Mamba Gu & Dao (2034), have been proposed as alternatives to Transformer networks in language modeling, by incorporating gating, convolutions, and input-dependent token selection to mitigate the quadratic cost of multi-head attention. Although SSMs exhibit competitive performance, their in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, a remarkable emergent property of modern language models that enables task execution without parameter optimization, remain underexplored compared to Transformers. In this study, we evaluate the ICL performance of SSMs, focusing on Mamba, against Transformer models across various tasks. Our results show that SSMs perform comparably to Transformers in standard regression ICL tasks, while outperforming them in tasks like sparse parity learning. However, SSMs fall short in tasks involving non-standard retrieval functionality. To address these limitations, we introduce a hybrid model, \variant, that combines Mamba with attention blocks, surpassing individual models in tasks where they struggle independently. Our findings suggest that hybrid architectures offer promising avenues for enhancing ICL in language models.

**ABSTRACT**  
The Transformer architecture has shown to be a powerful tool for a wide range of tasks. It is based on the self-attention mechanism, which is an inherently computationally expensive operation with quadratic computational complexity: memory usage and compute time increase quadratically with the length of the input sequences, thus limiting the application of Transformers. In this work, we propose a novel Clustering self-Attention mechanism using Surrogate Tokens (CAST), to optimize the attention computation and achieve efficient transformers. CAST utilizes learnable surrogate tokens to construct a cluster affinity matrix, used to cluster the input sequence and generate novel cluster summaries. The self-attention from within each cluster is then combined with the cluster summaries of other clusters, enabling information flow across the entire input sequence. CAST improves efficiency by reducing the complexity from $O(N^2)$ to $O(\alpha N)$ where N is the sequence length, and {\alpha} is constant according to the number of clusters and samples per cluster. We show that CAST performs better than or comparable to the baseline Transformers on long-range sequence modeling tasks, while also achieving higher results on time and memory efficiency than other efficient transformers.

**ABSTRACT**  
We propose MusicRL, the first music generation system finetuned from human feedback. Appreciation of text-to-music models is particularly subjective since the concept of musicality as well as the specific intention behind a caption are user-dependent (e.g. a caption such as "upbeat work-out music" can map to a retro guitar solo or a techno pop beat). Not only this makes supervised training of such models challenging, but it also calls for integrating continuous human feedback in their post-deployment finetuning. MusicRL is a pretrained autoregressive MusicLM (Agostinelli et al., 2023) model of discrete audio tokens finetuned with reinforcement learning to maximise sequence-level rewards. We design reward functions related specifically to text-adherence and audio quality with the help from selected raters, and use those to finetune MusicLM into MusicRL-R. We deploy MusicLM to users and collect a substantial dataset comprising 300,000 pairwise preferences. Using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), we train MusicRL-U, the first text-to-music model that incorporates human feedback at scale. Human evaluations show that both MusicRL-R and MusicRL-U are preferred to the baseline. Ultimately, MusicRL-RU combines the two approaches and results in the best model according to human raters. Ablation studies shed light on the musical attributes influencing human preferences, indicating that text adherence and quality only account for a part of it. This underscores the prevalence of subjectivity in musical appreciation and calls for further involvement of human listeners in the finetuning of music generation models.

**ABSTRACT**  
Reinforcement learning algorithms need exploration to learn. However, unsupervised exploration prevents the deployment of such algorithms on safety-critical tasks and limits real-world deployment. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm called Ensemble Model Predictive Safety Certification that combines model-based deep reinforcement learning with tube-based model predictive control to correct the actions taken by a learning agent, keeping safety constraint violations at a minimum through planning. Our approach aims to reduce the amount of prior knowledge about the actual system by requiring only offline data generated by a safe controller. Our results show that we can achieve significantly fewer constraint violations than comparable reinforcement learning methods.

**ABSTRACT**  
Reinforcement Learning is a highly active research field with promising advancements. In the field of autonomous driving, however, often very simple scenarios are being examined. Common approaches use non-interpretable control commands as the action space and unstructured reward designs which lack structure. In this work, we introduce Informed Reinforcement Learning, where a structured rulebook is integrated as a knowledge source. We learn trajectories and asses them with a situation-aware reward design, leading to a dynamic reward which allows the agent to learn situations which require controlled traffic rule exceptions. Our method is applicable to arbitrary RL models. We successfully demonstrate high completion rates of complex scenarios with recent model-based agents.

**ABSTRACT**  
Most mathematical distortions used in ML are fundamentally integral in nature: $f$-divergences, Bregman divergences, (regularized) optimal transport distances, integral probability metrics, geodesic distances, etc. In this paper, we unveil a grounded theory and tools which can help improve these distortions to better cope with ML requirements. We start with a generalization of Riemann integration that also encapsulates functions that are not strictly additive but are, more generally, $t$-additive, as in nonextensive statistical mechanics. Notably, this recovers Volterra's product integral as a special case. We then generalize the Fundamental Theorem of calculus using an extension of the (Euclidean) derivative. This, along with a series of more specific Theorems, serves as a basis for results showing how one can specifically design, alter, or change fundamental properties of distortion measures in a simple way, with a special emphasis on geometric- and ML-related properties that are the metricity, hyperbolicity, and encoding. We show how to apply it to a problem that has recently gained traction in ML: hyperbolic embeddings with a "cheap" and accurate encoding along the hyperbolic vs Euclidean scale. We unveil a new application for which the Poincar\'e disk model has very appealing features, and our theory comes in handy: \textit{model} embeddings for boosted combinations of decision trees, trained using the log-loss (trees) and logistic loss (combinations).

**ABSTRACT**  
In recent years, attention-based transformers have achieved tremendous success across a variety of disciplines including natural languages. A key ingredient behind their success is the generative pretraining procedure, during which these models are trained on a large text corpus in an auto-regressive manner. To shed light on this phenomenon, we propose a new framework that allows both theory and systematic experiments to study the sequential modeling capabilities of transformers through the lens of Markov chains. Inspired by the Markovianity of natural languages, we model the data as a Markovian source and utilize this framework to systematically study the interplay between the data-distributional properties, the transformer architecture, the learnt distribution, and the final model performance. In particular, we theoretically characterize the loss landscape of single-layer transformers and show the existence of global minima and bad local minima contingent upon the specific data characteristics and the transformer architecture. Backed by experiments, we demonstrate that our theoretical findings are in congruence with the empirical results. We further investigate these findings in the broader context of higher order Markov chains and deeper architectures, and outline open problems in this arena.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recent works have shown that by using large pre-trained models along with learnable prompts, rehearsal-free methods for class-incremental learning (CIL) settings can achieve superior performance to prominent rehearsal-based ones. Rehearsal-free CIL methods struggle with distinguishing classes from different tasks, as those are not trained together. In this work we propose a regularization method based on virtual outliers to tighten decision boundaries of the classifier, such that confusion of classes among different tasks is mitigated. Recent prompt-based methods often require a pool of task-specific prompts, in order to prevent overwriting knowledge of previous tasks with that of the new task, leading to extra computation in querying and composing an appropriate prompt from the pool. This additional cost can be eliminated, without sacrificing accuracy, as we reveal in the paper. We illustrate that a simplified prompt-based method can achieve results comparable to previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods equipped with a prompt pool, using much less learnable parameters and lower inference cost. Our regularization method has demonstrated its compatibility with different prompt-based methods, boosting those previous SOTA rehearsal-free CIL methods' accuracy on the ImageNet-R and CIFAR-100 benchmarks.

**ABSTRACT**  
Efficient molecular modeling and design are crucial for the discovery and exploration of novel molecules, and the incorporation of deep learning methods has revolutionized this field. In particular, large language models (LLMs) offer a fresh approach to tackle scientific problems from a natural language processing (NLP) perspective, introducing a research paradigm called scientific language modeling (SLM). However, two key issues remain: how to quantify the match between model and data modalities and how to identify the knowledge-learning preferences of models. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-modal benchmark, named ChEBI-20-MM, and perform 1263 experiments to assess the model's compatibility with data modalities and knowledge acquisition. Through the modal transition probability matrix, we provide insights into the most suitable modalities for tasks. Furthermore, we introduce a statistically interpretable approach to discover context-specific knowledge mapping by localized feature filtering. Our pioneering analysis offers an exploration of the learning mechanism and paves the way for advancing SLM in molecular science.

**ABSTRACT**  
Learning in deep weight spaces (DWS), where neural networks process the weights of other neural networks, is an emerging research direction, with applications to 2D and 3D neural fields (INRs, NeRFs), as well as making inferences about other types of neural networks. Unfortunately, weight space models tend to suffer from substantial overfitting. We empirically analyze the reasons for this overfitting and find that a key reason is the lack of diversity in DWS datasets. While a given object can be represented by many different weight configurations, typical INR training sets fail to capture variability across INRs that represent the same object. To address this, we explore strategies for data augmentation in weight spaces and propose a MixUp method adapted for weight spaces. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods in two setups. In classification, they improve performance similarly to having up to 10 times more data. In self-supervised contrastive learning, they yield substantial 5-10% gains in downstream classification.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper presents advanced techniques of training diffusion policies for offline reinforcement learning (RL). At the core is a mean-reverting stochastic differential equation (SDE) that transfers a complex action distribution into a standard Gaussian and then samples actions conditioned on the environment state with a corresponding reverse-time SDE, like a typical diffusion policy. We show that such an SDE has a solution that we can use to calculate the log probability of the policy, yielding an entropy regularizer that improves the exploration of offline datasets. To mitigate the impact of inaccurate value functions from out-of-distribution data points, we further propose to learn the lower confidence bound of Q-ensembles for more robust policy improvement. By combining the entropy-regularized diffusion policy with Q-ensembles in offline RL, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on most tasks in D4RL benchmarks. Code is available at \href{https://github.com/ruoqizzz/Entropy-Regularized-Diffusion-Policy-with-QEnsemble}{https://github.com/ruoqizzz/Entropy-Regularized-Diffusion-Policy-with-QEnsemble}.

**ABSTRACT**  
Machine learning models, particularly language models, are notoriously difficult to introspect. Black-box models can mask both issues in model training and harmful biases. For human-in-the-loop processes, opaque predictions can drive lack of trust, limiting a model's impact even when it performs effectively. To address these issues, we introduce Retrieve to Explain (R2E). R2E is a retrieval-based language model that prioritizes amongst a pre-defined set of possible answers to a research question based on the evidence in a document corpus, using Shapley values to identify the relative importance of pieces of evidence to the final prediction. R2E can adapt to new evidence without retraining, and incorporate structured data through templating into natural language. We assess on the use case of drug target identification from published scientific literature, where we show that the model outperforms an industry-standard genetics-based approach on predicting clinical trial outcomes.

**ABSTRACT**  
The ubiquitous missing values cause the multivariate time series data to be partially observed, destroying the integrity of time series and hindering the effective time series data analysis. Recently deep learning imputation methods have demonstrated remarkable success in elevating the quality of corrupted time series data, subsequently enhancing performance in downstream tasks. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive survey on the recently proposed deep learning imputation methods. First, we propose a taxonomy for the reviewed methods, and then provide a structured review of these methods by highlighting their strengths and limitations. We also conduct empirical experiments to study different methods and compare their enhancement for downstream tasks. Finally, the open issues for future research on multivariate time series imputation are pointed out. All code and configurations of this work, including a regularly maintained multivariate time series imputation paper list, can be found in the GitHub repository~\url{https://github.com/WenjieDu/Awesome\_Imputation}.

**ABSTRACT**  
With the emergence of pretrained vision-language models (VLMs), considerable efforts have been devoted to fine-tuning them for downstream tasks. Despite the progress made in designing efficient fine-tuning methods, such methods require access to the model's parameters, which can be challenging as model owners often opt to provide their models as a black box to safeguard model ownership. This paper proposes a \textbf{C}ollabo\textbf{ra}tive \textbf{F}ine-\textbf{T}uning (\textbf{CraFT}) approach for fine-tuning black-box VLMs to downstream tasks, where one only has access to the input prompts and the output predictions of the model. CraFT comprises two modules, a prompt generation module for learning text prompts and a prediction refinement module for enhancing output predictions in residual style. Additionally, we introduce an auxiliary prediction-consistent loss to promote consistent optimization across these modules. These modules are optimized by a novel collaborative training algorithm. Extensive experiments on few-shot classification over 15 datasets demonstrate the superiority of CraFT. The results show that CraFT achieves a decent gain of about 12\% with 16-shot datasets and only 8,000 queries. Moreover, CraFT trains faster and uses only about 1/80 of the memory footprint for deployment, while sacrificing only 1.62\% compared to the white-box method.

**ABSTRACT**  
Hypergraph Neural Networks (HGNNs) have recently attracted much attention and exhibited satisfactory performance due to their superiority in high-order correlation modeling. However, it is noticed that the high-order modeling capability of hypergraph also brings increased computation complexity, which hinders its practical industrial deployment. In practice, we find that one key barrier to the efficient deployment of HGNNs is the high-order structural dependencies during inference. In this paper, we propose to bridge the gap between the HGNNs and inference-efficient Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLPs) to eliminate the hypergraph dependency of HGNNs and thus reduce computational complexity as well as improve inference speed. Specifically, we introduce LightHGNN and LightHGNN$^+$ for fast inference with low complexity. LightHGNN directly distills the knowledge from teacher HGNNs to student MLPs via soft labels, and LightHGNN$^+$ further explicitly injects reliable high-order correlations into the student MLPs to achieve topology-aware distillation and resistance to over-smoothing. Experiments on eight hypergraph datasets demonstrate that even without hypergraph dependency, the proposed LightHGNNs can still achieve competitive or even better performance than HGNNs and outperform vanilla MLPs by $16.3$ on average. Extensive experiments on three graph datasets further show the average best performance of our LightHGNNs compared with all other methods. Experiments on synthetic hypergraphs with 5.5w vertices indicate LightHGNNs can run $100\times$ faster than HGNNs, showcasing their ability for latency-sensitive deployments.

**ABSTRACT**  
Availability attacks can prevent the unauthorized use of private data and commercial datasets by generating imperceptible noise and making unlearnable examples before release. Ideally, the obtained unlearnability prevents algorithms from training usable models. When supervised learning (SL) algorithms have failed, a malicious data collector possibly resorts to contrastive learning (CL) algorithms to bypass the protection. Through evaluation, we have found that most of the existing methods are unable to achieve both supervised and contrastive unlearnability, which poses risks to data protection. Different from recent methods based on contrastive error minimization, we employ contrastive-like data augmentations in supervised error minimization or maximization frameworks to obtain attacks effective for both SL and CL. Our proposed AUE and AAP attacks achieve state-of-the-art worst-case unlearnability across SL and CL algorithms with less computation consumption, showcasing prospects in real-world applications.

**ABSTRACT**  
During both pretraining and fine-tuning, Large Language Models (\textbf{LLMs}) are trained on trillions of tokens of text of widely varying quality. Both phases of training typically involve heuristically filtering out ``low-quality'' or \textit{noisy} training samples, yet little is known quantitatively about how the type or intensity of noise affects downstream performance. In this work, we study how noise in chain of thought (\textbf{CoT}) impacts task performance in the highly-controlled setting of algorithmically solvable tasks. First, we develop the Traced Integer (\textbf{TInt}) framework to generate highly customizable noised execution traces for any arithmetic function on lists of integers. We then define two types of noise: \textit{static} noise, a local form of noise which is applied after the CoT trace is computed, and \textit{dynamic} noise, a global form of noise which propagates errors in the trace as it is computed. We then evaluate the test performance of pretrained models both prompted and fine-tuned on noised datasets with varying levels of dataset contamination and intensity. We find fine-tuned models are extremely robust to high levels of static noise but struggle significantly more with lower levels of dynamic noise. In contrast, few-shot prompted models appear more sensitive to even static noise. We conclude with a discussion of how our findings impact noise filtering best-practices, in particular emphasizing the importance of removing samples containing destructive dynamic noise with global errors.

**ABSTRACT**  
Random projections or sketches of gradients and Hessian vector products play an essential role in applications where one needs to store many such vectors while retaining accurate information about their relative geometry. Two important scenarios are training data attribution (tracing a model's behavior to the training data), where one needs to store a gradient for each training example, and the study of the spectrum of the Hessian (to analyze the training dynamics), where one needs to store multiple Hessian vector products. While sketches that use dense matrices are easy to implement, they are memory bound and cannot be scaled to modern neural networks. Motivated by work on the intrinsic dimension of neural networks, we propose and study a design space for scalable sketching algorithms. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in three applications: training data attribution, the analysis of the Hessian spectrum and the computation of the intrinsic dimension when fine-tuning pre-trained language models.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recent work in deep learning has shown strong empirical and theoretical evidence of an implicit low-rank bias: weight matrices in deep networks tend to be approximately low-rank and removing relatively small singular values during training or from available trained models may significantly reduce model size while maintaining or even improving model performance. However, the majority of the theoretical investigations around low-rank bias in neural networks deal with oversimplified deep linear networks. In this work, we consider general networks with nonlinear activations and the weight decay parameter, and we show the presence of an intriguing neural rank collapse phenomenon, connecting the low-rank bias of trained networks with networks' neural collapse properties: as the weight decay parameter grows, the rank of each layer in the network decreases proportionally to the within-class variability of the hidden-space embeddings of the previous layers. Our theoretical findings are supported by a range of experimental evaluations illustrating the phenomenon.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recent studies have highlighted the benefits of generating multiple synthetic datasets for supervised learning, from increased accuracy to more effective model selection and uncertainty estimation. These benefits have clear empirical support, but the theoretical understanding of them is currently very light. We seek to increase the theoretical understanding by deriving bias-variance decompositions for several settings of using multiple synthetic datasets. Our theory predicts multiple synthetic datasets to be especially beneficial for high-variance downstream predictors, and yields a simple rule of thumb to select the appropriate number of synthetic datasets in the case of mean-squared error and Brier score. We investigate how our theory works in practice by evaluating the performance of an ensemble over many synthetic datasets for several real datasets and downstream predictors. The results follow our theory, showing that our insights are also practically relevant.

**ABSTRACT**  
Deep Learning has revolutionized the field of AI and led to remarkable achievements in applications involving image and text data. Unfortunately, there is inconclusive evidence on the merits of neural networks for structured tabular data. In this paper, we introduce a large-scale empirical study comparing neural networks against gradient-boosted decision trees on tabular data, but also transformer-based architectures against traditional multi-layer perceptrons (MLP) with residual connections. In contrast to prior work, our empirical findings indicate that neural networks are competitive against decision trees. Furthermore, we assess that transformer-based architectures do not outperform simpler variants of traditional MLP architectures on tabular datasets. As a result, this paper helps the research and practitioner communities make informed choices on deploying neural networks on future tabular data applications.

**ABSTRACT**  
We revisit the classical result of Morris et al.~(AAAI'19) that message-passing graphs neural networks (MPNNs) are equal in their distinguishing power to the Weisfeiler--Leman (WL) isomorphism test.   Morris et al.~show their simulation result with ReLU activation function and $O(n)$-dimensional feature vectors, where $n$ is the number of nodes of the graph. Recently, by introducing randomness into the architecture, Aamand et al.~(NeurIPS'22) were able to improve this bound to $O(\log n)$-dimensional feature vectors, although at the expense of guaranteeing perfect simulation only with high probability.   In all these constructions, to guarantee equivalence to the WL test, the dimension of feature vectors in the MPNN has to increase with the size of the graphs. However, architectures used in practice have feature vectors of constant dimension. Thus, there is a gap between the guarantees provided by these results and the actual characteristics of architectures used in practice. In this paper we close this gap by showing that, for \emph{any} non-polynomial analytic (like the sigmoid) activation function, to guarantee that MPNNs are equivalent to the WL test, feature vectors of dimension $d=1$ is all we need, independently of the size of the graphs.   Our main technical insight is that for simulating multi-sets in the WL-test, it is enough to use linear independence of feature vectors over rationals instead of reals. Countability of the set of rationals together with nice properties of analytic functions allow us to carry out the simulation invariant over the iterations of the WL test without increasing the dimension of the feature vectors.

**ABSTRACT**  
Science originates with discovering new causal knowledge from a combination of known facts and observations. Traditional causal discovery approaches mainly rely on high-quality measured variables, usually given by human experts, to find causal relations. However, the causal variables are usually unavailable in a wide range of real-world applications. The rise of large language models (LLMs) that are trained to learn rich knowledge from the massive observations of the world, provides a new opportunity to assist with discovering high-level hidden variables from the raw observational data. Therefore, we introduce COAT: Causal representatiOn AssistanT. COAT incorporates LLMs as a factor proposer that extracts the potential causal factors from unstructured data. Moreover, LLMs can also be instructed to provide additional information used to collect data values (e.g., annotation criteria) and to further parse the raw unstructured data into structured data. The annotated data will be fed to a causal learning module (e.g., the FCI algorithm) that provides both rigorous explanations of the data, as well as useful feedback to further improve the extraction of causal factors by LLMs. We verify the effectiveness of COAT in uncovering the underlying causal system with two case studies of review rating analysis and neuropathic diagnosis.

**ABSTRACT**  
Traditional approaches in offline reinforcement learning aim to learn the optimal policy that maximizes the cumulative reward, also known as return. However, as applications broaden, it becomes increasingly crucial to train agents that not only maximize the returns, but align the actual return with a specified target return, giving control over the agent's performance. Decision Transformer (DT) optimizes a policy that generates actions conditioned on the target return through supervised learning and is equipped with a mechanism to control the agent using the target return. Despite being designed to align the actual return with the target return, we have empirically identified a discrepancy between the actual return and the target return in DT. In this paper, we propose Return-Aligned Decision Transformer (RADT), designed to effectively align the actual return with the target return. Our model decouples returns from the conventional input sequence, which typically consists of returns, states, and actions, to enhance the relationships between returns and states, as well as returns and actions. Extensive experiments show that RADT reduces the discrepancies between the actual return and the target return of DT-based methods.

**ABSTRACT**  
Bayesian optimization (BO) is a powerful approach for optimizing complex and expensive-to-evaluate black-box functions. Its importance is underscored in many applications, notably including hyperparameter tuning, but its efficacy depends on efficiently balancing exploration and exploitation. While there has been substantial progress in BO methods, striking this balance still remains a delicate process. In this light, we present \texttt{LLAMBO}, a novel approach that integrates the capabilities of large language models (LLM) within BO. At a high level, we frame the BO problem in natural language terms, enabling LLMs to iteratively propose promising solutions conditioned on historical evaluations. More specifically, we explore how combining contextual understanding, few-shot learning proficiency, and domain knowledge of LLMs can enhance various components of model-based BO. Our findings illustrate that \texttt{LLAMBO} is effective at zero-shot warmstarting, and improves surrogate modeling and candidate sampling, especially in the early stages of search when observations are sparse. Our approach is performed in context and does not require LLM finetuning. Additionally, it is modular by design, allowing individual components to be integrated into existing BO frameworks, or function cohesively as an end-to-end method. We empirically validate \texttt{LLAMBO}'s efficacy on the problem of hyperparameter tuning, highlighting strong empirical performance across a range of diverse benchmarks, proprietary, and synthetic tasks.

**ABSTRACT**  
Multistep returns, such as $n$-step returns and $\lambda$-returns, are commonly used to improve the sample efficiency of reinforcement learning (RL) methods. The variance of the multistep returns becomes the limiting factor in their length; looking too far into the future increases variance and reverses the benefits of multistep learning. In our work, we demonstrate the ability of compound returns -- weighted averages of $n$-step returns -- to reduce variance. We prove for the first time that any compound return with the same contraction modulus as a given $n$-step return has strictly lower variance. We additionally prove that this variance-reduction property improves the finite-sample complexity of temporal-difference learning under linear function approximation. Because general compound returns can be expensive to implement, we introduce two-bootstrap returns which reduce variance while remaining efficient, even when using minibatched experience replay. We conduct experiments showing that two-bootstrap returns can improve the sample efficiency of $n$-step deep RL agents, with little additional computational cost.

**ABSTRACT**  
Mechanistic interpretability (MI) aims to understand AI models by reverse-engineering the exact algorithms neural networks learn. Most works in MI so far have studied behaviors and capabilities that are trivial and token-aligned. However, most capabilities are not that trivial, which advocates for the study of hidden representations inside these networks as the unit of analysis. We do a literature review, formalize representations for features and behaviors, highlight their importance and evaluation, and perform some basic exploration in the mechanistic interpretability of representations. With discussion and exploratory results, we justify our position that studying representations is an important and under-studied field, and that currently established methods in MI are not sufficient to understand representations, thus pushing for the research community to work toward new frameworks for studying representations.

**ABSTRACT**  
Pretrained large language models (LLMs) exhibit exceptional general language processing capabilities but come with significant demands on memory and computational resources. As a powerful compression technology, binarization can extremely reduce model weights to a mere 1 bit, lowering the expensive computation and memory requirements. However, existing quantization techniques fall short of maintaining LLM performance under ultra-low bit-widths. In response to this challenge, we present BiLLM, a groundbreaking 1-bit post-training quantization scheme tailored for pretrained LLMs. Based on the weight distribution of LLMs, BiLLM first identifies and structurally selects salient weights, and minimizes the compression loss through an effective binary residual approximation strategy. Moreover, considering the bell-shaped distribution of the non-salient weights, we propose an optimal splitting search to group and binarize them accurately. BiLLM achieving for the first time high-accuracy inference (e.g. 8.41 perplexity on LLaMA2-70B) with only 1.08-bit weights across various LLMs families and evaluation metrics, outperforms SOTA quantization methods of LLM by significant margins. Moreover, BiLLM enables the binarization process of the LLM with 7 billion weights within 0.5 hours on a single GPU, demonstrating satisfactory time efficiency.

**ABSTRACT**  
Sparse computation offers a compelling solution for the inference of Large Language Models (LLMs) in low-resource scenarios by dynamically skipping the computation of inactive neurons. While traditional approaches focus on ReLU-based LLMs, leveraging zeros in activation values, we broaden the scope of sparse LLMs beyond zero activation values. We introduce a general method that defines neuron activation through neuron output magnitudes and a tailored magnitude threshold, demonstrating that non-ReLU LLMs also exhibit sparse activation. To find the most efficient activation function for sparse computation, we propose a systematic framework to examine the sparsity of LLMs from three aspects: the trade-off between sparsity and performance, the predictivity of sparsity, and the hardware affinity. We conduct thorough experiments on LLMs utilizing different activation functions, including ReLU, SwiGLU, ReGLU, and ReLU$^2$. The results indicate that models employing ReLU$^2$ excel across all three evaluation aspects, highlighting its potential as an efficient activation function for sparse LLMs. We will release the code to facilitate future research.

**ABSTRACT**  
Obtaining no-regret guarantees for reinforcement learning (RL) in the case of problems with continuous state and/or action spaces is still one of the major open challenges in the field. Recently, a variety of solutions have been proposed, but besides very specific settings, the general problem remains unsolved. In this paper, we introduce a novel structural assumption on the Markov decision processes (MDPs), namely $\nu-$smoothness, that generalizes most of the settings proposed so far (e.g., linear MDPs and Lipschitz MDPs). To face this challenging scenario, we propose two algorithms for regret minimization in $\nu-$smooth MDPs. Both algorithms build upon the idea of constructing an MDP representation through an orthogonal feature map based on Legendre polynomials. The first algorithm, \textsc{Legendre-Eleanor}, archives the no-regret property under weaker assumptions but is computationally inefficient, whereas the second one, \textsc{Legendre-LSVI}, runs in polynomial time, although for a smaller class of problems. After analyzing their regret properties, we compare our results with state-of-the-art ones from RL theory, showing that our algorithms achieve the best guarantees.

**ABSTRACT**  
Anomaly detection (AD) plays a pivotal role in numerous web-based applications, including malware detection, anti-money laundering, device failure detection, and network fault analysis. Most methods, which rely on unsupervised learning, are hard to reach satisfactory detection accuracy due to the lack of labels. Weakly Supervised Anomaly Detection (WSAD) has been introduced with a limited number of labeled anomaly samples to enhance model performance. Nevertheless, it is still challenging for models, trained on an inadequate amount of labeled data, to generalize to unseen anomalies. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework Knowledge-Data Alignment (KDAlign) to integrate rule knowledge, typically summarized by human experts, to supplement the limited labeled data. Specifically, we transpose these rules into the knowledge space and subsequently recast the incorporation of knowledge as the alignment of knowledge and data. To facilitate this alignment, we employ the Optimal Transport (OT) technique. We then incorporate the OT distance as an additional loss term to the original objective function of WSAD methodologies. Comprehensive experimental results on five real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed KDAlign framework markedly surpasses its state-of-the-art counterparts, achieving superior performance across various anomaly types.

**ABSTRACT**  
Decision trees are renowned for their interpretability capability to achieve high predictive performance, especially on tabular data. Traditionally, they are constructed through recursive algorithms, where they partition the data at every node in a tree. However, identifying the best partition is challenging, as decision trees optimized for local segments may not bring global generalization. To address this, we introduce MetaTree, which trains a transformer-based model on filtered outputs from classical algorithms to produce strong decision trees for classification. Specifically, we fit both greedy decision trees and optimized decision trees on a large number of datasets. We then train MetaTree to produce the trees that achieve strong generalization performance. This training enables MetaTree to not only emulate these algorithms, but also to intelligently adapt its strategy according to the context, thereby achieving superior generalization performance.

**ABSTRACT**  
In reinforcement Learning (RL), an instant reward signal is generated for each action of the agent, such that the agent learns to maximize the cumulative reward to obtain the optimal policy. However, in many real-world applications, the instant reward signals are not obtainable by the agent. Instead, the learner only obtains rewards at the ends of bags, where a bag is defined as a partial sequence of a complete trajectory. In this situation, the learner has to face the significant difficulty of exploring the unknown instant rewards in the bags, which could not be addressed by existing approaches, including those trajectory-based approaches that consider only complete trajectories and ignore the inner reward distributions. To formally study this situation, we introduce a novel RL setting termed Reinforcement Learning from Bagged Rewards (RLBR), where only the bagged rewards of sequences can be obtained. We provide the theoretical study to establish the connection between RLBR and standard RL in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). To effectively explore the reward distributions within the bagged rewards, we propose a Transformer-based reward model, the Reward Bag Transformer (RBT), which uses the self-attention mechanism for interpreting the contextual nuances and temporal dependencies within each bag. Extensive experimental analyses demonstrate the superiority of our method, particularly in its ability to mimic the original MDP's reward distribution, highlighting its proficiency in contextual understanding and adaptability to environmental dynamics.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recent advances in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) have opened up vast application prospects, including swarm control of drones, collaborative manipulation by robotic arms, and multi-target encirclement. However, potential security threats during the MARL deployment need more attention and thorough investigation. Recent researches reveal that an attacker can rapidly exploit the victim's vulnerabilities and generate adversarial policies, leading to the victim's failure in specific tasks. For example, reducing the winning rate of a superhuman-level Go AI to around 20%. They predominantly focus on two-player competitive environments, assuming attackers possess complete global state observation.   In this study, we unveil, for the first time, the capability of attackers to generate adversarial policies even when restricted to partial observations of the victims in multi-agent competitive environments. Specifically, we propose a novel black-box attack (SUB-PLAY), which incorporates the concept of constructing multiple subgames to mitigate the impact of partial observability and suggests the sharing of transitions among subpolicies to improve the exploitative ability of attackers. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of SUB-PLAY under three typical partial observability limitations. Visualization results indicate that adversarial policies induce significantly different activations of the victims' policy networks. Furthermore, we evaluate three potential defenses aimed at exploring ways to mitigate security threats posed by adversarial policies, providing constructive recommendations for deploying MARL in competitive environments.

**ABSTRACT**  
Text-attributed graphs (TAGs) present unique challenges for direct processing by Language Learning Models (LLMs), yet their extensive commonsense knowledge and robust reasoning capabilities offer great promise for node classification in TAGs. Prior research in this field has grappled with issues such as over-squashing, heterophily, and ineffective graph information integration, further compounded by inconsistencies in dataset partitioning and underutilization of advanced LLMs. To address these challenges, we introduce Similarity-based Neighbor Selection (SNS). Using SimCSE and advanced neighbor selection techniques, SNS effectively improves the quality of selected neighbors, thereby improving graph representation and alleviating issues like over-squashing and heterophily. Besides, as an inductive and training-free approach, SNS demonstrates superior generalization and scalability over traditional GNN methods. Our comprehensive experiments, adhering to standard dataset partitioning practices, demonstrate that SNS, through simple prompt interactions with LLMs, consistently outperforms vanilla GNNs and achieves state-of-the-art results on datasets like PubMed in node classification, showcasing LLMs' potential in graph structure understanding. Our research further underscores the significance of graph structure integration in LLM applications and identifies key factors for their success in node classification. Code is available at https://github.com/ruili33/SNS.

**ABSTRACT**  
In supervised learning, models are trained to extract correlations from a static dataset. This often leads to models that rely on high-level misconceptions. To prevent such misconceptions, we must necessarily provide additional information beyond the training data. Existing methods incorporate forms of additional instance-level supervision, such as labels for spurious features or additional labeled data from a balanced distribution. Such strategies can become prohibitively costly for large-scale datasets since they require additional annotation at a scale close to the original training data. We hypothesize that targeted natural language feedback about a model's misconceptions is a more efficient form of additional supervision. We introduce Clarify, a novel interface and method for interactively correcting model misconceptions. Through Clarify, users need only provide a short text description to describe a model's consistent failure patterns. Then, in an entirely automated way, we use such descriptions to improve the training process by reweighting the training data or gathering additional targeted data. Our user studies show that non-expert users can successfully describe model misconceptions via Clarify, improving worst-group accuracy by an average of 17.1% in two datasets. Additionally, we use Clarify to find and rectify 31 novel hard subpopulations in the ImageNet dataset, improving minority-split accuracy from 21.1% to 28.7%.

**ABSTRACT**  
Graph generation has been dominated by autoregressive models due to their simplicity and effectiveness, despite their sensitivity to ordering. Yet diffusion models have garnered increasing attention, as they offer comparable performance while being permutation-invariant. Current graph diffusion models generate graphs in a one-shot fashion, but they require extra features and thousands of denoising steps to achieve optimal performance. We introduce PARD, a Permutation-invariant Auto Regressive Diffusion model that integrates diffusion models with autoregressive methods. PARD harnesses the effectiveness and efficiency of the autoregressive model while maintaining permutation invariance without ordering sensitivity. Specifically, we show that contrary to sets, elements in a graph are not entirely unordered and there is a unique partial order for nodes and edges. With this partial order, PARD generates a graph in a block-by-block, autoregressive fashion, where each block's probability is conditionally modeled by a shared diffusion model with an equivariant network. To ensure efficiency while being expressive, we further propose a higher-order graph transformer, which integrates transformer with PPGN. Like GPT, we extend the higher-order graph transformer to support parallel training of all blocks. Without any extra features, PARD achieves state-of-the-art performance on molecular and non-molecular datasets, and scales to large datasets like MOSES containing 1.9M molecules.

**ABSTRACT**  
To handle AI tasks that combine perception and logical reasoning, recent work introduces Neurosymbolic Deep Neural Networks (NS-DNNs), which contain -- in addition to traditional neural layers -- symbolic layers: symbolic expressions (e.g., SAT formulas, logic programs) that are evaluated by symbolic solvers during inference. We identify and formalize an intuitive, high-level principle that can guide the design and analysis of NS-DNNs: symbol correctness, the correctness of the intermediate symbols predicted by the neural layers with respect to a (generally unknown) ground-truth symbolic representation of the input data. We demonstrate that symbol correctness is a necessary property for NS-DNN explainability and transfer learning (despite being in general impossible to train for). Moreover, we show that the framework of symbol correctness provides a precise way to reason and communicate about model behavior at neural-symbolic boundaries, and gives insight into the fundamental tradeoffs faced by NS-DNN training algorithms. In doing so, we both identify significant points of ambiguity in prior work, and provide a framework to support further NS-DNN developments.

**ABSTRACT**  
Explaining stock predictions is generally a difficult task for traditional non-generative deep learning models, where explanations are limited to visualizing the attention weights on important texts. Today, Large Language Models (LLMs) present a solution to this problem, given their known capabilities to generate human-readable explanations for their decision-making process. However, the task of stock prediction remains challenging for LLMs, as it requires the ability to weigh the varying impacts of chaotic social texts on stock prices. The problem gets progressively harder with the introduction of the explanation component, which requires LLMs to explain verbally why certain factors are more important than the others. On the other hand, to fine-tune LLMs for such a task, one would need expert-annotated samples of explanation for every stock movement in the training set, which is expensive and impractical to scale. To tackle these issues, we propose our Summarize-Explain-Predict (SEP) framework, which utilizes a self-reflective agent and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to let a LLM teach itself how to generate explainable stock predictions in a fully autonomous manner. The reflective agent learns how to explain past stock movements through self-reasoning, while the PPO trainer trains the model to generate the most likely explanations from input texts. The training samples for the PPO trainer are also the responses generated during the reflective process, which eliminates the need for human annotators. Using our SEP framework, we fine-tune a LLM that can outperform both traditional deep-learning and LLM methods in prediction accuracy and Matthews correlation coefficient for the stock classification task. To justify the generalization capability of our framework, we further test it on the portfolio construction task, and demonstrate its effectiveness through various portfolio metrics.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recent advancements have introduced machine learning frameworks to enhance the Branch and Bound (B\&B) branching policies for solving Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP). These methods, primarily relying on imitation learning of Strong Branching, have shown superior performance. However, collecting expert samples for imitation learning, particularly for Strong Branching, is a time-consuming endeavor. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{C}ontrastive Learning with \textbf{A}ugmented \textbf{M}ILPs for \textbf{Branch}ing (CAMBranch), a framework that generates Augmented MILPs (AMILPs) by applying variable shifting to limited expert data from their original MILPs. This approach enables the acquisition of a considerable number of labeled expert samples. CAMBranch leverages both MILPs and AMILPs for imitation learning and employs contrastive learning to enhance the model's ability to capture MILP features, thereby improving the quality of branching decisions. Experimental results demonstrate that CAMBranch, trained with only 10\% of the complete dataset, exhibits superior performance. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of our method.

**ABSTRACT**  
Network traffic refers to the amount of information being sent and received over the internet or any system that connects computers. Analyzing and understanding network traffic is vital for improving network security and management. However, the analysis of network traffic poses great challenges due to the unique characteristics of data packets, such as heterogeneous headers and encrypted payload lacking semantics. To capture the latent semantics of traffic, a few studies have adopted pre-training techniques based on the Transformer encoder or decoder to learn the representations from large-scale traffic data. However, these methods typically excel only in traffic understanding (classification) or traffic generation tasks. To address this issue, we develop Lens, a foundational network traffic model that leverages the T5 architecture to learn the pre-trained representations from large-scale unlabeled data. Harnessing the strength of the encoder-decoder framework, which captures the global information while preserving the generative ability, our model can better learn the representations from large-scale network traffic. To further enhance pre-training performance, we design a novel loss that integrates three distinct tasks, namely Masked Span Prediction (MSP), Packet Order Prediction (POP), and Homologous Traffic Prediction (HTP). Evaluation results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed Lens outperforms the baselines in most downstream tasks related to both traffic understanding and traffic generation. Notably, it also requires considerably less labeled data for fine-tuning compared to current methods.

**ABSTRACT**  
Memory-based Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (MDGNNs) are a family of dynamic graph neural networks that leverage a memory module to extract, distill, and memorize long-term temporal dependencies, leading to superior performance compared to memory-less counterparts. However, training MDGNNs faces the challenge of handling entangled temporal and structural dependencies, requiring sequential and chronological processing of data sequences to capture accurate temporal patterns. During the batch training, the temporal data points within the same batch will be processed in parallel, while their temporal dependencies are neglected. This issue is referred to as temporal discontinuity and restricts the effective temporal batch size, limiting data parallelism and reducing MDGNNs' flexibility in industrial applications. This paper studies the efficient training of MDGNNs at scale, focusing on the temporal discontinuity in training MDGNNs with large temporal batch sizes. We first conduct a theoretical study on the impact of temporal batch size on the convergence of MDGNN training. Based on the analysis, we propose PRES, an iterative prediction-correction scheme combined with a memory coherence learning objective to mitigate the effect of temporal discontinuity, enabling MDGNNs to be trained with significantly larger temporal batches without sacrificing generalization performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enables up to a 4x larger temporal batch (3.4x speed-up) during MDGNN training.

**ABSTRACT**  
Owing to recent advancements, Large Language Models (LLMs) can now be deployed as agents for increasingly complex decision-making applications in areas including robotics, gaming, and API integration. However, reflecting past experiences in current decision-making processes, an innate human behavior, continues to pose significant challenges. Addressing this, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Planning (RAP) framework, designed to dynamically leverage past experiences corresponding to the current situation and context, thereby enhancing agents' planning capabilities. RAP distinguishes itself by being versatile: it excels in both text-only and multimodal environments, making it suitable for a wide range of tasks. Empirical evaluations demonstrate RAP's effectiveness, where it achieves SOTA performance in textual scenarios and notably enhances multimodal LLM agents' performance for embodied tasks. These results highlight RAP's potential in advancing the functionality and applicability of LLM agents in complex, real-world applications.

**ABSTRACT**  
The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has emerged as a powerful and versatile tool for artificial intelligence (AI) applications. Conventional computing architectures face challenges in meeting the demanding processing requirements of compute-intensive CNN applications, as they suffer from limited throughput and low utilization. To this end, specialized accelerators have been developed to speed up CNN computations. However, as we demonstrate in this paper via extensive design space exploration, different neural network models have different characteristics, which calls for different accelerator architectures and configurations to match their computing demand. We show that a one-size-fits-all fixed architecture does not guarantee optimal power/energy/performance trade-off. To overcome this challenge, this paper proposes ARMAN, a novel reconfigurable systolic-array-based accelerator architecture based on Monolithic 3D (M3D) technology for CNN inference. The proposed accelerator offers the flexibility to reconfigure among different scale-up or scale-out arrangements depending on the neural network structure, providing the optimal trade-off across power, energy, and performance for various neural network models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through evaluations of multiple benchmarks. The results demonstrate that the proposed accelerator exhibits up to 2x, 2.24x, 1.48x, and 2x improvements in terms of execution cycles, power, energy, and EDP respectively, over the non-configurable architecture.

**ABSTRACT**  
In today's data centers, personalized recommendation systems face challenges such as the need for large memory capacity and high bandwidth, especially when performing embedding operations. Previous approaches have relied on DIMM-based near-memory processing techniques or introduced 3D-stacked DRAM to address memory-bound issues and expand memory bandwidth. However, these solutions fall short when dealing with the expanding size of personalized recommendation systems. Recommendation models have grown to sizes exceeding tens of terabytes, making them challenging to run efficiently on traditional single-node inference servers. Although various algorithmic methods have been proposed to reduce embedding table capacity, they often result in increased memory access or inefficient utilization of memory resources. This paper introduces HEAM, a heterogeneous memory architecture that integrates 3D-stacked DRAM with DIMM to accelerate recommendation systems in which compositional embedding is utilized-a technique aimed at reducing the size of embedding tables. The architecture is organized into a three-tier memory hierarchy consisting of conventional DIMM, 3D-stacked DRAM with a base die-level Processing-In-Memory (PIM), and a bank group-level PIM incorporating a Look-Up-Table. This setup is specifically designed to accommodate the unique aspects of compositional embedding, such as temporal locality and embedding table capacity. This design effectively reduces bank access, improves access efficiency, and enhances overall throughput, resulting in a 6.3 times speedup and 58.9% energy savings compared to the baseline.

**ABSTRACT**  
Weakly supervised learning with noisy data has drawn attention in the medical imaging community due to the sparsity of high-quality disease labels. However, little is known about the limitations of such weakly supervised learning and the effect of these constraints on disease classification performance. In this paper, we test the effects of such weak supervision by examining model tolerance for three conditions. First, we examined model tolerance for noisy data by incrementally increasing error in the labels within the training data. Second, we assessed the impact of dataset size by varying the amount of training data. Third, we compared performance differences between binary and multi-label classification. Results demonstrated that the model could endure up to 10% added label error before experiencing a decline in disease classification performance. Disease classification performance steadily rose as the amount of training data was increased for all disease classes, before experiencing a plateau in performance at 75% of training data. Last, the binary model outperformed the multilabel model in every disease category. However, such interpretations may be misleading, as the binary model was heavily influenced by co-occurring diseases and may not have learned the specific features of the disease in the image. In conclusion, this study may help the medical imaging community understand the benefits and risks of weak supervision with noisy labels. Such studies demonstrate the need to build diverse, large-scale datasets and to develop explainable and responsible AI.

**ABSTRACT**  
Studying the morphological development of cartilaginous and osseous structures is critical to the early detection of life-threatening skeletal dysmorphology. Embryonic cartilage undergoes rapid structural changes within hours, introducing biological variations and morphological shifts that limit the generalization of deep learning-based segmentation models that infer across multiple embryonic age groups. Obtaining individual models for each age group is expensive and less effective, while direct transfer (predicting an age unseen during training) suffers a potential performance drop due to morphological shifts. We propose a novel Transformer-based segmentation model with improved biological priors that better distills morphologically diverse information through conditional mechanisms. This enables a single model to accurately predict cartilage across multiple age groups. Experiments on the mice cartilage dataset show the superiority of our new model compared to other competitive segmentation models. Additional studies on a separate mice cartilage dataset with a distinct mutation show that our model generalizes well and effectively captures age-based cartilage morphology patterns.

**ABSTRACT**  
Domain generalization (DG) is an important problem that learns a model that can generalize to unseen test domains leveraging one or more source domains, under the assumption of shared label spaces. However, most DG methods assume access to abundant source data in the target label space, a requirement that proves overly stringent for numerous real-world applications, where acquiring the same label space as the target task is prohibitively expensive. For this setting, we tackle the multimodal version of the unsupervised domain generalization (UDG) problem, which uses a large task-agnostic unlabeled source dataset, such as LAION-2B during finetuning. Our framework does not explicitly assume any relationship between the source dataset and target task. Instead, it relies only on the premise that the source dataset can be efficiently searched in a joint vision-language space. For this multimodal UDG setting, we propose a novel method to build a small ($<$100K) subset of the source data in three simple steps: (1) diversified retrieval using label names as queries, (2) rank pseudo-labeling, and (3) clustering to find representative samples. To demonstrate the value of studying the multimodal UDG problem, we compare our results against state-of-the-art source-free DG and zero-shot (ZS) methods on their respective benchmarks and show up to 10% improvement in accuracy on 20 diverse target datasets. Additionally, our multi-stage dataset construction method achieves 3% improvement on average over nearest neighbors retrieval. Code is available: https://github.com/Chris210634/mudg

**ABSTRACT**  
In this work, we focused on deep learning image processing in the context of oral rare diseases, which pose challenges due to limited data availability. A crucial step involves teeth detection, segmentation and numbering in panoramic radiographs. To this end, we used a dataset consisting of 156 panoramic radiographs from individuals with rare oral diseases and labeled by experts. We trained the Detection Transformer (DETR) neural network for teeth detection, segmentation, and numbering the 52 teeth classes. In addition, we used data augmentation techniques, including geometric transformations. Finally, we generated new panoramic images using inpainting techniques with stable diffusion, by removing teeth from a panoramic radiograph and integrating teeth into it. The results showed a mAP exceeding 0,69 for DETR without data augmentation. The mAP was improved to 0,82 when data augmentation techniques are used. Furthermore, we observed promising performances when using new panoramic radiographs generated with inpainting technique, with mAP of 0,76.

**ABSTRACT**  
Scaling up contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP) is critical for empowering both vision and multimodal models. We present EVA-CLIP-18B, the largest and most powerful open-source CLIP model to date, with 18-billion parameters. With only 6-billion training samples seen, EVA-CLIP-18B achieves an exceptional 80.7% zero-shot top-1 accuracy averaged across 27 widely recognized image classification benchmarks, outperforming its forerunner EVA-CLIP (5-billion parameters) and other open-source CLIP models by a large margin. Remarkably, we observe a consistent performance improvement with the model size scaling of EVA-CLIP, despite maintaining a constant training dataset of 2-billion image-text pairs from LAION-2B and COYO-700M. This dataset is openly available and much smaller than the in-house datasets (e.g., DFN-5B, WebLI-10B) employed in other state-of-the-art CLIP models. EVA-CLIP-18B demonstrates the potential of EVA-style weak-to-strong visual model scaling. With our model weights made publicly available, we hope to facilitate future research in vision and multimodal foundation models.

**ABSTRACT**  
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated their widespread viability thanks to extensive training in aligning visual instructions to answers. However, this conclusive alignment leads models to ignore critical visual reasoning, and further result in failures on meticulous visual problems and unfaithful responses. In this paper, we propose Chain of Manipulations, a mechanism that enables VLMs to solve problems with a series of manipulations, where each manipulation refers to an operation on the visual input, either from intrinsic abilities (e.g., grounding) acquired through prior training or from imitating human-like behaviors (e.g., zoom in). This mechanism encourages VLMs to generate faithful responses with evidential visual reasoning, and permits users to trace error causes in the interpretable paths. We thus train CogCoM, a general 17B VLM with a memory-based compatible architecture endowed this reasoning mechanism. Experiments show that our model achieves the state-of-the-art performance across 8 benchmarks from 3 categories, and a limited number of training steps with the data swiftly gains a competitive performance. The code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/THUDM/CogCoM.

**ABSTRACT**  
Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable problem-solving capabilities in various vision fields (e.g., generic object recognition and grounding) based on strong visual semantic representation and language reasoning ability. However, whether MLLMs are sensitive to subtle visual spoof/forged clues and how they perform in the domain of face attack detection (e.g., face spoofing and forgery detection) is still unexplored. In this paper, we introduce a new benchmark, namely SHIELD, to evaluate the ability of MLLMs on face spoofing and forgery detection. Specifically, we design true/false and multiple-choice questions to evaluate multimodal face data in these two face security tasks. For the face anti-spoofing task, we evaluate three different modalities (i.e., RGB, infrared, depth) under four types of presentation attacks (i.e., print attack, replay attack, rigid mask, paper mask). For the face forgery detection task, we evaluate GAN-based and diffusion-based data with both visual and acoustic modalities. Each question is subjected to both zero-shot and few-shot tests under standard and chain of thought (COT) settings. The results indicate that MLLMs hold substantial potential in the face security domain, offering advantages over traditional specific models in terms of interpretability, multimodal flexible reasoning, and joint face spoof and forgery detection. Additionally, we develop a novel Multi-Attribute Chain of Thought (MA-COT) paradigm for describing and judging various task-specific and task-irrelevant attributes of face images, which provides rich task-related knowledge for subtle spoof/forged clue mining. Extensive experiments in separate face anti-spoofing, separate face forgery detection, and joint detection tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MA-COT.

**ABSTRACT**  
Currently, Transformer is the most popular architecture for image dehazing, but due to its large computational complexity, its ability to handle long-range dependency is limited on resource-constrained devices. To tackle this challenge, we introduce the U-shaped Vision Mamba (UVM-Net), an efficient single-image dehazing network. Inspired by the State Space Sequence Models (SSMs), a new deep sequence model known for its power to handle long sequences, we design a Bi-SSM block that integrates the local feature extraction ability of the convolutional layer with the ability of the SSM to capture long-range dependencies. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Our method provides a more highly efficient idea of long-range dependency modeling for image dehazing as well as other image restoration tasks. The URL of the code is \url{https://github.com/zzr-idam/UVM-Net}. Our method takes only \textbf{0.009} seconds to infer a $325 \times 325$ resolution image (100FPS) without I/O handling time.

**ABSTRACT**  
Road pavement detection and segmentation are critical for developing autonomous road repair systems. However, developing an instance segmentation method that simultaneously performs multi-class defect detection and segmentation is challenging due to the textural simplicity of road pavement image, the diversity of defect geometries, and the morphological ambiguity between classes. We propose a novel end-to-end method for multi-class road defect detection and segmentation. The proposed method comprises multiple spatial and channel-wise attention blocks available to learn global representations across spatial and channel-wise dimensions. Through these attention blocks, more globally generalised representations of morphological information (spatial characteristics) of road defects and colour and depth information of images can be learned. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, we conducted various ablation studies and comparisons with prior methods on a newly collected dataset annotated with nine road defect classes. The experiments show that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods for multi-class road defect detection and segmentation methods.

**ABSTRACT**  
In finetuning a large pretrained model to downstream tasks, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods can effectively finetune pretrained models with few trainable parameters, but suffer from high GPU memory consumption and slow training speed. Because learnable parameters from these methods are entangled with the pretrained model, gradients related to the frozen pretrained model's parameters have to be computed and stored during finetuning. We propose Low-rank Attention Side-Tuning (LAST), which disentangles the trainable module from the pretrained model by freezing not only parameters but also outputs of the pretrained network. LAST trains a side-network composed of only low-rank self-attention modules. By viewing the pretrained model as a frozen feature extractor, the side-network takes intermediate output from the pretrained model and focus on learning task-specific knowledge. We also show that LAST can be highly parallel across multiple optimization objectives, making it very efficient in downstream task adaptation, for example, in finding optimal hyperparameters. LAST outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on VTAB-1K and other visual adaptation tasks with roughly only 30\% of GPU memory footprint and 60\% of training time compared to existing PEFT methods, but achieves significantly higher accuracy.

**ABSTRACT**  
Intelligent vehicles of the future must be capable of understanding and navigating safely through their surroundings. Camera-based vehicle systems can use keypoints as well as objects as low- and high-level landmarks for GNSS-independent SLAM and visual odometry. To this end we propose YOLOPoint, a convolutional neural network model that simultaneously detects keypoints and objects in an image by combining YOLOv5 and SuperPoint to create a single forward-pass network that is both real-time capable and accurate. By using a shared backbone and a light-weight network structure, YOLOPoint is able to perform competitively on both the HPatches and KITTI benchmarks.

**ABSTRACT**  
In autonomous driving tasks, trajectory prediction in complex traffic environments requires adherence to real-world context conditions and behavior multimodalities. Existing methods predominantly rely on prior assumptions or generative models trained on curated data to learn road agents' stochastic behavior bounded by scene constraints. However, they often face mode averaging issues due to data imbalance and simplistic priors, and could even suffer from mode collapse due to unstable training and single ground truth supervision. These issues lead the existing methods to a loss of predictive diversity and adherence to the scene constraints. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel trajectory generator named Controllable Diffusion Trajectory (CDT), which integrates map information and social interactions into a Transformer-based conditional denoising diffusion model to guide the prediction of future trajectories. To ensure multimodality, we incorporate behavioral tokens to direct the trajectory's modes, such as going straight, turning right or left. Moreover, we incorporate the predicted endpoints as an alternative behavioral token into the CDT model to facilitate the prediction of accurate trajectories. Extensive experiments on the Argoverse 2 benchmark demonstrate that CDT excels in generating diverse and scene-compliant trajectories in complex urban settings.

**ABSTRACT**  
Adversarial examples generated by a surrogate model typically exhibit limited transferability to unknown target systems. To address this problem, many transferability enhancement approaches (e.g., input transformation and model augmentation) have been proposed. However, they show poor performances in attacking systems having different model genera from the surrogate model. In this paper, we propose a novel and generic attacking strategy, called Deformation-Constrained Warping Attack (DeCoWA), that can be effectively applied to cross model genus attack. Specifically, DeCoWA firstly augments input examples via an elastic deformation, namely Deformation-Constrained Warping (DeCoW), to obtain rich local details of the augmented input. To avoid severe distortion of global semantics led by random deformation, DeCoW further constrains the strength and direction of the warping transformation by a novel adaptive control strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the transferable examples crafted by our DeCoWA on CNN surrogates can significantly hinder the performance of Transformers (and vice versa) on various tasks, including image classification, video action recognition, and audio recognition. Code is made available at https://github.com/LinQinLiang/DeCoWA.

**ABSTRACT**  
Exemplar-Free Class Incremental Learning (EFCIL) aims to learn from a sequence of tasks without having access to previous task data. In this paper, we consider the challenging Cold Start scenario in which insufficient data is available in the first task to learn a high-quality backbone. This is especially challenging for EFCIL since it requires high plasticity, which results in feature drift which is difficult to compensate for in the exemplar-free setting. To address this problem, we propose a simple and effective approach that consolidates feature representations by regularizing drift in directions highly relevant to previous tasks and employs prototypes to reduce task-recency bias. Our method, called Elastic Feature Consolidation (EFC), exploits a tractable second-order approximation of feature drift based on an Empirical Feature Matrix (EFM). The EFM induces a pseudo-metric in feature space which we use to regularize feature drift in important directions and to update Gaussian prototypes used in a novel asymmetric cross entropy loss which effectively balances prototype rehearsal with data from new tasks. Experimental results on CIFAR-100, Tiny-ImageNet, ImageNet-Subset and ImageNet-1K demonstrate that Elastic Feature Consolidation is better able to learn new tasks by maintaining model plasticity and significantly outperform the state-of-the-art.

**ABSTRACT**  
Visual Question Answering (VQA) is a challenging task of predicting the answer to a question about the content of an image. It requires deep understanding of both the textual question and visual image. Prior works directly evaluate the answering models by simply calculating the accuracy of the predicted answers. However, the inner reasoning behind the prediction is disregarded in such a "black box" system, and we do not even know if one can trust the predictions. In some cases, the models still get the correct answers even when they focus on irrelevant visual regions or textual tokens, which makes the models unreliable and illogical. To generate both visual and textual rationales next to the predicted answer to the given image/question pair, we propose Convincing Rationales for VQA, CRVQA. Considering the extra annotations brought by the new outputs, {CRVQA} is trained and evaluated by samples converted from some existing VQA datasets and their visual labels. The extensive experiments demonstrate that the visual and textual rationales support the prediction of the answers, and further improve the accuracy. Furthermore, {CRVQA} achieves competitive performance on generic VQA datatsets in the zero-shot evaluation setting. The dataset and source code will be released under https://github.com/lik1996/CRVQA2024.

**ABSTRACT**  
Most advances in medical image recognition supporting clinical auxiliary diagnosis meet challenges due to the low-resource situation in the medical field, where annotations are highly expensive and professional. This low-resource problem can be alleviated by leveraging the transferable representations of large-scale pre-trained vision-language models via relevant medical text prompts. However, existing pre-trained vision-language models require domain experts to carefully design the medical prompts, which greatly increases the burden on clinicians. To address this problem, we propose a weakly supervised prompt learning method MedPrompt to automatically generate medical prompts, which includes an unsupervised pre-trained vision-language model and a weakly supervised prompt learning model. The unsupervised pre-trained vision-language model utilizes the natural correlation between medical images and corresponding medical texts for pre-training, without any manual annotations. The weakly supervised prompt learning model only utilizes the classes of images in the dataset to guide the learning of the specific class vector in the prompt, while the learning of other context vectors in the prompt requires no manual annotations for guidance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first model to automatically generate medical prompts. With these prompts, the pre-trained vision-language model can be freed from the strong expert dependency of manual annotation and manual prompt design. Experimental results show that the model using our automatically generated prompts outperforms its full-shot learning hand-crafted prompts counterparts with only a minimal number of labeled samples for few-shot learning, and reaches superior or comparable accuracy on zero-shot image classification. The proposed prompt generator is lightweight and therefore can be embedded into any network architecture.

**ABSTRACT**  
We introduce MobileVLM V2, a family of significantly improved vision language models upon MobileVLM, which proves that a delicate orchestration of novel architectural design, an improved training scheme tailored for mobile VLMs, and rich high-quality dataset curation can substantially benefit VLMs' performance. Specifically, MobileVLM V2 1.7B achieves better or on-par performance on standard VLM benchmarks compared with much larger VLMs at the 3B scale. Notably, our 3B model outperforms a large variety of VLMs at the 7B+ scale. Our models will be released at https://github.com/Meituan-AutoML/MobileVLM .

**ABSTRACT**  
Large language models (LLMs) have recently experienced remarkable progress, where the advent of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) has endowed LLMs with visual capabilities, leading to impressive performances in various multi-modal tasks. However, those powerful MLLMs such as GPT-4V still fail spectacularly when presented with certain image and text inputs. In this paper, we identify a typical class of inputs that baffles MLLMs, which consist of images that are highly relevant but inconsistent with answers, causing MLLMs to suffer from hallucination. To quantify the effect, we propose CorrelationQA, the first benchmark that assesses the hallucination level given spurious images. This benchmark contains 7,308 text-image pairs across 13 categories. Based on the proposed CorrelationQA, we conduct a thorough analysis on 9 mainstream MLLMs, illustrating that they universally suffer from this instinctive bias to varying degrees. We hope that our curated benchmark and evaluation results aid in better assessments of the MLLMs' robustness in the presence of misleading images.

**ABSTRACT**  
Automatic radiology report generation is booming due to its huge application potential for the healthcare industry. However, existing computer vision and natural language processing approaches to tackle this problem are limited in two aspects. First, when extracting image features, most of them neglect multi-view reasoning in vision and model single-view structure of medical images, such as space-view or channel-view. However, clinicians rely on multi-view imaging information for comprehensive judgment in daily clinical diagnosis. Second, when generating reports, they overlook context reasoning with multi-modal information and focus on pure textual optimization utilizing retrieval-based methods. We aim to address these two issues by proposing a model that better simulates clinicians' perspectives and generates more accurate reports. Given the above limitation in feature extraction, we propose a Globally-intensive Attention (GIA) module in the medical image encoder to simulate and integrate multi-view vision perception. GIA aims to learn three types of vision perception: depth view, space view, and pixel view. On the other hand, to address the above problem in report generation, we explore how to involve multi-modal signals to generate precisely matched reports, i.e., how to integrate previously predicted words with region-aware visual content in next word prediction. Specifically, we design a Visual Knowledge-guided Decoder (VKGD), which can adaptively consider how much the model needs to rely on visual information and previously predicted text to assist next word prediction. Hence, our final Intensive Vision-guided Network (IVGN) framework includes a GIA-guided Visual Encoder and the VKGD. Experiments on two commonly-used datasets IU X-Ray and MIMIC-CXR demonstrate the superior ability of our method compared with other state-of-the-art approaches.

**ABSTRACT**  
Can a lightweight Vision Transformer (ViT) match or exceed the performance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) like ResNet on small datasets with small image resolutions? This report demonstrates that a pure ViT can indeed achieve superior performance through pre-training, using a masked auto-encoder technique with minimal image scaling. Our experiments on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets involved ViT models with fewer than 3.65 million parameters and a multiply-accumulate (MAC) count below 0.27G, qualifying them as 'lightweight' models. Unlike previous approaches, our method attains state-of-the-art performance among similar lightweight transformer-based architectures without significantly scaling up images from CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. This achievement underscores the efficiency of our model, not only in handling small datasets but also in effectively processing images close to their original scale.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recent advancements in large language models have influenced the development of video large multimodal models (VLMMs). The previous approaches for VLMMs involved Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with instruction-tuned datasets, integrating LLM with visual encoders, and adding additional learnable modules. Video and text multimodal alignment remains challenging, primarily due to the deficient volume and quality of multimodal instruction-tune data compared to text-only data. We present a novel alignment strategy that employs multimodal AI system to oversee itself called Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF), providing self-preference feedback to refine itself and facilitating the alignment of video and text modalities. In specific, we propose context-aware reward modeling by providing detailed video descriptions as context during the generation of preference feedback in order to enrich the understanding of video content. Demonstrating enhanced performance across diverse video benchmarks, our multimodal RLAIF approach, VLM-RLAIF, outperforms existing approaches, including the SFT model. We commit to open-sourcing our code, models, and datasets to foster further research in this area.

**ABSTRACT**  
Current state-of-the-art Video-based Person Re-Identification (Re-ID) primarily relies on appearance features extracted by deep learning models. These methods are not applicable for long-term analysis in real-world scenarios where persons have changed clothes, making appearance information unreliable. In this work, we deal with the practical problem of Video-based Cloth-Changing Person Re-ID (VCCRe-ID) by proposing "Attention-based Shape and Gait Representations Learning" (ASGL) for VCCRe-ID. Our ASGL framework improves Re-ID performance under clothing variations by learning clothing-invariant gait cues using a Spatial-Temporal Graph Attention Network (ST-GAT). Given the 3D-skeleton-based spatial-temporal graph, our proposed ST-GAT comprises multi-head attention modules, which are able to enhance the robustness of gait embeddings under viewpoint changes and occlusions. The ST-GAT amplifies the important motion ranges and reduces the influence of noisy poses. Then, the multi-head learning module effectively reserves beneficial local temporal dynamics of movement. We also boost discriminative power of person representations by learning body shape cues using a GAT. Experiments on two large-scale VCCRe-ID datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 12.2% in rank-1 accuracy and 7.0% in mAP.

**ABSTRACT**  
Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image generation tasks, yet their practical deployment is restrained by the high memory and time consumption. While quantization paves a way for diffusion model compression and acceleration, existing methods totally fail when the models are quantized to low-bits. In this paper, we unravel three properties in quantized diffusion models that compromise the efficacy of current methods: imbalanced activation distributions, imprecise temporal information, and vulnerability to perturbations of specific modules. To alleviate the intensified low-bit quantization difficulty stemming from the distribution imbalance, we propose finetuning the quantized model to better adapt to the activation distribution. Building on this idea, we identify two critical types of quantized layers: those holding vital temporal information and those sensitive to reduced bit-width, and finetune them to mitigate performance degradation with efficiency. We empirically verify that our approach modifies the activation distribution and provides meaningful temporal information, facilitating easier and more accurate quantization. Our method is evaluated over three high-resolution image generation tasks and achieves state-of-the-art performance under various bit-width settings, as well as being the first method to generate readable images on full 4-bit (i.e. W4A4) Stable Diffusion.

**ABSTRACT**  
Multi-view 3D object detectors struggle with duplicate predictions due to the lack of depth information, resulting in false positive detections. In this study, we introduce BEAM, a novel Beta Distribution Ray Denoising approach that can be applied to any DETR-style multi-view 3D detector to explicitly incorporate structure prior knowledge of the scene. By generating rays from cameras to objects and sampling spatial denoising queries from the Beta distribution family along these rays, BEAM enhances the model's ability to distinguish spatial hard negative samples arising from ambiguous depths. BEAM is a plug-and-play technique that adds only marginal computational costs during training, while impressively preserving the inference speed. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on the NuScenes dataset demonstrate significant improvements over strong baselines, outperforming the state-of-the-art method StreamPETR by 1.9% mAP. The code will be available at https://github.com/LiewFeng/BEAM.

**ABSTRACT**  
The recent Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated remarkable zero-shot capability and flexible geometric prompting in general image segmentation. However, SAM often struggles when handling various unconventional images, such as aerial, medical, and non-RGB images. This paper presents CAT-SAM, a ConditionAl Tuning network that adapts SAM toward various unconventional target tasks with just few-shot target samples. CAT-SAM freezes the entire SAM and adapts its mask decoder and image encoder simultaneously with a small number of learnable parameters. The core design is a prompt bridge structure that enables decoder-conditioned joint tuning of the heavyweight image encoder and the lightweight mask decoder. The bridging maps the prompt token of the mask decoder to the image encoder, fostering synergic adaptation of the encoder and the decoder with mutual benefits. We develop two representative tuning strategies for the image encoder which leads to two CAT-SAM variants: one injecting learnable prompt tokens in the input space and the other inserting lightweight adapter networks. Extensive experiments over 11 unconventional tasks show that both CAT-SAM variants achieve superior target segmentation performance consistently even under the very challenging one-shot adaptation setup.

**ABSTRACT**  
New algorithms for embedding graphs have reduced the asymptotic complexity of finding low-dimensional representations. One-Hot Graph Encoder Embedding (GEE) uses a single, linear pass over edges and produces an embedding that converges asymptotically to the spectral embedding. The scaling and performance benefits of this approach have been limited by a serial implementation in an interpreted language. We refactor GEE into a parallel program in the Ligra graph engine that maps functions over the edges of the graph and uses lock-free atomic instrutions to prevent data races. On a graph with 1.8B edges, this results in a 500 times speedup over the original implementation and a 17 times speedup over a just-in-time compiled version.

**ABSTRACT**  
Efficient distributed training serves as a powerful catalyst and an essential foundation for the development of large-scale neural networks. In distributed training scenarios, various pipeline parallelism methods are cleverly designed and widely employed. In this paper, we propose ZeroPP, a highly efficient and flexible pipeline parallelism method that trades off pipeline bubbles, memory usage, and communication through adaptive scheduling units. ZeroPP achieves minimal pipeline bubbles by carefully staggering the computation tasks of forward, input gradient, and weight gradient within a scheduling unit. Additionally, ZeroPP optimizes the combination of pipeline parallelism and fully sharded data parallelism using a blockwise schedule. We conduct experiments with popular GPT-style models and observe up to a 30% increase in throughput compared to the state-of-the-art breath-first pipeline parallelism. Besides, our evaluation also demonstrates up to a 68% increase in throughput and a 10% reduction in memory consumption compared to the memory-efficient 1F1B method.

**ABSTRACT**  
As Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) become popular, libraries like PyTorch-Geometric (PyG) and Deep Graph Library (DGL) are proposed; these libraries have emerged as the de facto standard for implementing GNNs because they provide graph-oriented APIs and are purposefully designed to manage the inherent sparsity and irregularity in graph structures. However, these libraries show poor scalability on multi-core processors, which under-utilizes the available platform resources and limits the performance. This is because GNN training is a resource-intensive workload with high volume of irregular data accessing, and existing libraries fail to utilize the memory bandwidth efficiently. To address this challenge, we propose ARGO, a novel runtime system for GNN training that offers scalable performance. ARGO exploits multi-processing and core-binding techniques to improve platform resource utilization. We further develop an auto-tuner that searches for the optimal configuration for multi-processing and core-binding. The auto-tuner works automatically, making it completely transparent from the user. Furthermore, the auto-tuner allows ARGO to adapt to various platforms, GNN models, datasets, etc. We evaluate ARGO on two representative GNN models and four widely-used datasets on two platforms. With the proposed autotuner, ARGO is able to select a near-optimal configuration by exploring only 5% of the design space. ARGO speeds up state-of-the-art GNN libraries by up to 5.06x and 4.54x on a four-socket Ice Lake machine with 112 cores and a two-socket Sapphire Rapids machine with 64 cores, respectively. Finally, ARGO can seamlessly integrate into widely-used GNN libraries (e.g., DGL, PyG) with few lines of code and speed up GNN training.

**ABSTRACT**  
In the rapidly evolving landscape of blockchain technology, ensuring the integrity and security of data is paramount. This study delves into the security aspects of Merkle Trees, a fundamental component in blockchain architectures, such as Ethereum. We critically examine the susceptibility of Merkle Trees to hash collisions, a potential vulnerability that poses significant risks to data security within blockchain systems. Despite their widespread application, the collision resistance of Merkle Trees and their robustness against preimage attacks have not been thoroughly investigated, leading to a notable gap in the comprehensive understanding of blockchain security mechanisms. Our research endeavors to bridge this gap through a meticulous blend of theoretical analysis and empirical validation. We scrutinize the probability of root collisions in Merkle Trees, considering various factors such as hash length and path length within the tree. Our findings reveal a direct correlation between the increase in path length and the heightened probability of root collisions, thereby underscoring potential security vulnerabilities. Conversely, we observe that an increase in hash length significantly reduces the likelihood of collisions, highlighting its critical role in fortifying security. The insights garnered from our research offer valuable guidance for blockchain developers and researchers, aiming to bolster the security and operational efficacy of blockchain-based systems.

**ABSTRACT**  
In a zero-trust fabless paradigm, designers are increasingly concerned about hardware-based attacks on the semiconductor supply chain. Logic locking is a design-for-trust method that adds extra key-controlled gates in the circuits to prevent hardware intellectual property theft and overproduction. While attackers have traditionally relied on an oracle to attack logic-locked circuits, machine learning attacks have shown the ability to retrieve the secret key even without access to an oracle. In this paper, we first examine the limitations of state-of-the-art machine learning attacks and argue that the use of key hamming distance as the sole model-guiding structural metric is not always useful. Then, we develop, train, and test a corruptibility-aware graph neural network-based oracle-less attack on logic locking that takes into consideration both the structure and the behavior of the circuits. Our model is explainable in the sense that we analyze what the machine learning model has interpreted in the training process and how it can perform a successful attack. Chip designers may find this information beneficial in securing their designs while avoiding incremental fixes.

**ABSTRACT**  
Blockchain technology has emerged as a revolutionary tool in ensuring data integrity and security in digital transactions. However, the current approaches to data verification in blockchain systems, particularly in Ethereum, face challenges in terms of efficiency and computational overhead. The traditional use of Merkle Trees and cryptographic hash functions, while effective, leads to significant resource consumption, especially for large datasets. This highlights a gap in existing research: the need for more efficient methods of data verification in blockchain networks. Our study addresses this gap by proposing an innovative aggregation scheme for Zero-Knowledge Proofs within the structure of Merkle Trees. We develop a system that significantly reduces the size of the proof and the computational resources needed for its generation and verification. Our approach represents a paradigm shift in blockchain data verification, balancing security with efficiency. We conducted extensive experimental evaluations using real Ethereum block data to validate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme. The results demonstrate a drastic reduction in proof size and computational requirements compared to traditional methods, making the verification process more efficient and economically viable. Our contribution fills a critical research void, offering a scalable and secure solution for blockchain data verification. The implications of our work are far-reaching, enhancing the overall performance and adaptability of blockchain technology in various applications, from financial transactions to supply chain management.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper presents an innovative approach to recognizing personality traits using deep learning (DL) methods applied to electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. Within the framework of detecting the big five personality traits model encompassing extra-version, neuroticism, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness, the research explores the potential of ECG-derived spectrograms as informative features. Optimal window sizes for spectrogram generation are determined, and a convolutional neural network (CNN), specifically Resnet-18, and visual transformer (ViT) are employed for feature extraction and personality trait classification. The study utilizes the publicly available ASCERTAIN dataset, which comprises various physiological signals, including ECG recordings, collected from 58 participants during the presentation of video stimuli categorized by valence and arousal levels. The outcomes of this study demonstrate noteworthy performance in personality trait classification, consistently achieving F1-scores exceeding 0.9 across different window sizes and personality traits. These results emphasize the viability of ECG signal spectrograms as a valuable modality for personality trait recognition, with Resnet-18 exhibiting effectiveness in discerning distinct personality traits.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recent developments in computer graphics, hardware, artificial intelligence (AI), and human-computer interaction likely lead to extended reality (XR) devices and setups being more pervasive. While these devices and setups provide users with interactive, engaging, and immersive experiences with different sensing modalities, such as eye and hand trackers, many non-player characters are utilized in a pre-scripted way or by conventional AI techniques. In this paper, we argue for using large language models (LLMs) in XR by embedding them in virtual avatars or as narratives to facilitate more inclusive experiences through prompt engineering according to user profiles and fine-tuning the LLMs for particular purposes. We argue that such inclusion will facilitate diversity for XR use. In addition, we believe that with the versatile conversational capabilities of LLMs, users will engage more with XR environments, which might help XR be more used in everyday life. Lastly, we speculate that combining the information provided to LLM-powered environments by the users and the biometric data obtained through the sensors might lead to novel privacy invasions. While studying such possible privacy invasions, user privacy concerns and preferences should also be investigated. In summary, despite some challenges, embedding LLMs into XR is a promising and novel research area with several opportunities.

**ABSTRACT**  
The rapid development of generative AI (GenAI) models in computer vision necessitates effective evaluation methods to ensure their quality and fairness. Existing tools primarily focus on dataset quality assurance and model explainability, leaving a significant gap in GenAI output evaluation during model development. Current practices often depend on developers' subjective visual assessments, which may lack scalability and generalizability. This paper bridges this gap by conducting a formative study with GenAI model developers in an industrial setting. Our findings led to the development of GenLens, a visual analytic interface designed for the systematic evaluation of GenAI model outputs during the early stages of model development. GenLens offers a quantifiable approach for overviewing and annotating failure cases, customizing issue tags and classifications, and aggregating annotations from multiple users to enhance collaboration. A user study with model developers reveals that GenLens effectively enhances their workflow, evidenced by high satisfaction rates and a strong intent to integrate it into their practices. This research underscores the importance of robust early-stage evaluation tools in GenAI development, contributing to the advancement of fair and high-quality GenAI models.

**ABSTRACT**  
In the burgeoning field of autonomous vehicles (AVs), trajectory prediction remains a formidable challenge, especially in mixed autonomy environments. Traditional approaches often rely on computational methods such as time-series analysis. Our research diverges significantly by adopting an interdisciplinary approach that integrates principles of human cognition and observational behavior into trajectory prediction models for AVs. We introduce a novel "adaptive visual sector" mechanism that mimics the dynamic allocation of attention human drivers exhibit based on factors like spatial orientation, proximity, and driving speed. Additionally, we develop a "dynamic traffic graph" using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Graph Attention Networks (GAT) to capture spatio-temporal dependencies among agents. Benchmark tests on the NGSIM, HighD, and MoCAD datasets reveal that our model (GAVA) outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by at least 15.2%, 19.4%, and 12.0%, respectively. Our findings underscore the potential of leveraging human cognition principles to enhance the proficiency and adaptability of trajectory prediction algorithms in AVs. The code for the proposed model is available at our Github.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper introduces a system designed to generate explanations for the actions performed by an autonomous robot in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI). Explainability in robotics, encapsulated within the concept of an eXplainable Autonomous Robot (XAR), is a growing research area. The work described in this paper aims to take advantage of the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in performing natural language processing tasks. This study focuses on the possibility of generating explanations using such models in combination with a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) method to interpret data gathered from the logs of autonomous systems. In addition, this work also presents a formalization of the proposed explanation system. It has been evaluated through a navigation test from the European Robotics League (ERL), a Europe-wide social robotics competition. Regarding the obtained results, a validation questionnaire has been conducted to measure the quality of the explanations from the perspective of technical users. The results obtained during the experiment highlight the potential utility of LLMs in achieving explanatory capabilities in robots.

**ABSTRACT**  
Aerial robots have the potential to play a crucial role in assisting humans with complex and dangerous tasks. Nevertheless, the future industry demands innovative solutions to streamline the interaction process between humans and drones to enable seamless collaboration and efficient co-working. In this paper, we present a novel tele-immersive framework that promotes cognitive and physical collaboration between humans and robots through Mixed Reality (MR). This framework incorporates a novel bi-directional spatial awareness and a multi-modal virtual-physical interaction approaches. The former seamlessly integrates the physical and virtual worlds, offering bidirectional egocentric and exocentric environmental representations. The latter, leveraging the proposed spatial representation, further enhances the collaboration combining a robot planning algorithm for obstacle avoidance with a variable admittance control. This allows users to issue commands based on virtual forces while maintaining compatibility with the environment map. We validate the proposed approach by performing several collaborative planning and exploration tasks involving a drone and an user equipped with a MR headset.

**ABSTRACT**  
The recent advance in autonomous underwater robotics facilitates autonomous inspection tasks of offshore infrastructure. However, current inspection missions rely on predefined plans created offline, hampering the flexibility and autonomy of the inspection vehicle and the mission's success in case of unexpected events. In this work, we address these challenges by proposing a framework encompassing the modeling and verification of mission plans through Behavior Trees (BTs). This framework leverages the modularity of BTs to model onboard reactive behaviors, thus enabling autonomous plan executions, and uses BehaVerify to verify the mission's safety. Moreover, as a use case of this framework, we present a novel AI-enabled algorithm that aims for efficient, autonomous pipeline camera data collection. In a simulated environment, we demonstrate the framework's application to our proposed pipeline inspection algorithm. Our framework marks a significant step forward in the field of autonomous underwater robotics, promising to enhance the safety and success of underwater missions in practical, real-world applications. https://github.com/remaro-network/pipe_inspection_mission

**ABSTRACT**  
This work contributes a novel deep navigation policy that enables collision-free flight of aerial robots based on a modular approach exploiting deep collision encoding and reinforcement learning. The proposed solution builds upon a deep collision encoder that is trained on both simulated and real depth images using supervised learning such that it compresses the high-dimensional depth data to a low-dimensional latent space encoding collision information while accounting for the robot size. This compressed encoding is combined with an estimate of the robot's odometry and the desired target location to train a deep reinforcement learning navigation policy that offers low-latency computation and robust sim2real performance.

**ABSTRACT**  
Deep-learning and large scale language-image training have produced image object detectors that generalise well to diverse environments and semantic classes. However, single-image object detectors trained on internet data are not optimally tailored for the embodied conditions inherent in robotics. Instead, robots must detect objects from complex multi-modal data streams involving depth, localisation and temporal correlation, a task termed embodied object detection. Paradigms such as Video Object Detection (VOD) and Semantic Mapping have been proposed to leverage such embodied data streams, but existing work fails to enhance performance using language-image training. In response, we investigate how an image object detector pre-trained using language-image data can be extended to perform embodied object detection. We propose a novel implicit object memory that uses projective geometry to aggregate the features of detected objects across long temporal horizons. The spatial and temporal information accumulated in memory is then used to enhance the image features of the base detector. When tested on embodied data streams sampled from diverse indoor scenes, our approach improves the base object detector by 3.09 mAP, outperforming alternative external memories designed for VOD and Semantic Mapping. Our method also shows a significant improvement of 16.90 mAP relative to baselines that perform embodied object detection without first training on language-image data, and is robust to sensor noise and domain shift experienced in real-world deployment.

**ABSTRACT**  
In response to the evolving challenges posed by small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which possess the potential to transport harmful payloads or independently cause damage, we introduce MMAUD: a comprehensive Multi-Modal Anti-UAV Dataset. MMAUD addresses a critical gap in contemporary threat detection methodologies by focusing on drone detection, UAV-type classification, and trajectory estimation. MMAUD stands out by combining diverse sensory inputs, including stereo vision, various Lidars, Radars, and audio arrays. It offers a unique overhead aerial detection vital for addressing real-world scenarios with higher fidelity than datasets captured on specific vantage points using thermal and RGB. Additionally, MMAUD provides accurate Leica-generated ground truth data, enhancing credibility and enabling confident refinement of algorithms and models, which has never been seen in other datasets. Most existing works do not disclose their datasets, making MMAUD an invaluable resource for developing accurate and efficient solutions. Our proposed modalities are cost-effective and highly adaptable, allowing users to experiment and implement new UAV threat detection tools. Our dataset closely simulates real-world scenarios by incorporating ambient heavy machinery sounds. This approach enhances the dataset's applicability, capturing the exact challenges faced during proximate vehicular operations. It is expected that MMAUD can play a pivotal role in advancing UAV threat detection, classification, trajectory estimation capabilities, and beyond. Our dataset, codes, and designs will be available in https://github.com/ntu-aris/MMAUD.

**ABSTRACT**  
Despite their powerful semantic understanding and code generation capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) still face challenges when dealing with complex tasks. Multi agent strategy generation and motion control are highly complex domains that inherently require experts from multiple fields to collaborate. To enhance multi agent strategy generation and motion control, we propose an innovative architecture that employs the concept of a cloud edge end hierarchical structure. By leveraging multiple large language models with distinct areas of expertise, we can efficiently generate strategies and perform task decomposition. Introducing the cosine similarity approach,aligning task decomposition instructions with robot task sequences at the vector level, we can identify subtasks with incomplete task decomposition and iterate on them multiple times to ultimately generate executable machine task sequences.The robot is guided through these task sequences to complete tasks of higher complexity. With this architecture, we implement the process of natural language control of robots to perform complex tasks, and successfully address the challenge of multi agent execution of open tasks in open scenarios and the problem of task decomposition.

**ABSTRACT**  
Despite the remarkable code generation abilities of large language models LLMs, they still face challenges in complex task handling. Robot development, a highly intricate field, inherently demands human involvement in task allocation and collaborative teamwork . To enhance robot development, we propose an innovative automated collaboration framework inspired by real-world robot developers. This framework employs multiple LLMs in distinct roles analysts, programmers, and testers. Analysts delve deep into user requirements, enabling programmers to produce precise code, while testers fine-tune the parameters based on user feedback for practical robot application. Each LLM tackles diverse, critical tasks within the development process. Clear collaboration rules emulate real world teamwork among LLMs. Analysts, programmers, and testers form a cohesive team overseeing strategy, code, and parameter adjustments . Through this framework, we achieve complex robot development without requiring specialized knowledge, relying solely on non experts participation.

**ABSTRACT**  
Reward engineering has long been a challenge in Reinforcement Learning (RL) research, as it often requires extensive human effort and iterative processes of trial-and-error to design effective reward functions. In this paper, we propose RL-VLM-F, a method that automatically generates reward functions for agents to learn new tasks, using only a text description of the task goal and the agent's visual observations, by leveraging feedbacks from vision language foundation models (VLMs). The key to our approach is to query these models to give preferences over pairs of the agent's image observations based on the text description of the task goal, and then learn a reward function from the preference labels, rather than directly prompting these models to output a raw reward score, which can be noisy and inconsistent. We demonstrate that RL-VLM-F successfully produces effective rewards and policies across various domains - including classic control, as well as manipulation of rigid, articulated, and deformable objects - without the need for human supervision, outperforming prior methods that use large pretrained models for reward generation under the same assumptions.

**ABSTRACT**  
With the advent of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), various domains of science and engineering communites has leveraged data-driven surrogates to model complex systems from numerous sources of information (data). The proliferation has led to significant reduction in cost and time involved in development of superior systems designed to perform specific functionalities. A high proposition of such surrogates are built extensively fusing multiple sources of data, may it be published papers, patents, open repositories, or other resources. However, not much attention has been paid to the differences in quality and comprehensiveness of the known and unknown underlying physical parameters of the information sources that could have downstream implications during system optimization. Towards resolving this issue, a multi-source data fusion framework based on Latent Variable Gaussian Process (LVGP) is proposed. The individual data sources are tagged as a characteristic categorical variable that are mapped into a physically interpretable latent space, allowing the development of source-aware data fusion modeling. Additionally, a dissimilarity metric based on the latent variables of LVGP is introduced to study and understand the differences in the sources of data. The proposed approach is demonstrated on and analyzed through two mathematical (representative parabola problem, 2D Ackley function) and two materials science (design of FeCrAl and SmCoFe alloys) case studies. From the case studies, it is observed that compared to using single-source and source unaware ML models, the proposed multi-source data fusion framework can provide better predictions for sparse-data problems, interpretability regarding the sources, and enhanced modeling capabilities by taking advantage of the correlations and relationships among different sources.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this paper, we perform a non-asymptotic analysis of the federated linear stochastic approximation (FedLSA) algorithm. We explicitly quantify the bias introduced by local training with heterogeneous agents, and investigate the sample complexity of the algorithm. We show that the communication complexity of FedLSA scales polynomially with the desired precision $\epsilon$, which limits the benefits of federation. To overcome this, we propose SCAFFLSA, a novel variant of FedLSA, that uses control variates to correct the bias of local training, and prove its convergence without assumptions on statistical heterogeneity. We apply the proposed methodology to federated temporal difference learning with linear function approximation, and analyze the corresponding complexity improvements.

**ABSTRACT**  
Graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained popularity for various graph-related tasks. However, similar to deep neural networks, GNNs are also vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Empirical studies have shown that adversarially robust generalization has a pivotal role in establishing effective defense algorithms against adversarial attacks. In this paper, we contribute by providing adversarially robust generalization bounds for two kinds of popular GNNs, graph convolutional network (GCN) and message passing graph neural network, using the PAC-Bayesian framework. Our result reveals that spectral norm of the diffusion matrix on the graph and spectral norm of the weights as well as the perturbation factor govern the robust generalization bounds of both models. Our bounds are nontrivial generalizations of the results developed in (Liao et al., 2020) from the standard setting to adversarial setting while avoiding exponential dependence of the maximum node degree. As corollaries, we derive better PAC-Bayesian robust generalization bounds for GCN in the standard setting, which improve the bounds in (Liao et al., 2020) by avoiding exponential dependence on the maximum node degree.

**ABSTRACT**  
The increasing complexity of advanced machine learning models requires innovative approaches to manage computational resources effectively. One such method is the Early Exit strategy, which allows for adaptive computation by providing a mechanism to shorten the processing path for simpler data instances. In this paper, we propose EERO, a new methodology to translate the problem of early exiting to a problem of using multiple classifiers with reject option in order to better select the exiting head for each instance. We calibrate the probabilities of exiting at the different heads using aggregation with exponential weights to guarantee a fixed budget .We consider factors such as Bayesian risk, budget constraints, and head-specific budget consumption. Experimental results, conducted using a ResNet-18 model and a ConvNext architecture on Cifar and ImageNet datasets, demonstrate that our method not only effectively manages budget allocation but also enhances accuracy in overthinking scenarios.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this study, we consider the reliability assessment of anomaly detection (AD) using Variational Autoencoder (VAE). Over the last decade, VAE-based AD has been actively studied in various perspective, from method development to applied research. However, when the results of ADs are used in high-stakes decision-making, such as in medical diagnosis, it is necessary to ensure the reliability of the detected anomalies. In this study, we propose the VAE-AD Test as a method for quantifying the statistical reliability of VAE-based AD within the framework of statistical testing. Using the VAE-AD Test, the reliability of the anomaly regions detected by a VAE can be quantified in the form of p-values. This means that if an anomaly is declared when the p-value is below a certain threshold, it is possible to control the probability of false detection to a desired level. Since the VAE-AD Test is constructed based on a new statistical inference framework called selective inference, its validity is theoretically guaranteed in finite samples. To demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed VAE-AD Test, numerical experiments on artificial data and applications to brain image analysis are conducted.

**ABSTRACT**  
Unsupervised automatic speech recognition (ASR) aims to learn the mapping between the speech signal and its corresponding textual transcription without the supervision of paired speech-text data. A word/phoneme in the speech signal is represented by a segment of speech signal with variable length and unknown boundary, and this segmental structure makes learning the mapping between speech and text challenging, especially without paired data. In this paper, we propose REBORN, Reinforcement-Learned Boundary Segmentation with Iterative Training for Unsupervised ASR. REBORN alternates between (1) training a segmentation model that predicts the boundaries of the segmental structures in speech signals and (2) training the phoneme prediction model, whose input is a segmental structure segmented by the segmentation model, to predict a phoneme transcription. Since supervised data for training the segmentation model is not available, we use reinforcement learning to train the segmentation model to favor segmentations that yield phoneme sequence predictions with a lower perplexity. We conduct extensive experiments and find that under the same setting, REBORN outperforms all prior unsupervised ASR models on LibriSpeech, TIMIT, and five non-English languages in Multilingual LibriSpeech. We comprehensively analyze why the boundaries learned by REBORN improve the unsupervised ASR performance.

**ABSTRACT**  
Multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) problems often encounter the challenge of sparse rewards. This challenge becomes even more pronounced when coordination among agents is necessary. As performance depends not only on one agent's behavior but rather on the joint behavior of multiple agents, finding an adequate solution becomes significantly harder. In this context, a group of agents can benefit from actively exploring different joint strategies in order to determine the most efficient one. In this paper, we propose an approach for rewarding strategies where agents collectively exhibit novel behaviors. We present JIM (Joint Intrinsic Motivation), a multi-agent intrinsic motivation method that follows the centralized learning with decentralized execution paradigm. JIM rewards joint trajectories based on a centralized measure of novelty designed to function in continuous environments. We demonstrate the strengths of this approach both in a synthetic environment designed to reveal shortcomings of state-of-the-art MADRL methods, and in simulated robotic tasks. Results show that joint exploration is crucial for solving tasks where the optimal strategy requires a high level of coordination.

**ABSTRACT**  
The core is a central solution concept in cooperative game theory, defined as the set of feasible allocations or payments such that no subset of agents has incentive to break away and form their own subgroup or coalition. However, it has long been known that the core (and approximations, such as the least-core) are hard to compute. This limits our ability to analyze cooperative games in general, and to fully embrace cooperative game theory contributions in domains such as explainable AI (XAI), where the core can complement the Shapley values to identify influential features or instances supporting predictions by black-box models. We propose novel iterative algorithms for computing variants of the core, which avoid the computational bottleneck of many other approaches; namely solving large linear programs. As such, they scale better to very large problems as we demonstrate across different classes of cooperative games, including weighted voting games, induced subgraph games, and marginal contribution networks. We also explore our algorithms in the context of XAI, providing further evidence of the power of the core for such applications.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this work, we investigate to use Large Language Models (LLMs) for rumor detection on social media. However, it is challenging for LLMs to reason over the entire propagation information on social media, which contains news contents and numerous comments, due to LLMs may not concentrate on key clues in the complex propagation information, and have trouble in reasoning when facing massive and redundant information. Accordingly, we propose an LLM-empowered Rumor Detection (LeRuD) approach, in which we design prompts to teach LLMs to reason over important clues in news and comments, and divide the entire propagation information into a Chain-of-Propagation for reducing LLMs' burden. We conduct extensive experiments on the Twitter and Weibo datasets, and LeRuD outperforms several state-of-the-art rumor detection models by 3.2% to 7.7%. Meanwhile, by applying LLMs, LeRuD requires no data for training, and thus shows more promising rumor detection ability in few-shot or zero-shot scenarios.

**ABSTRACT**  
Common click-through rate (CTR) prediction recommender models tend to exhibit feature-level bias, which leads to unfair recommendations among item groups and inaccurate recommendations for users. While existing methods address this issue by adjusting the learning of CTR models, such as through additional optimization objectives, they fail to consider how the bias is caused within these models. To address this research gap, our study performs a top-down analysis on representative CTR models. Through blocking different components of a trained CTR model one by one, we identify the key contribution of the linear component to feature-level bias. We conduct a theoretical analysis of the learning process for the weights in the linear component, revealing how group-wise properties of training data influence them. Our experimental and statistical analyses demonstrate a strong correlation between imbalanced positive sample ratios across item groups and feature-level bias. Based on this understanding, we propose a minimally invasive yet effective strategy to counteract feature-level bias in CTR models by removing the biased linear weights from trained models. Additionally, we present a linear weight adjusting strategy that requires fewer random exposure records than relevant debiasing methods. The superiority of our proposed strategies are validated through extensive experiments on three real-world datasets.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper explores the integration of Explainable Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) in the realm of financial engineering, specifically focusing on its application in credit decision-making. The rapid evolution of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in finance has necessitated a balance between sophisticated algorithmic decision-making and the need for transparency in these systems. The focus is on how AutoML can streamline the development of robust machine learning models for credit scoring, while Explainable AI (XAI) methods, particularly SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), provide insights into the models' decision-making processes. This study demonstrates how the combination of AutoML and XAI not only enhances the efficiency and accuracy of credit decisions but also fosters trust and collaboration between humans and AI systems. The findings underscore the potential of explainable AutoML in improving the transparency and accountability of AI-driven financial decisions, aligning with regulatory requirements and ethical considerations.

**ABSTRACT**  
Molecular Relational Learning (MRL), aiming to understand interactions between molecular pairs, plays a pivotal role in advancing biochemical research. Recently, the adoption of large language models (LLMs), known for their vast knowledge repositories and advanced logical inference capabilities, has emerged as a promising way for efficient and effective MRL. Despite their potential, these methods predominantly rely on the textual data, thus not fully harnessing the wealth of structural information inherent in molecular graphs. Moreover, the absence of a unified framework exacerbates the information underutilization, as it hinders the sharing of interaction rationale learned across diverse datasets. To address these challenges, this work proposes a novel LLM-based multi-modal framework for Molecular inTeraction prediction following Chain-of-Thought (CoT) theory, termed MolTC, which can efficiently integrate rich graphical information of molecular pairs. For achieving a unified MRL, MolTC innovatively develops a dynamic parameter-sharing strategy for cross-dataset information exchange, and introduces a Multi-hierarchical CoT principle to refine training paradigm. Our experiments, conducted across twelve varied datasets involving over 4,000,000 molecular pairs, demonstrate the superiority of our method over current GNN and LLM-based baselines. On the top of that, a comprehensive Molecular Interactive Instructions dataset is constructed for the development of biochemical LLM, including our MolTC. Code is available at https://github.com/MangoKiller/MolTC.

**ABSTRACT**  
Bioinformatics has witnessed a paradigm shift with the increasing integration of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly through the adoption of foundation models (FMs). These AI techniques have rapidly advanced, addressing historical challenges in bioinformatics such as the scarcity of annotated data and the presence of data noise. FMs are particularly adept at handling large-scale, unlabeled data, a common scenario in biological contexts due to the time-consuming and costly nature of experimentally determining labeled data. This characteristic has allowed FMs to excel and achieve notable results in various downstream validation tasks, demonstrating their ability to represent diverse biological entities effectively. Undoubtedly, FMs have ushered in a new era in computational biology, especially in the realm of deep learning. The primary goal of this survey is to conduct a systematic investigation and summary of FMs in bioinformatics, tracing their evolution, current research status, and the methodologies employed. Central to our focus is the application of FMs to specific biological problems, aiming to guide the research community in choosing appropriate FMs for their research needs. We delve into the specifics of the problem at hand including sequence analysis, structure prediction, function annotation, and multimodal integration, comparing the structures and advancements against traditional methods. Furthermore, the review analyses challenges and limitations faced by FMs in biology, such as data noise, model explainability, and potential biases. Finally, we outline potential development paths and strategies for FMs in future biological research, setting the stage for continued innovation and application in this rapidly evolving field. This comprehensive review serves not only as an academic resource but also as a roadmap for future explorations and applications of FMs in biology.

**ABSTRACT**  
The kick-off of vaccination campaigns in Europe, starting in late December 2020, has been followed by the online spread of controversies and conspiracies surrounding vaccine validity and efficacy. We study Twitter discussions in three major European languages (Italian, German, and French) during the vaccination campaign. Moving beyond content analysis to explore the structural aspects of online discussions, our investigation includes an analysis of polarization and the potential formation of echo chambers, revealing nuanced behavioral and topical differences in user interactions across the analyzed countries. Notably, we identify strong anti- and pro-vaccine factions exhibiting heterogeneous temporal polarization patterns in different countries. Through a detailed examination of news-sharing sources, we uncover the widespread use of other media platforms like Telegram and YouTube for disseminating low-credibility information, indicating a concerning trend of diminishing news credibility over time. Our findings on Twitter discussions during the COVID-19 vaccination campaign in major European languages expose nuanced behavioral distinctions, revealing the profound impact of polarization and the emergence of distinct anti-vaccine and pro-vaccine advocates over time.

**ABSTRACT**  
The detection of automated accounts, also known as "social bots", has been an increasingly important concern for online social networks (OSNs). While several methods have been proposed for detecting social bots, significant research gaps remain. First, current models exhibit limitations in detecting sophisticated bots that aim to mimic genuine OSN users. Second, these methods often rely on simplistic profile features, which are susceptible to manipulation. In addition to their vulnerability to adversarial manipulations, these models lack generalizability, resulting in subpar performance when trained on one dataset and tested on another.   To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework for social Bot detection with Self-Supervised Contrastive Learning (BotSSCL). Our framework leverages contrastive learning to distinguish between social bots and humans in the embedding space to improve linear separability. The high-level representations derived by BotSSCL enhance its resilience to variations in data distribution and ensure generalizability. We evaluate BotSSCL's robustness against adversarial attempts to manipulate bot accounts to evade detection. Experiments on two datasets featuring sophisticated bots demonstrate that BotSSCL outperforms other supervised, unsupervised, and self-supervised baseline methods. We achieve approx. 6% and approx. 8% higher (F1) performance than SOTA on both datasets. In addition, BotSSCL also achieves 67% F1 when trained on one dataset and tested with another, demonstrating its generalizability. Lastly, BotSSCL increases adversarial complexity and only allows 4% success to the adversary in evading detection.

**ABSTRACT**  
Academic achievement is a critical measure of intellectual ability, prompting extensive research into cognitive tasks as potential predictors. Neuroimaging technologies, such as functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), offer insights into brain hemodynamics, allowing understanding of the link between cognitive performance and academic achievement. Herein, we explored the association between cognitive tasks and academic achievement by analyzing prefrontal fNIRS signals. A novel quantum annealer (QA) feature selection algorithm was applied to fNIRS data to identify cognitive tasks correlated with CSAT scores. Twelve features (signal mean, median, variance, peak, number of peaks, sum of peaks, slope, minimum, kurtosis, skewness, standard deviation, and root mean square) were extracted from fNIRS signals at two time windows (10- and 60-second) to compare results from various feature variable conditions. The feature selection results from the QA-based and XGBoost regressor algorithms were compared to validate the former's performance. In a three-step validation process using multiple linear regression models, correlation coefficients between the feature variables and the CSAT scores, model fitness (adjusted R2), and model prediction error (RMSE) values were calculated. The quantum annealer demonstrated comparable performance to classical machine learning models, and specific cognitive tasks, including verbal fluency, recognition, and the Corsi block tapping task, were correlated with academic achievement. Group analyses revealed stronger associations between Tower of London and N-back tasks with higher CSAT scores. Quantum annealing algorithms have significant potential in feature selection using fNIRS data, and represents a novel research approach. Future studies should explore predictors of academic achievement and cognitive ability.
