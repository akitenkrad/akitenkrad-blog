**ABSTRACT**  
Humans make numerous inferences in text comprehension to understand discourse. This paper aims to understand the commonalities and disparities in the inference judgments between humans and state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs). Leveraging a comprehensively curated entailment verification benchmark, we evaluate both human and <b>LLM</b> performance across various <b>reasoning</b> categories. Our benchmark includes datasets from three categories (NLI, contextual QA, and rationales) that include multi-sentence premises and different knowledge types, thereby evaluating the inference capabilities in complex <b>reasoning</b> instances. Notably, our findings reveal LLMs' superiority in multi-hop <b>reasoning</b> across extended contexts, while humans excel in tasks necessitating simple deductive reasoning. Leveraging these insights, we introduce a fine-tuned Flan-T5 model that outperforms <b>GPT-3.5</b> and rivals with GPT-4, offering a robust open-source solution for entailment verification. As a practical application, we showcase the efficacy of our finetuned model in enhancing self-consistency in model-generated explanations, resulting in a 6% performance boost on average across three multiple-choice question-answering datasets.

**ABSTRACT**  
While recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have proven useful in answering user queries, they are prone to hallucination, and their responses often lack credibility due to missing references to reliable sources. An intuitive solution to these issues would be to include in-text citations referring to external documents as evidence. While previous works have directly prompted LLMs to generate in-text citations, their performances are far from satisfactory, especially when it comes to smaller LLMs. In this work, we propose an effective training framework using fine-grained rewards to teach LLMs to generate highly supportive and relevant citations, while ensuring the correctness of their responses. We also conduct a systematic analysis of applying these fine-grained rewards to common <b>LLM</b> training strategies, demonstrating its advantage over conventional practices. We conduct extensive experiments on <b>Question</b> <b>Answering</b> (QA) datasets taken from the ALCE benchmark and validate the model's generalizability using EXPERTQA. On LLaMA-2-7B, the incorporation of fine-grained rewards achieves the best performance among the baselines, even surpassing that of GPT-3.5-turbo.

**ABSTRACT**  
Scaling laws provide important insights that can guide the design of large language models (LLMs). Existing work has primarily focused on studying scaling laws for pretraining (upstream) loss. However, in <b>transfer</b> <b>learning</b> settings, in which LLMs are pretrained on an <b>unsupervised</b> dataset and then finetuned on a downstream task, we often also care about the downstream performance. In this work, we study the scaling behavior in a <b>transfer</b> <b>learning</b> setting, where LLMs are finetuned for <b>machine</b> <b>translation</b> tasks. Specifically, we investigate how the choice of the pretraining data and its size affect downstream performance (translation quality) as judged by two metrics: downstream cross-entropy and <b>BLEU</b> score. Our experiments indicate that the size of the finetuning dataset and the distribution alignment between the pretraining and downstream data significantly influence the scaling behavior. With sufficient alignment, both downstream cross-entropy and <b>BLEU</b> score improve monotonically with more pretraining data. In such cases, we show that it is possible to predict the downstream <b>BLEU</b> score with good accuracy using a log-law. However, there are also cases where moderate misalignment causes the <b>BLEU</b> score to fluctuate or get worse with more pretraining, whereas downstream cross-entropy monotonically improves. By analyzing these observations, we provide new practical insights for choosing appropriate pretraining data.

**ABSTRACT**  
Controllable <b>text</b> <b>generation</b> is a growing field within <b>natural</b> <b>language</b> <b>generation</b> (NLG) that focuses on producing text that meets specific constraints in real-world applications. Previous approaches, such as plug-and-play controllers (PPCs), aimed to steer the properties of generated text in a flexible manner. However, these methods often compromised the integrity of the language model's decoding process, resulting in less smooth text generation. Alternatively, other techniques utilized multiple attribute prompts to align the generated text with desired attributes, but this approach required <b>prompt</b> design for each attribute and was dependent on the size of the language model. This paper introduces a novel method for flexible attribute control in <b>text</b> <b>generation</b> using pre-trained language models (PLMs). The proposed approach aims to enhance the fluency of generated text by guiding the generation process with PPCs. The key idea is to dynamically adjust the distribution of generated text by modifying prompts, effectively constraining the output space of the language model and influencing the desired attribute. To enable smooth cooperation between the <b>PLM</b> and the PPC, our work innovatively proposes a new model <b>fine-tuning</b> method: <b>Reinforcement</b> <b>Learning</b> with Dynamic Adjust Feedback (RLDAF).This <b>fine-tuning</b> process adapts a small subset of the language model's parameters based on the generating actions taken during the PPC control process. The resulting harmonious collaboration between the <b>PLM</b> and PPC leads to improved smoothness in <b>text</b> <b>generation</b> during inference. Extensive experiments were conducted on the SST2 dataset, and the proposed method outperformed previous approaches in various evaluation metrics, including text fluency and attribute consistency.

**ABSTRACT**  
Massive open online courses (MOOCs) unlock the doors to free education for anyone around the globe with access to a computer and the internet. Despite this democratization of learning, the massive enrollment in these courses means it is almost impossible for one instructor to assess every student's writing assignment. As a result, peer grading, often guided by a straightforward rubric, is the method of choice. While convenient, peer grading often falls short in terms of reliability and validity. In this study, using 18 distinct settings, we explore the feasibility of leveraging large language models (LLMs) to replace peer grading in MOOCs. Specifically, we focus on two state-of-the-art LLMs: <b>GPT-4</b> and GPT-3.5, across three distinct courses: Introductory Astronomy, Astrobiology, and the History and Philosophy of Astronomy. To instruct LLMs, we use three different prompts based on a variant of the <b>zero-shot</b> chain-of-thought (Zero-shot-CoT) prompting technique: Zero-shot-CoT combined with instructor-provided correct answers; Zero-shot-CoT in conjunction with both instructor-formulated answers and rubrics; and Zero-shot-CoT with instructor-offered correct answers and LLM-generated rubrics. Our results show that Zero-shot-CoT, when integrated with instructor-provided answers and rubrics, produces grades that are more aligned with those assigned by instructors compared to peer grading. However, the History and Philosophy of Astronomy course proves to be more challenging in terms of grading as opposed to other courses. Finally, our study reveals a promising direction for automating grading systems for MOOCs, especially in subjects with well-defined rubrics.

**ABSTRACT**  
Prescription contraceptives play a critical role in supporting women's reproductive health. With nearly 50 million women in the United States using contraceptives, understanding the factors that drive contraceptives selection and switching is of significant interest. However, many factors related to medication switching are often only captured in unstructured clinical notes and can be difficult to extract. Here, we evaluate the <b>zero-shot</b> abilities of a recently developed large language model, <b>GPT-4</b> (via HIPAA-compliant Microsoft Azure API), to identify reasons for switching between classes of contraceptives from the UCSF Information Commons clinical notes dataset. We demonstrate that <b>GPT-4</b> can accurately extract reasons for contraceptive switching, outperforming baseline BERT-based models with microF1 scores of 0.849 and 0.881 for contraceptive start and stop extraction, respectively. Human evaluation of GPT-4-extracted reasons for switching showed 91.4% accuracy, with minimal hallucinations. Using extracted reasons, we identified patient preference, adverse events, and insurance as key reasons for switching using <b>unsupervised</b> <b>topic</b> <b>modeling</b> approaches. Notably, we also showed using our approach that "weight gain/mood change" and "insurance coverage" are disproportionately found as reasons for contraceptive switching in specific demographic populations. Our code and supplemental data are available at https://github.com/BMiao10/contraceptive-switching.

**ABSTRACT**  
No two authors write alike. Personal flourishes invoked in written narratives, from lexicon to rhetorical devices, imply a particular author--what literary theorists label the implied or virtual author; distinct from the real author or narrator of a text. Early large language models trained on unfiltered training sets drawn from a variety of discordant sources yielded incoherent personalities, problematic for conversational tasks but proving useful for sampling literature from multiple perspectives. Successes in alignment research in recent years have allowed researchers to impose subjectively consistent personae on language models via <b>instruction</b> <b>tuning</b> and <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning</b> from human feedback (RLHF), but whether aligned models retain the ability to model an arbitrary virtual author has received little scrutiny. By studying 4,374 stories sampled from three OpenAI language models, we show successive versions of <b>GPT-3</b> suffer from increasing degrees of "mode collapse" whereby overfitting the model during alignment constrains it from generalizing over authorship: models suffering from mode collapse become unable to assume a multiplicity of perspectives. Our method and results are significant for researchers seeking to employ language models in sociological simulations.

**ABSTRACT**  
Skill Extraction involves identifying skills and qualifications mentioned in documents such as job postings and resumes. The task is commonly tackled by training <b>supervised</b> models using a sequence labeling approach with BIO tags. However, the reliance on manually annotated data limits the generalizability of such approaches. Moreover, the common BIO setting limits the ability of the models to capture complex skill patterns and handle ambiguous mentions. In this paper, we explore the use of <b>in-context</b> <b>learning</b> to overcome these challenges, on a benchmark of 6 uniformized skill extraction datasets. Our approach leverages the <b>few-shot</b> <b>learning</b> capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to identify and extract skills from sentences. We show that LLMs, despite not being on par with traditional <b>supervised</b> models in terms of performance, can better handle syntactically complex skill mentions in skill extraction tasks.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recently, increasing attention has been focused drawn on to improve the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform complex reasoning. However, previous methods, such as Chain-of-Thought and Self-Consistency, mainly follow Direct <b>Reasoning</b> (DR) frameworks, so they will meet difficulty in solving numerous real-world tasks which can hardly be solved via DR. Therefore, to strengthen the <b>reasoning</b> power of LLMs, this paper proposes a novel Indirect <b>Reasoning</b> (IR) method that employs the logic of contrapositives and contradictions to tackle IR tasks such as factual <b>reasoning</b> and mathematic proof. Specifically, our methodology comprises two steps. Firstly, we leverage the logical equivalence of contrapositive to augment the data and rules to enhance the comprehensibility of LLMs. Secondly, we design a set of <b>prompt</b> templates to trigger LLMs to conduct IR based on proof by contradiction that is logically equivalent to the original DR process. Our IR method is simple yet effective and can be straightforwardly integrated with existing DR methods to further boost the <b>reasoning</b> abilities of LLMs. The experimental results on popular LLMs, such as GPT-3.5-turbo and Gemini-pro, show that our IR method enhances the overall accuracy of factual <b>reasoning</b> by 27.33% and mathematical proof by 31.43%, when compared with traditional DR methods. Moreover, the methods combining IR and DR significantly outperform the methods solely using IR or DR, further demonstrating the effectiveness of our strategy.

**ABSTRACT**  
The advent of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, PaLM, and <b>GPT-4</b> has catalyzed remarkable advances in natural language processing, demonstrating human-like language fluency and <b>reasoning</b> capacities. This position paper introduces the concept of Professional Agents (PAgents), an application framework harnessing <b>LLM</b> capabilities to create autonomous agents with controllable, specialized, interactive, and professional-level competencies. We posit that PAgents can reshape professional services through continuously developed expertise. Our proposed PAgents framework entails a tri-layered architecture for genesis, evolution, and synergy: a base tool layer, a middle agent layer, and a top synergy layer. This paper aims to spur discourse on promising real-world applications of LLMs. We argue the increasing sophistication and integration of PAgents could lead to AI systems exhibiting professional mastery over complex domains, serving critical needs, and potentially achieving artificial general intelligence.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Instruction</b> <b>tuning</b> has unlocked powerful capabilities in large language models (LLMs), effectively using combined datasets to develop generalpurpose chatbots. However, real-world applications often require a specialized suite of skills (e.g., reasoning). The challenge lies in identifying the most relevant data from these extensive datasets to effectively develop specific capabilities, a setting we frame as targeted instruction tuning. We propose LESS, an optimizer-aware and practically efficient algorithm to effectively estimate data influences and perform Low-rank gradiEnt Similarity Search for instruction data selection. Crucially, LESS adapts existing influence formulations to work with the Adam optimizer and variable-length instruction data. LESS first constructs a highly reusable and transferable gradient datastore with low-dimensional gradient features and then selects examples based on their similarity to <b>few-shot</b> examples embodying a specific capability. Experiments show that training on a LESS-selected 5% of the data can often outperform training on the full dataset across diverse downstream tasks. Furthermore, the selected data is highly transferable: smaller models can be leveraged to select useful data for larger models and models from different families. Our qualitative analysis shows that our method goes beyond surface form cues to identify data that exemplifies the necessary <b>reasoning</b> skills for the intended downstream application.

**ABSTRACT**  
Natural Language Processing (NLP) research is increasingly focusing on the use of Large Language Models (LLMs), with some of the most popular ones being either fully or partially closed-source. The lack of access to model details, especially regarding training data, has repeatedly raised concerns about data contamination among researchers. Several attempts have been made to address this issue, but they are limited to anecdotal evidence and trial and error. Additionally, they overlook the problem of \emph{indirect} data leaking, where models are iteratively improved by using data coming from users. In this work, we conduct the first systematic analysis of work using OpenAI's <b>GPT-3.5</b> and GPT-4, the most prominently used LLMs today, in the context of data contamination. By analysing 255 papers and considering OpenAI's data usage policy, we extensively document the amount of data leaked to these models during the first year after the model's release. We report that these models have been globally exposed to $\sim$4.7M samples from 263 benchmarks. At the same time, we document a number of evaluation malpractices emerging in the reviewed papers, such as unfair or missing baseline comparisons and reproducibility issues. We release our results as a collaborative project on https://leak-llm.github.io/, where other researchers can contribute to our efforts.

**ABSTRACT**  
Traditionally, discriminative models have been the predominant choice for tasks like <b>document</b> <b>classification</b> and information extraction. These models make predictions that fall into a limited number of predefined classes, facilitating a binary true or false evaluation and enabling the direct calculation of metrics such as the F1 score. However, recent advancements in generative large language models (GLLMs) have prompted a shift in the field due to their enhanced <b>zero-shot</b> capabilities, which eliminate the need for a downstream dataset and computationally expensive fine-tuning. However, evaluating GLLMs presents a challenge as the binary true or false evaluation used for discriminative models is not applicable to the predictions made by GLLMs. This paper introduces a new metric for generative models called ANLS* for evaluating a wide variety of tasks, including <b>information</b> <b>extraction</b> and classification tasks. The ANLS* metric extends existing ANLS metrics as a drop-in-replacement and is still compatible with previously reported ANLS scores. An evaluation of 7 different datasets and 3 different GLLMs using the ANLS* metric is also provided, demonstrating the importance of the proposed metric. We also benchmark a novel approach to generate prompts for documents, called SFT, against other prompting techniques such as LATIN. In 15 out of 21 cases, SFT outperforms other techniques and improves the state-of-the-art, sometimes by as much as $15$ percentage points.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Reinforcement</b> <b>Learning</b> from Human Feedback (RLHF) is the current dominating framework to <b>fine-tune</b> large language models to better align with human preferences. However, the underlying premise of algorithms developed under this framework can be problematic when user preferences encoded in human feedback are diverse. In this work, we aim to address this problem by developing methods for building personalized language models. We first formally introduce the task of learning from personalized human feedback and explain why vanilla RLHF can be problematic in this context. We then propose a general Personalized-RLHF (P-RLHF) framework, which requires one to jointly learn a user model and a language (or reward) model. The user model takes in user information and outputs user representations. Its structure encodes our assumptions about user preferences underlying the feedback data. We develop new learning objectives for personalized reward modeling and personalized Direct Preference Optimization. To demonstrate the efficacy of our method, we test it on real-world <b>text</b> <b>summarization</b> data with annotated preferences and annotator information. We <b>fine-tune</b> GPT-J 6B to obtain personalized language (and reward) models, which outperform non-personalized models in terms of aligning with individual preferences.

**ABSTRACT**  
Personalization in large language models (LLMs) is increasingly important, aiming to align LLM's interactions, content, and recommendations with individual user preferences. Recent advances in <b>LLM</b> personalization have spotlighted effective <b>prompt</b> design, by enriching user queries with non-parametric knowledge through behavior history retrieval and textual profiles. However, these approaches were limited due to a lack of model ownership, resulting in constrained customization and privacy issues. Moreover, they often failed to accurately capture user behavior patterns, especially in cases where user data were complex and dynamic. To address these shortcomings, we introduce One PEFT Per User (OPPU), which employs personalized parameter-efficient <b>fine-tuning</b> (PEFT) modules, to store user-specific behavior patterns and preferences. By plugging in users' personal PEFT parameters, they can own and use their LLMs personally. OPPU integrates parametric user knowledge in the personal PEFT parameters with the non-parametric knowledge acquired through retrieval and profile. This integration adapts individual LLMs to user behavior shifts. Experimental results demonstrate that OPPU significantly outperforms existing prompt-based methods across seven diverse tasks in the LaMP benchmark. Further in-depth studies reveal OPPU's enhanced capabilities in handling user behavior shifts, modeling users at different active levels, maintaining robustness across various user history formats, and displaying versatility with different PEFT methods.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this study, we focus on two main tasks, the first for detecting legal violations within unstructured textual data, and the second for associating these violations with potentially affected individuals. We constructed two datasets using Large Language Models (LLMs) which were subsequently validated by domain expert annotators. Both tasks were designed specifically for the context of class-action cases. The experimental design incorporated <b>fine-tuning</b> models from the <b>BERT</b> family and open-source LLMs, and conducting <b>few-shot</b> experiments using closed-source LLMs. Our results, with an F1-score of 62.69\% (violation identification) and 81.02\% (associating victims), show that our datasets and setups can be used for both tasks. Finally, we publicly release the datasets and the code used for the experiments in order to advance further research in the area of legal natural language processing (NLP).

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>ChatGPT</b> is notorious for its intransparent behavior. This paper tries to shed light on this, providing an in-depth analysis of the dark personality traits and conspiracy beliefs of <b>GPT-3.5</b> and GPT-4. Different psychological tests and questionnaires were employed, including the Dark Factor Test, the Mach-IV Scale, the Generic Conspiracy Belief Scale, and the Conspiracy Mentality Scale. The responses were analyzed computing average scores, standard deviations, and significance tests to investigate differences between <b>GPT-3.5</b> and GPT-4. For traits that have shown to be interdependent in human studies, correlations were considered. Additionally, system roles corresponding to groups that have shown distinct answering behavior in the corresponding questionnaires were applied to examine the models' ability to reflect characteristics associated with these roles in their responses. Dark personality traits and conspiracy beliefs were not particularly pronounced in either model with little differences between <b>GPT-3.5</b> and GPT-4. However, <b>GPT-4</b> showed a pronounced tendency to believe in information withholding. This is particularly intriguing given that <b>GPT-4</b> is trained on a significantly larger dataset than GPT-3.5. Apparently, in this case an increased data exposure correlates with a greater belief in the control of information. An assignment of extreme political affiliations increased the belief in conspiracy theories. Test sequencing affected the models' responses and the observed correlations, indicating a form of contextual memory.

**ABSTRACT**  
This study introduces a novel teacher-student architecture utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve prostate cancer radiotherapy symptom extraction from clinical notes. Mixtral, the student model, initially extracts symptoms, followed by GPT-4, the teacher model, which refines prompts based on Mixtral's performance. This iterative process involved 294 single symptom clinical notes across 12 symptoms, with up to 16 rounds of refinement per epoch. Results showed significant improvements in extracting symptoms from both single and multi-symptom notes. For 59 single symptom notes, accuracy increased from 0.51 to 0.71, precision from 0.52 to 0.82, recall from 0.52 to 0.72, and F1 score from 0.49 to 0.73. In 375 multi-symptom notes, accuracy rose from 0.24 to 0.43, precision from 0.6 to 0.76, recall from 0.24 to 0.43, and F1 score from 0.20 to 0.44. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of advanced <b>prompt</b> engineering in LLMs for radiation oncology use.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Knowledge</b> <b>distillation</b> (KD) is widely used for compressing a teacher model to a smaller student model, reducing its inference cost and memory footprint while preserving model capabilities. However, current <b>KD</b> methods for auto-regressive sequence models (e.g., large language models) suffer from missing a standardized objective function. Moreover, the recent use of student-generated outputs to address training-inference mismatches has significantly escalated computational costs. To tackle these issues, we introduce DistiLLM, a more effective and efficient <b>KD</b> framework for auto-regressive language models. DistiLLM comprises two components: (1) a novel skew Kullback-Leibler divergence loss, where we unveil and leverage its theoretical properties, and (2) an adaptive off-policy approach designed to enhance the efficiency in utilizing student-generated outputs.

**ABSTRACT**  
Soft <b>Prompt</b> Tuning (SPT) is a parameter-efficient method for adapting pre-trained language models (PLMs) to specific tasks by inserting learnable embeddings, or soft prompts, at the input layer of the PLM, without modifying its parameters. This paper investigates the potential of SPT for cross-lingual transfer. Unlike previous studies on SPT for cross-lingual transfer that often <b>fine-tune</b> both the soft <b>prompt</b> and the model parameters, we adhere to the original intent of SPT by keeping the model parameters frozen and only training the soft prompt. This does not only reduce the computational cost and storage overhead of full-model fine-tuning, but we also demonstrate that this very parameter efficiency intrinsic to SPT can enhance cross-lingual transfer performance to linguistically distant languages. Moreover, we explore how different factors related to the prompt, such as the length or its reparameterization, affect cross-lingual transfer performance.

**ABSTRACT**  
Effective communication between healthcare providers and patients is crucial to providing high-quality patient care. In this work, we investigate how Doctor-written and AI-generated texts in healthcare consultations can be classified using state-of-the-art embeddings and one-shot classification systems. By analyzing embeddings such as bag-of-words, character n-grams, Word2Vec, GloVe, fastText, and GPT2 embeddings, we examine how well our one-shot classification systems capture semantic information within medical consultations. Results show that the embeddings are capable of capturing semantic features from text in a reliable and adaptable manner. Overall, Word2Vec, GloVe and Character n-grams embeddings performed well, indicating their suitability for modeling targeted to this task. GPT2 embedding also shows notable performance, indicating its suitability for models tailored to this task as well. Our machine learning architectures significantly improved the quality of health conversations when training data are scarce, improving communication between patients and healthcare providers.

**ABSTRACT**  
The dominance of social media has added to the channels of bullying for perpetrators. Unfortunately, cyberbullying (CB) is the most prevalent phenomenon in todays cyber world, and is a severe threat to the mental and physical health of citizens. This opens the need to develop a robust system to prevent bullying content from online forums, blogs, and social media platforms to manage the impact in our society. Several machine learning (ML) algorithms have been proposed for this purpose. However, their performances are not consistent due to high class imbalance and generalisation issues. In recent years, large language models (LLMs) like <b>BERT</b> and <b>RoBERTa</b> have achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in several natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Unfortunately, the LLMs have not been applied extensively for CB detection. In our paper, we explored the use of these models for cyberbullying (CB) detection. We have prepared a new dataset (D2) from existing studies (Formspring and Twitter). Our experimental results for dataset D1 and D2 showed that <b>RoBERTa</b> outperformed other models.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recent advancements in natural language processing, especially the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), have opened exciting possibilities for constructing computational simulations designed to replicate human behavior accurately. However, LLMs are complex statistical learners without straightforward deductive rules, making them prone to unexpected behaviors. In this study, we highlight the limitations of LLMs in simulating human interactions, particularly focusing on LLMs' ability to simulate political debates. Our findings indicate a tendency for <b>LLM</b> agents to conform to the model's inherent social biases despite being directed to debate from certain political perspectives. This tendency results in behavioral patterns that seem to deviate from well-established social dynamics among humans. We reinforce these observations using an automatic self-fine-tuning method, which enables us to manipulate the biases within the <b>LLM</b> and demonstrate that agents subsequently align with the altered biases. These results underscore the need for further research to develop methods that help agents overcome these biases, a critical step toward creating more realistic simulations.

**ABSTRACT**  
Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate ever-increasing abilities in mathematical and algorithmic tasks, yet their geometric <b>reasoning</b> skills are underexplored. We investigate LLMs' abilities in constructive geometric problem-solving one of the most fundamental steps in the development of human mathematical reasoning. Our work reveals notable challenges that the state-of-the-art LLMs face in this domain despite many successes in similar areas. LLMs exhibit biases in target variable selection and struggle with 2D spatial relationships, often misrepresenting and hallucinating objects and their placements. To this end, we introduce a framework that formulates an LLMs-based multi-agents system that enhances their existing <b>reasoning</b> potential by conducting an internal dialogue. This work underscores LLMs' current limitations in geometric <b>reasoning</b> and improves geometric <b>reasoning</b> capabilities through self-correction, collaboration, and diverse role specializations.

**ABSTRACT**  
Knowledge hallucination have raised widespread concerns for the security and reliability of deployed LLMs. Previous efforts in detecting hallucinations have been employed at logit-level uncertainty estimation or language-level self-consistency evaluation, where the semantic information is inevitably lost during the token-decoding procedure. Thus, we propose to explore the dense semantic information retained within LLMs' \textbf{IN}ternal \textbf{S}tates for halluc\textbf{I}nation \textbf{DE}tection (\textbf{INSIDE}). In particular, a simple yet effective \textbf{EigenScore} metric is proposed to better evaluate responses' self-consistency, which exploits the eigenvalues of responses' covariance matrix to measure the semantic consistency/diversity in the dense embedding space. Furthermore, from the perspective of self-consistent hallucination detection, a test time feature clipping approach is explored to truncate extreme activations in the internal states, which reduces overconfident generations and potentially benefits the detection of overconfident hallucinations. Extensive experiments and ablation studies are performed on several popular LLMs and question-answering (QA) benchmarks, showing the effectiveness of our proposal.

**ABSTRACT**  
The rise of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the way that we interact with artificial intelligence systems through natural language. However, LLMs often misinterpret user queries because of their uncertain intention, leading to less helpful responses. In natural human interactions, clarification is sought through targeted questioning to uncover obscure information. Thus, in this paper, we introduce LaMAI (Language Model with Active Inquiry), designed to endow LLMs with this same level of interactive engagement. LaMAI leverages <b>active</b> <b>learning</b> techniques to raise the most informative questions, fostering a dynamic bidirectional dialogue. This approach not only narrows the contextual gap but also refines the output of the LLMs, aligning it more closely with user expectations. Our empirical studies, across a variety of complex datasets where LLMs have limited conversational context, demonstrate the effectiveness of LaMAI. The method improves answer accuracy from 31.9% to 50.9%, outperforming other leading question-answering frameworks. Moreover, in scenarios involving human participants, LaMAI consistently generates responses that are superior or comparable to baseline methods in more than 82% of the cases. The applicability of LaMAI is further evidenced by its successful integration with various LLMs, highlighting its potential for the future of interactive language models.

**ABSTRACT**  
Sarcasm Explanation in Dialogue (SED) is a new yet challenging task, which aims to generate a <b>natural</b> <b>language</b> <b>explanation</b> for the given sarcastic dialogue that involves multiple modalities (i.e., utterance, video, and audio). Although existing studies have achieved great success based on the generative pretrained language model BART, they overlook exploiting the sentiments residing in the utterance, video and audio, which are vital clues for sarcasm explanation. In fact, it is non-trivial to incorporate sentiments for boosting SED performance, due to three main challenges: 1) diverse effects of utterance tokens on sentiments; 2) gap between video-audio sentiment signals and the embedding space of BART; and 3) various relations among utterances, utterance sentiments, and video-audio sentiments. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel sEntiment-enhanceD Graph-based multimodal sarcasm Explanation framework, named EDGE. In particular, we first propose a lexicon-guided utterance sentiment inference module, where a heuristic utterance sentiment refinement strategy is devised. We then develop a module named Joint Cross Attention-based Sentiment Inference (JCA-SI) by extending the multimodal <b>sentiment</b> <b>analysis</b> model JCA to derive the joint sentiment label for each video-audio clip. Thereafter, we devise a context-sentiment graph to comprehensively model the semantic relations among the utterances, utterance sentiments, and video-audio sentiments, to facilitate sarcasm explanation generation. Extensive experiments on the publicly released dataset WITS verify the superiority of our model over cutting-edge methods.

**ABSTRACT**  
As Large Language Models make a breakthrough in natural language processing tasks (NLP), multimodal technique becomes extremely popular. However, it has been shown that multimodal NLP are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where the outputs of a model can be dramatically changed by a perturbation to the input. While several defense techniques have been proposed both in computer vision and NLP models, the multimodal robustness of models have not been fully explored. In this paper, we study the adversarial robustness provided by modifying loss function of pre-trained multimodal models, by restricting top K softmax outputs. Based on the evaluation and scoring, our experiments show that after a fine-tuning, adversarial robustness of pre-trained models can be significantly improved, against popular attacks. Further research should be studying, such as output diversity, generalization and the robustness-performance trade-off of this kind of loss functions. Our code will be available after this paper is accepted

**ABSTRACT**  
Large Language Models (LLMs) hold the potential to perform a variety of text processing tasks and provide textual explanations for proposed actions or decisions. In the era of hybrid work, LLMs can provide intelligent decision support for workers who are designing their hybrid work plans. In particular, they can offer suggestions and explanations to workers balancing numerous decision factors, thereby enhancing their work experience. In this paper, we present a decision support model for workspaces in hybrid work environments, leveraging the <b>reasoning</b> skill of LLMs. We first examine LLM's capability of making suitable workspace suggestions. We find that its <b>reasoning</b> extends beyond the guidelines in the <b>prompt</b> and the <b>LLM</b> can manage the trade-off among the available resources in the workspaces. We conduct an extensive user study to understand workers' decision process for workspace choices and evaluate the effectiveness of the system. We observe that a worker's decision could be influenced by the LLM's suggestions and explanations. The participants in our study find the system to be convenient, regardless of whether reasons are provided or not. Our results show that employees can benefit from the LLM-empowered system for their workspace selection in hybrid workplace.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recent advances in machine learning have significantly impacted the field of information extraction, with Large Language Models (LLMs) playing a pivotal role in extracting structured information from unstructured text. This paper explores the challenges and limitations of current methodologies in structured entity extraction and introduces a novel approach to address these issues. We contribute to the field by first introducing and formalizing the task of Structured Entity Extraction (SEE), followed by proposing Approximate Entity Set OverlaP (AESOP) Metric designed to appropriately assess model performance on this task. Later, we propose a new model that harnesses the power of LLMs for enhanced effectiveness and efficiency through decomposing the entire extraction task into multiple stages. Quantitative evaluation and human side-by-side evaluation confirm that our model outperforms baselines, offering promising directions for future advancements in structured entity extraction.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper introduces the Definite Finite Automaton augmented <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>model</b> (DFA-LLM), a novel framework designed to enhance the capabilities of conversational agents using large language models (LLMs). Traditional LLMs face challenges in generating regulated and compliant responses in special scenarios with predetermined response guidelines, like emotional support and customer service. Our framework addresses these challenges by embedding a Definite Finite Automaton (DFA), learned from training dialogues, within the LLM. This structured approach enables the <b>LLM</b> to adhere to a deterministic response pathway, guided by the DFA. The advantages of DFA-LLM include an interpretable structure through human-readable DFA, context-aware retrieval for responses in conversations, and plug-and-play compatibility with existing LLMs. Extensive benchmarks validate DFA-LLM's effectiveness, indicating its potential as a valuable contribution to the conversational agent.

**ABSTRACT**  
We introduce AnyTool, a <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>model</b> agent designed to revolutionize the utilization of a vast array of tools in addressing user queries. We utilize over 16,000 APIs from Rapid API, operating under the assumption that a subset of these APIs could potentially resolve the queries. AnyTool primarily incorporates three elements: an API retriever with a hierarchical structure, a solver aimed at resolving user queries using a selected set of API candidates, and a self-reflection mechanism, which re-activates AnyTool if the initial solution proves impracticable. AnyTool is powered by the function calling feature of GPT-4, eliminating the need for training external modules. We also revisit the evaluation protocol introduced by previous works and identify a limitation in this protocol that leads to an artificially high pass rate. By revising the evaluation protocol to better reflect practical application scenarios, we introduce an additional benchmark, termed AnyToolBench. Experiments across various datasets demonstrate the superiority of our AnyTool over strong baselines such as ToolLLM and a <b>GPT-4</b> variant tailored for tool utilization. For instance, AnyTool outperforms ToolLLM by +35.4% in terms of average pass rate on ToolBench. Code will be available at https://github.com/dyabel/AnyTool.

**ABSTRACT**  
The scarcity of available text corpora for <b>low-resource</b> languages like Albanian is a serious hurdle for research in natural language processing tasks. This paper introduces AlbNews, a collection of 600 topically labeled news headlines and 2600 unlabeled ones in Albanian. The data can be freely used for conducting <b>topic</b> <b>modeling</b> research. We report the initial classification scores of some traditional machine learning classifiers trained with the AlbNews samples. These results show that basic models outrun the ensemble learning ones and can serve as a baseline for future experiments.

**ABSTRACT**  
State-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) are now claiming remarkable supported context lengths of 256k or even more. In contrast, the average context lengths of mainstream benchmarks are insufficient (5k-21k), and they suffer from potential knowledge leakage and inaccurate metrics, resulting in biased evaluation. This paper introduces LV-Eval, a challenging long-context benchmark with five length levels (16k, 32k, 64k, 128k, and 256k) reaching up to 256k words. LV-Eval features two main tasks, single-hop <b>QA</b> and multi-hop QA, comprising 11 bilingual datasets. The design of LV-Eval has incorporated three key techniques, namely confusing facts insertion, keyword and phrase replacement, and keyword-recall-based metric design. The advantages of LV-Eval include controllable evaluation across different context lengths, challenging test instances with confusing facts, mitigated knowledge leakage, and more objective evaluations. We evaluate 10 LLMs on LV-Eval and conduct ablation studies on the techniques used in LV-Eval construction. The results reveal that: (i) Commercial LLMs generally outperform open-source LLMs when evaluated within length levels shorter than their claimed context length. However, their overall performance is surpassed by open-source LLMs with longer context lengths. (ii) Extremely long-context LLMs, such as Yi-6B-200k, exhibit a relatively gentle degradation of performance, but their absolute performances may not necessarily be higher than those of LLMs with shorter context lengths. (iii) LLMs' performances can significantly degrade in the presence of confusing information, especially in the pressure test of "needle in a haystack". (iv) Issues related to knowledge leakage and inaccurate metrics introduce bias in evaluation, and these concerns are alleviated in LV-Eval.

**ABSTRACT**  
Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding is a <b>text</b> <b>generation</b> technique that has been shown to improve the quality of machine translations, but is expensive, even if a sampling-based approximation is used. Besides requiring a large number of sampled sequences, it requires the pairwise calculation of a utility metric, which has quadratic complexity. In this paper, we propose to approximate pairwise metric scores with scores calculated against aggregated reference representations. This changes the complexity of utility estimation from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$, while empirically preserving most of the quality gains of MBR decoding. We release our source code at https://github.com/ZurichNLP/mbr

**ABSTRACT**  
Computation of document similarity is a critical task in various NLP domains that has applications in deduplication, matching, and recommendation. Traditional approaches for document similarity computation include learning representations of documents and employing a similarity or a distance function over the embeddings. However, pairwise similarities and differences are not efficiently captured by individual representations. Graph representations such as Joint Concept Interaction Graph (JCIG) represent a pair of documents as a joint undirected weighted graph. JCIGs facilitate an interpretable representation of document pairs as a graph. However, JCIGs are undirected, and don't consider the sequential flow of sentences in documents. We propose two approaches to model document similarity by representing document pairs as a directed and sparse JCIG that incorporates sequential information. We propose two algorithms inspired by Supergenome Sorting and Hamiltonian Path that replace the undirected edges with directed edges. Our approach also sparsifies the graph to $O(n)$ edges from JCIG's worst case of $O(n^2)$. We show that our sparse directed graph model architecture consisting of a Siamese encoder and <b>GCN</b> achieves comparable results to the baseline on datasets not containing sequential information and beats the baseline by ten points on an instructional documents dataset containing sequential information.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper investigates the language of propaganda and its stylistic features. It presents the PPN dataset, standing for Propagandist Pseudo-News, a multisource, multilingual, multimodal dataset composed of news articles extracted from websites identified as propaganda sources by expert agencies. A limited sample from this set was randomly mixed with papers from the regular French press, and their URL masked, to conduct an annotation-experiment by humans, using 11 distinct labels. The results show that human annotators were able to reliably discriminate between the two types of press across each of the labels. We propose different NLP techniques to identify the cues used by the annotators, and to compare them with machine classification. They include the analyzer VAGO to measure discourse vagueness and subjectivity, a <b>TF-IDF</b> to serve as a baseline, and four different classifiers: two RoBERTa-based models, CATS using syntax, and one XGBoost combining syntactic and semantic features.

**ABSTRACT**  
The Stanceosaurus corpus (Zheng et al., 2022) was designed to provide high-quality, annotated, 5-way stance data extracted from Twitter, suitable for analyzing cross-cultural and cross-lingual misinformation. In the Stanceosaurus 2.0 iteration, we extend this framework to encompass Russian and Spanish. The former is of current significance due to prevalent misinformation amid escalating tensions with the West and the violent incursion into Ukraine. The latter, meanwhile, represents an enormous community that has been largely overlooked on major social media platforms. By incorporating an additional 3,874 Spanish and Russian tweets over 41 misinformation claims, our objective is to support research focused on these issues. To demonstrate the value of this data, we employed <b>zero-shot</b> cross-lingual transfer on multilingual BERT, yielding results on par with the initial Stanceosaurus study with a macro F1 score of 43 for both languages. This underlines the viability of stance classification as an effective tool for identifying multicultural misinformation.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recently, Profile-based Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) has gained increasing attention, which aims to incorporate various types of supplementary profile information (i.e., Knowledge Graph, User Profile, Context Awareness) to eliminate the prevalent ambiguities in user utterances. However, existing approaches can only separately model different profile information, without considering their interrelationships or excluding irrelevant and conflicting information within them. To address the above issues, we introduce a Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network to perform <b>reasoning</b> across multiple Profile information, called Pro-HAN. Specifically, we design three types of edges, denoted as intra-Pro, inter-Pro, and utterance-Pro, to capture interrelationships among multiple Pros. We establish a new state-of-the-art on the ProSLU dataset, with an improvement of approximately 8% across all three metrics. Further analysis experiments also confirm the effectiveness of our method in modeling multi-source profile information.

**ABSTRACT**  
Linear attentions have shown potential for improving <b>Transformer</b> efficiency, reducing attention's quadratic complexity to linear in sequence length. This holds exciting promise for (1) training linear Transformers from scratch, (2) "finetuned-conversion" of task-specific Transformers into linear versions that recover task performance, and (3) "pretrained-conversion" of Transformers such as large language models into linear versions finetunable on downstream tasks. However, linear attentions often underperform standard softmax attention in quality. To close this performance gap, we find prior linear attentions lack key properties of softmax attention tied to good performance: low-entropy (or "spiky") weights and dot-product monotonicity. We further observe surprisingly simple feature maps that retain these properties and match softmax performance, but are inefficient to compute in linear attention. We thus propose Hedgehog, a learnable linear attention that retains the spiky and monotonic properties of softmax attention while maintaining linear complexity. Hedgehog uses simple trainable MLPs to produce attention weights mimicking softmax attention. Experiments show Hedgehog recovers over 99% of standard <b>Transformer</b> quality in train-from-scratch and finetuned-conversion settings, outperforming prior linear attentions up to 6 <b>perplexity</b> points on WikiText-103 with causal GPTs, and up to 8.7 <b>GLUE</b> score points on finetuned bidirectional BERTs. Hedgehog also enables pretrained-conversion. Converting a pretrained <b>GPT-2</b> into a linear attention variant achieves state-of-the-art 16.7 <b>perplexity</b> on WikiText-103 for 125M subquadratic decoder models. We finally turn a pretrained Llama-2 7B into a viable linear attention Llama. With low-rank adaptation, Hedgehog-Llama2 7B achieves 28.1 higher ROUGE-1 points over the base standard attention model, where prior linear attentions lead to 16.5 point drops.

**ABSTRACT**  
Synthetic Electronic Health Records (EHR) have emerged as a pivotal tool in advancing healthcare applications and machine learning models, particularly for researchers without direct access to healthcare data. Although existing methods, like rule-based approaches and generative adversarial networks (GANs), generate synthetic data that resembles real-world EHR data, these methods often use a tabular format, disregarding temporal dependencies in patient histories and limiting data replication. Recently, there has been a growing interest in leveraging Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT) for EHR data. This enables applications like disease progression analysis, population estimation, counterfactual reasoning, and synthetic data generation. In this work, we focus on synthetic data generation and demonstrate the capability of training a <b>GPT</b> model using a particular patient representation derived from CEHR-BERT, enabling us to generate patient sequences that can be seamlessly converted to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) data format.

**ABSTRACT**  
Bayesian optimization (BO) is a powerful approach for optimizing complex and expensive-to-evaluate black-box functions. Its importance is underscored in many applications, notably including hyperparameter tuning, but its efficacy depends on efficiently balancing exploration and exploitation. While there has been substantial progress in BO methods, striking this balance still remains a delicate process. In this light, we present \texttt{LLAMBO}, a novel approach that integrates the capabilities of large language models (LLM) within BO. At a high level, we frame the BO problem in natural language terms, enabling LLMs to iteratively propose promising solutions conditioned on historical evaluations. More specifically, we explore how combining contextual understanding, <b>few-shot</b> <b>learning</b> proficiency, and domain knowledge of LLMs can enhance various components of model-based BO. Our findings illustrate that \texttt{LLAMBO} is effective at <b>zero-shot</b> warmstarting, and improves surrogate modeling and candidate sampling, especially in the early stages of search when observations are sparse. Our approach is performed in context and does not require <b>LLM</b> finetuning. Additionally, it is modular by design, allowing individual components to be integrated into existing BO frameworks, or function cohesively as an end-to-end method. We empirically validate \texttt{LLAMBO}'s efficacy on the problem of hyperparameter tuning, highlighting strong empirical performance across a range of diverse benchmarks, proprietary, and synthetic tasks.

**ABSTRACT**  
We propose <b>fine-tuning</b> large language models for generation of stable materials. While unorthodox, <b>fine-tuning</b> large language models on text-encoded atomistic data is simple to implement yet reliable, with around 90% of sampled structures obeying physical constraints on atom positions and charges. Using energy above hull calculations from both learned ML potentials and gold-standard DFT calculations, we show that our strongest model (fine-tuned LLaMA-2 70B) can generate materials predicted to be metastable at about twice the rate (49% vs 28%) of CDVAE, a competing diffusion model. Because of text prompting's inherent flexibility, our models can simultaneously be used for unconditional generation of stable material, infilling of partial structures and text-conditional generation. Finally, we show that language models' ability to capture key symmetries of crystal structures improves with model scale, suggesting that the biases of pretrained LLMs are surprisingly well-suited for atomistic data.

**ABSTRACT**  
State-space models (SSMs), such as Mamba Gu & Dao (2034), have been proposed as alternatives to <b>Transformer</b> networks in language modeling, by incorporating gating, convolutions, and input-dependent token selection to mitigate the quadratic cost of multi-head attention. Although SSMs exhibit competitive performance, their <b>in-context</b> <b>learning</b> (ICL) capabilities, a remarkable emergent property of modern language models that enables task execution without parameter optimization, remain underexplored compared to Transformers. In this study, we evaluate the <b>ICL</b> performance of SSMs, focusing on Mamba, against <b>Transformer</b> models across various tasks. Our results show that SSMs perform comparably to Transformers in standard regression <b>ICL</b> tasks, while outperforming them in tasks like sparse parity learning. However, SSMs fall short in tasks involving non-standard retrieval functionality. To address these limitations, we introduce a hybrid model, \variant, that combines Mamba with attention blocks, surpassing individual models in tasks where they struggle independently. Our findings suggest that hybrid architectures offer promising avenues for enhancing <b>ICL</b> in language models.

**ABSTRACT**  
During both pretraining and fine-tuning, Large Language Models (\textbf{LLMs}) are trained on trillions of tokens of text of widely varying quality. Both phases of training typically involve heuristically filtering out ``low-quality'' or \textit{noisy} training samples, yet little is known quantitatively about how the type or intensity of noise affects downstream performance. In this work, we study how noise in chain of thought (\textbf{CoT}) impacts task performance in the highly-controlled setting of algorithmically solvable tasks. First, we develop the Traced Integer (\textbf{TInt}) framework to generate highly customizable noised execution traces for any arithmetic function on lists of integers. We then define two types of noise: \textit{static} noise, a local form of noise which is applied after the CoT trace is computed, and \textit{dynamic} noise, a global form of noise which propagates errors in the trace as it is computed. We then evaluate the test performance of pretrained models both prompted and fine-tuned on noised datasets with varying levels of dataset contamination and intensity. We find fine-tuned models are extremely robust to high levels of static noise but struggle significantly more with lower levels of dynamic noise. In contrast, <b>few-shot</b> prompted models appear more sensitive to even static noise. We conclude with a discussion of how our findings impact noise filtering best-practices, in particular emphasizing the importance of removing samples containing destructive dynamic noise with global errors.

**ABSTRACT**  
Pretraining on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has shown great power in facilitating various downstream tasks. As pretraining generally requires huge amount of data and computational resources, the pretrained GNNs are high-value Intellectual Properties (IP) of the legitimate owner. However, adversaries may illegally copy and deploy the pretrained <b>GNN</b> models for their downstream tasks. Though initial efforts have been made to watermark <b>GNN</b> classifiers for IP protection, these methods require the target classification task for watermarking, and thus are not applicable to <b>self-supervised</b> pretraining of <b>GNN</b> models. Hence, in this work, we propose a novel framework named PreGIP to watermark the pretraining of <b>GNN</b> encoder for IP protection while maintain the high-quality of the embedding space. PreGIP incorporates a task-free watermarking loss to watermark the embedding space of pretrained <b>GNN</b> encoder. A finetuning-resistant watermark injection is further deployed. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments show the effectiveness of {\method} in IP protection and maintaining high-performance for downstream tasks.

**ABSTRACT**  
We study the <b>in-context</b> <b>learning</b> dynamics of large language models (LLMs) using three instrumental learning tasks adapted from cognitive psychology. We find that LLMs update their beliefs in an asymmetric manner and learn more from better-than-expected outcomes than from worse-than-expected ones. Furthermore, we show that this effect reverses when learning about counterfactual feedback and disappears when no agency is implied. We corroborate these findings by investigating idealized <b>in-context</b> <b>learning</b> agents derived through meta-reinforcement learning, where we observe similar patterns. Taken together, our results contribute to our understanding of how <b>in-context</b> <b>learning</b> works by highlighting that the framing of a problem significantly influences how learning occurs, a phenomenon also observed in human cognition.

**ABSTRACT**  
Traditional approaches in <b>offline</b> <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning</b> aim to learn the optimal policy that maximizes the cumulative reward, also known as return. However, as applications broaden, it becomes increasingly crucial to train agents that not only maximize the returns, but align the actual return with a specified target return, giving control over the agent's performance. Decision <b>Transformer</b> (DT) optimizes a policy that generates actions conditioned on the target return through <b>supervised</b> <b>learning</b> and is equipped with a mechanism to control the agent using the target return. Despite being designed to align the actual return with the target return, we have empirically identified a discrepancy between the actual return and the target return in DT. In this paper, we propose Return-Aligned Decision <b>Transformer</b> (RADT), designed to effectively align the actual return with the target return. Our model decouples returns from the conventional input sequence, which typically consists of returns, states, and actions, to enhance the relationships between returns and states, as well as returns and actions. Extensive experiments show that RADT reduces the discrepancies between the actual return and the target return of DT-based methods.

**ABSTRACT**  
While graph convolutional networks show great practical promises, the theoretical understanding of their generalization properties as a function of the number of samples is still in its infancy compared to the more broadly studied case of <b>supervised</b> fully connected neural networks. In this article, we predict the performances of a single-layer <b>graph</b> <b>convolutional</b> <b>network</b> (GCN) trained on data produced by attributed stochastic block models (SBMs) in the high-dimensional limit. Previously, only ridge regression on contextual-SBM (CSBM) has been considered in Shi et al. 2022; we generalize the analysis to arbitrary convex loss and regularization for the CSBM and add the analysis for another data model, the neural-prior SBM. We also study the high signal-to-noise ratio limit, detail the convergence rates of the <b>GCN</b> and show that, while consistent, it does not reach the Bayes-optimal rate for any of the considered cases.

**ABSTRACT**  
Masked graph autoencoders have emerged as a powerful graph <b>self-supervised</b> <b>learning</b> method that has yet to be fully explored. In this paper, we unveil that the existing discrete edge masking and binary link reconstruction strategies are insufficient to learn topologically informative representations, from the perspective of message propagation on graph neural networks. These limitations include blocking message flows, vulnerability to over-smoothness, and suboptimal neighborhood discriminability. Inspired by these understandings, we explore non-discrete edge masks, which are sampled from a continuous and dispersive probability distribution instead of the discrete Bernoulli distribution. These masks restrict the amount of output messages for each edge, referred to as "bandwidths". We propose a novel, informative, and effective topological masked graph <b>autoencoder</b> using bandwidth masking and a layer-wise bandwidth prediction objective. We demonstrate its powerful graph topological learning ability both theoretically and empirically. Our proposed framework outperforms representative baselines in both <b>self-supervised</b> link prediction (improving the discrete edge reconstructors by at most 20%) and <b>node</b> <b>classification</b> on numerous datasets, solely with a structure-learning pretext. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/Newiz430/Bandana.

**ABSTRACT**  
Anomaly detection (AD) plays a pivotal role in numerous web-based applications, including malware detection, anti-money laundering, device failure detection, and network fault analysis. Most methods, which rely on <b>unsupervised</b> learning, are hard to reach satisfactory detection accuracy due to the lack of labels. Weakly <b>Supervised</b> Anomaly Detection (WSAD) has been introduced with a limited number of labeled anomaly samples to enhance model performance. Nevertheless, it is still challenging for models, trained on an inadequate amount of labeled data, to generalize to unseen anomalies. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework Knowledge-Data Alignment (KDAlign) to integrate rule knowledge, typically summarized by human experts, to supplement the limited labeled data. Specifically, we transpose these rules into the knowledge space and subsequently recast the incorporation of knowledge as the alignment of knowledge and data. To facilitate this alignment, we employ the Optimal Transport (OT) technique. We then incorporate the OT distance as an additional loss term to the original objective function of WSAD methodologies. Comprehensive experimental results on five real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed KDAlign framework markedly surpasses its state-of-the-art counterparts, achieving superior performance across various anomaly types.

**ABSTRACT**  
Text-attributed graphs (TAGs) present unique challenges for direct processing by Language Learning Models (LLMs), yet their extensive commonsense knowledge and robust <b>reasoning</b> capabilities offer great promise for <b>node</b> <b>classification</b> in TAGs. Prior research in this field has grappled with issues such as over-squashing, heterophily, and ineffective graph information integration, further compounded by inconsistencies in dataset partitioning and underutilization of advanced LLMs. To address these challenges, we introduce Similarity-based Neighbor Selection (SNS). Using SimCSE and advanced neighbor selection techniques, SNS effectively improves the quality of selected neighbors, thereby improving graph representation and alleviating issues like over-squashing and heterophily. Besides, as an inductive and training-free approach, SNS demonstrates superior generalization and scalability over traditional <b>GNN</b> methods. Our comprehensive experiments, adhering to standard dataset partitioning practices, demonstrate that SNS, through simple <b>prompt</b> interactions with LLMs, consistently outperforms vanilla GNNs and achieves state-of-the-art results on datasets like PubMed in node classification, showcasing LLMs' potential in graph structure understanding. Our research further underscores the significance of graph structure integration in <b>LLM</b> applications and identifies key factors for their success in node classification. Code is available at https://github.com/ruili33/SNS.

**ABSTRACT**  
We propose MusicRL, the first music generation system finetuned from human feedback. Appreciation of text-to-music models is particularly subjective since the concept of musicality as well as the specific intention behind a caption are user-dependent (e.g. a caption such as "upbeat work-out music" can map to a retro guitar solo or a techno pop beat). Not only this makes <b>supervised</b> training of such models challenging, but it also calls for integrating continuous human feedback in their post-deployment finetuning. MusicRL is a pretrained autoregressive MusicLM (Agostinelli et al., 2023) model of discrete audio tokens finetuned with <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning</b> to maximise sequence-level rewards. We design reward functions related specifically to text-adherence and audio quality with the help from selected raters, and use those to finetune MusicLM into MusicRL-R. We deploy MusicLM to users and collect a substantial dataset comprising 300,000 pairwise preferences. Using <b>Reinforcement</b> <b>Learning</b> from Human Feedback (RLHF), we train MusicRL-U, the first text-to-music model that incorporates human feedback at scale. Human evaluations show that both MusicRL-R and MusicRL-U are preferred to the baseline. Ultimately, MusicRL-RU combines the two approaches and results in the best model according to human raters. Ablation studies shed light on the musical attributes influencing human preferences, indicating that text adherence and quality only account for a part of it. This underscores the prevalence of subjectivity in musical appreciation and calls for further involvement of human listeners in the finetuning of music generation models.

**ABSTRACT**  
With the emergence of pretrained <b>vision-language</b> models (VLMs), considerable efforts have been devoted to <b>fine-tuning</b> them for downstream tasks. Despite the progress made in designing efficient <b>fine-tuning</b> methods, such methods require access to the model's parameters, which can be challenging as model owners often opt to provide their models as a black box to safeguard model ownership. This paper proposes a \textbf{C}ollabo\textbf{ra}tive \textbf{F}ine-\textbf{T}uning (\textbf{CraFT}) approach for <b>fine-tuning</b> black-box VLMs to downstream tasks, where one only has access to the input prompts and the output predictions of the model. CraFT comprises two modules, a <b>prompt</b> generation module for learning text prompts and a prediction refinement module for enhancing output predictions in residual style. Additionally, we introduce an auxiliary prediction-consistent loss to promote consistent optimization across these modules. These modules are optimized by a novel collaborative training algorithm. Extensive experiments on <b>few-shot</b> classification over 15 datasets demonstrate the superiority of CraFT. The results show that CraFT achieves a decent gain of about 12\% with 16-shot datasets and only 8,000 queries. Moreover, CraFT trains faster and uses only about 1/80 of the memory footprint for deployment, while sacrificing only 1.62\% compared to the white-box method.

**ABSTRACT**  
Availability attacks can prevent the unauthorized use of private data and commercial datasets by generating imperceptible noise and making unlearnable examples before release. Ideally, the obtained unlearnability prevents algorithms from training usable models. When <b>supervised</b> <b>learning</b> (SL) algorithms have failed, a malicious data collector possibly resorts to <b>contrastive</b> <b>learning</b> (CL) algorithms to bypass the protection. Through evaluation, we have found that most of the existing methods are unable to achieve both <b>supervised</b> and contrastive unlearnability, which poses risks to data protection. Different from recent methods based on contrastive error minimization, we employ contrastive-like data augmentations in <b>supervised</b> error minimization or maximization frameworks to obtain attacks effective for both SL and CL. Our proposed AUE and AAP attacks achieve state-of-the-art worst-case unlearnability across SL and CL algorithms with less computation consumption, showcasing prospects in real-world applications.

**ABSTRACT**  
Pretrained large language models (LLMs) exhibit exceptional general language processing capabilities but come with significant demands on memory and computational resources. As a powerful compression technology, binarization can extremely reduce model weights to a mere 1 bit, lowering the expensive computation and memory requirements. However, existing <b>quantization</b> techniques fall short of maintaining <b>LLM</b> performance under ultra-low bit-widths. In response to this challenge, we present BiLLM, a groundbreaking 1-bit post-training <b>quantization</b> scheme tailored for pretrained LLMs. Based on the weight distribution of LLMs, BiLLM first identifies and structurally selects salient weights, and minimizes the compression loss through an effective binary residual approximation strategy. Moreover, considering the bell-shaped distribution of the non-salient weights, we propose an optimal splitting search to group and binarize them accurately. BiLLM achieving for the first time high-accuracy inference (e.g. 8.41 <b>perplexity</b> on LLaMA2-70B) with only 1.08-bit weights across various LLMs families and evaluation metrics, outperforms SOTA <b>quantization</b> methods of <b>LLM</b> by significant margins. Moreover, BiLLM enables the binarization process of the <b>LLM</b> with 7 billion weights within 0.5 hours on a single GPU, demonstrating satisfactory time efficiency.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Offline</b> <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning</b> (RL) has attracted much attention due to its ability in learning from static offline datasets and eliminating the need of interacting with the environment. Nevertheless, the success of offline RL relies heavily on the offline transitions annotated with reward labels. In practice, we often need to hand-craft the reward function, which is sometimes difficult, labor-intensive, or inefficient. To tackle this challenge, we set our focus on the offline imitation learning (IL) setting, and aim at getting a reward function based on the expert data and unlabeled data. To that end, we propose a simple yet effective search-based offline IL method, tagged SEABO. SEABO allocates a larger reward to the transition that is close to its closest neighbor in the expert demonstration, and a smaller reward otherwise, all in an <b>unsupervised</b> <b>learning</b> manner. Experimental results on a variety of D4RL datasets indicate that SEABO can achieve competitive performance to offline RL algorithms with ground-truth rewards, given only a single expert trajectory, and can outperform prior reward learning and offline IL methods across many tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that SEABO also works well if the expert demonstrations contain only observations. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/dmksjfl/SEABO.

**ABSTRACT**  
Explaining stock predictions is generally a difficult task for traditional non-generative deep learning models, where explanations are limited to visualizing the attention weights on important texts. Today, Large Language Models (LLMs) present a solution to this problem, given their known capabilities to generate human-readable explanations for their decision-making process. However, the task of stock prediction remains challenging for LLMs, as it requires the ability to weigh the varying impacts of chaotic social texts on stock prices. The problem gets progressively harder with the introduction of the explanation component, which requires LLMs to explain verbally why certain factors are more important than the others. On the other hand, to <b>fine-tune</b> LLMs for such a task, one would need expert-annotated samples of explanation for every stock movement in the training set, which is expensive and impractical to scale. To tackle these issues, we propose our Summarize-Explain-Predict (SEP) framework, which utilizes a self-reflective agent and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to let a <b>LLM</b> teach itself how to generate explainable stock predictions in a fully autonomous manner. The reflective agent learns how to explain past stock movements through self-reasoning, while the PPO trainer trains the model to generate the most likely explanations from input texts. The training samples for the PPO trainer are also the responses generated during the reflective process, which eliminates the need for human annotators. Using our SEP framework, we <b>fine-tune</b> a <b>LLM</b> that can outperform both traditional deep-learning and <b>LLM</b> methods in prediction accuracy and Matthews correlation coefficient for the stock classification task. To justify the generalization capability of our framework, we further test it on the portfolio construction task, and demonstrate its effectiveness through various portfolio metrics.

**ABSTRACT**  
Network traffic refers to the amount of information being sent and received over the internet or any system that connects computers. Analyzing and understanding network traffic is vital for improving network security and management. However, the analysis of network traffic poses great challenges due to the unique characteristics of data packets, such as heterogeneous headers and encrypted payload lacking semantics. To capture the latent semantics of traffic, a few studies have adopted pre-training techniques based on the <b>Transformer</b> encoder or decoder to learn the representations from large-scale traffic data. However, these methods typically excel only in traffic understanding (classification) or traffic generation tasks. To address this issue, we develop Lens, a foundational network traffic model that leverages the <b>T5</b> architecture to learn the pre-trained representations from large-scale unlabeled data. Harnessing the strength of the encoder-decoder framework, which captures the global information while preserving the generative ability, our model can better learn the representations from large-scale network traffic. To further enhance pre-training performance, we design a novel loss that integrates three distinct tasks, namely Masked Span Prediction (MSP), Packet Order Prediction (POP), and Homologous Traffic Prediction (HTP). Evaluation results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed Lens outperforms the baselines in most downstream tasks related to both traffic understanding and traffic generation. Notably, it also requires considerably less labeled data for <b>fine-tuning</b> compared to current methods.

**ABSTRACT**  
As IoT networks become more complex and generate massive amounts of dynamic data, it is difficult to monitor and detect anomalies using traditional statistical methods and machine learning methods. Deep learning algorithms can process and learn from large amounts of data and can also be trained using <b>unsupervised</b> <b>learning</b> techniques, meaning they don't require labelled data to detect anomalies. This makes it possible to detect new and unknown anomalies that may not have been detected before. Also, deep learning algorithms can be automated and highly scalable; thereby, they can run continuously in the backend and make it achievable to monitor large IoT networks instantly. In this work, we conduct a literature review on the most recent works using deep learning techniques and implement a model using ensemble techniques on the KDD Cup 99 dataset. The experimental results showcase the impressive performance of our deep anomaly detection model, achieving an accuracy of over 98\%.

**ABSTRACT**  
Post-training <b>quantization</b> (PTQ) reduces the memory footprint of LLMs by quantizing their weights to low-precision. In this work, we introduce QuIP#, a weight-only PTQ method that achieves state-of-the-art results in extreme compression regimes ($\le$ 4 bits per weight) using three novel techniques. First, QuIP# improves the incoherence processing from QuIP by using the randomized Hadamard transform, which is faster and has better theoretical properties. Second, QuIP# uses vector <b>quantization</b> techniques to take advantage of the ball-shaped sub-Gaussian distribution that incoherent weights possess: specifically, we introduce a set of hardware-efficient codebooks based on the highly symmetric $E_8$ lattice, which achieves the optimal 8-dimension unit ball packing. Third, QuIP# uses <b>fine-tuning</b> to improve fidelity to the original model. Our experiments show that QuIP# outperforms existing PTQ methods, enables new behaviors in PTQ scaling, and supports fast inference.

**ABSTRACT**  
Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in understanding and generating natural language. However, their capabilities wane in highly specialized domains underrepresented in the pretraining corpus, such as physical and biomedical sciences. This work explores how to repurpose general LLMs into effective task solvers for specialized domains. We introduce a novel, model-agnostic framework for learning custom input tags, which are parameterized as continuous vectors appended to the LLM's embedding layer, to condition the LLM. We design two types of input tags: domain tags are used to delimit specialized representations (e.g., chemical formulas) and provide domain-relevant context; function tags are used to represent specific functions (e.g., predicting molecular properties) and compress function-solving instructions. We develop a three-stage protocol to learn these tags using auxiliary data and domain knowledge. By explicitly disentangling task domains from task functions, our method enables <b>zero-shot</b> generalization to unseen problems through diverse combinations of the input tags. It also boosts LLM's performance in various specialized domains, such as predicting protein or chemical properties and modeling drug-target interactions, outperforming expert models tailored to these tasks.

**ABSTRACT**  
Automated red teaming holds substantial promise for uncovering and mitigating the risks associated with the malicious use of large language models (LLMs), yet the field lacks a standardized evaluation framework to rigorously assess new methods. To address this issue, we introduce HarmBench, a standardized evaluation framework for automated red teaming. We identify several desirable properties previously unaccounted for in red teaming evaluations and systematically design HarmBench to meet these criteria. Using HarmBench, we conduct a large-scale comparison of 18 red teaming methods and 33 target LLMs and defenses, yielding novel insights. We also introduce a highly efficient <b>adversarial</b> <b>training</b> method that greatly enhances <b>LLM</b> robustness across a wide range of attacks, demonstrating how HarmBench enables codevelopment of attacks and defenses. We open source HarmBench at https://github.com/centerforaisafety/HarmBench.

**ABSTRACT**  
Learning in deep weight spaces (DWS), where neural networks process the weights of other neural networks, is an emerging research direction, with applications to 2D and 3D neural fields (INRs, NeRFs), as well as making inferences about other types of neural networks. Unfortunately, weight space models tend to suffer from substantial overfitting. We empirically analyze the reasons for this overfitting and find that a key reason is the lack of diversity in DWS datasets. While a given object can be represented by many different weight configurations, typical INR training sets fail to capture variability across INRs that represent the same object. To address this, we explore strategies for <b>data</b> <b>augmentation</b> in weight spaces and propose a MixUp method adapted for weight spaces. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods in two setups. In classification, they improve performance similarly to having up to 10 times more data. In <b>self-supervised</b> contrastive learning, they yield substantial 5-10% gains in downstream classification.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper presents advanced techniques of training diffusion policies for <b>offline</b> <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning</b> (RL). At the core is a mean-reverting stochastic differential equation (SDE) that transfers a complex action distribution into a standard Gaussian and then samples actions conditioned on the environment state with a corresponding reverse-time SDE, like a typical diffusion policy. We show that such an SDE has a solution that we can use to calculate the log probability of the policy, yielding an entropy regularizer that improves the exploration of offline datasets. To mitigate the impact of inaccurate value functions from <b>out-of-distribution</b> data points, we further propose to learn the lower confidence bound of Q-ensembles for more robust policy improvement. By combining the entropy-regularized diffusion policy with Q-ensembles in offline RL, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on most tasks in D4RL benchmarks.

**ABSTRACT**  
We revisit the classical result of Morris et al.~(AAAI'19) that <b>message-passing</b> graphs neural networks (MPNNs) are equal in their distinguishing power to the Weisfeiler--Leman (WL) isomorphism test. Morris et al.~show their <b>simulation</b> result with ReLU activation function and $O(n)$-dimensional feature vectors, where $n$ is the number of nodes of the graph. Recently, by introducing randomness into the architecture, Aamand et al.~(NeurIPS'22) were able to improve this bound to $O(\log n)$-dimensional feature vectors, although at the expense of guaranteeing perfect <b>simulation</b> only with high probability. In all these constructions, to guarantee equivalence to the WL test, the dimension of feature vectors in the MPNN has to increase with the size of the graphs. However, architectures used in practice have feature vectors of constant dimension. Thus, there is a gap between the guarantees provided by these results and the actual characteristics of architectures used in practice. In this paper we close this gap by showing that, for \emph{any} non-polynomial analytic (like the sigmoid) activation function, to guarantee that MPNNs are equivalent to the WL test, feature vectors of dimension $d=1$ is all we need, independently of the size of the graphs. Our main technical insight is that for simulating multi-sets in the WL-test, it is enough to use linear independence of feature vectors over rationals instead of reals. Countability of the set of rationals together with nice properties of analytic functions allow us to carry out the <b>simulation</b> invariant over the iterations of the WL test without increasing the dimension of the feature vectors.

**ABSTRACT**  
Sparse computation offers a compelling solution for the inference of Large Language Models (LLMs) in <b>low-resource</b> scenarios by dynamically skipping the computation of inactive neurons. While traditional approaches focus on ReLU-based LLMs, leveraging zeros in activation values, we broaden the scope of sparse LLMs beyond zero activation values. We introduce a general method that defines neuron activation through neuron output magnitudes and a tailored magnitude threshold, demonstrating that non-ReLU LLMs also exhibit sparse activation. To find the most efficient activation function for sparse computation, we propose a systematic framework to examine the sparsity of LLMs from three aspects: the trade-off between sparsity and performance, the predictivity of sparsity, and the hardware affinity. We conduct thorough experiments on LLMs utilizing different activation functions, including ReLU, SwiGLU, ReGLU, and ReLU$^2$. The results indicate that models employing ReLU$^2$ excel across all three evaluation aspects, highlighting its potential as an efficient activation function for sparse LLMs. We will release the code to facilitate future research.

**ABSTRACT**  
In <b>reinforcement</b> <b>Learning</b> (RL), an instant reward signal is generated for each action of the agent, such that the agent learns to maximize the cumulative reward to obtain the optimal policy. However, in many real-world applications, the instant reward signals are not obtainable by the agent. Instead, the learner only obtains rewards at the ends of bags, where a bag is defined as a partial sequence of a complete trajectory. In this situation, the learner has to face the significant difficulty of exploring the unknown instant rewards in the bags, which could not be addressed by existing approaches, including those trajectory-based approaches that consider only complete trajectories and ignore the inner reward distributions. To formally study this situation, we introduce a novel RL setting termed <b>Reinforcement</b> <b>Learning</b> from Bagged Rewards (RLBR), where only the bagged rewards of sequences can be obtained. We provide the theoretical study to establish the connection between RLBR and standard RL in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). To effectively explore the reward distributions within the bagged rewards, we propose a Transformer-based reward model, the Reward Bag <b>Transformer</b> (RBT), which uses the <b>self-attention</b> mechanism for interpreting the contextual nuances and temporal dependencies within each bag. Extensive experimental analyses demonstrate the superiority of our method, particularly in its ability to mimic the original MDP's reward distribution, highlighting its proficiency in contextual understanding and adaptability to environmental dynamics.

**ABSTRACT**  
In Federated Learning (FL) paradigm, a parameter server (PS) concurrently communicates with distributed participating clients for model collection, update aggregation, and model distribution over multiple rounds, without touching private data owned by individual clients. FL is appealing in preserving data privacy; yet the communication between the PS and scattered clients can be a severe bottleneck. <b>Model</b> <b>compression</b> algorithms, such as <b>quantization</b> and sparsification, have been suggested but they generally assume a fixed code length, which does not reflect the heterogeneity and variability of model updates. In this paper, through both analysis and experiments, we show strong evidences that variable-length is beneficial for compression in FL. We accordingly present Fed-CVLC (Federated Learning Compression with Variable-Length Codes), which fine-tunes the code length in response of the dynamics of model updates. We develop optimal tuning strategy that minimizes the loss function (equivalent to maximizing the model utility) subject to the budget for communication. We further demonstrate that Fed-CVLC is indeed a general compression design that bridges <b>quantization</b> and sparsification, with greater flexibility. Extensive experiments have been conducted with public datasets to demonstrate that Fed-CVLC remarkably outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, improving model utility by 1.50%-5.44%, or shrinking communication traffic by 16.67%-41.61%.

**ABSTRACT**  
Generating a data set that is representative of the accessible configuration space of a molecular system is crucial for the robustness of machine learned interatomic potentials (MLIP). However, the complexity of molecular systems, characterized by intricate potential energy surfaces (PESs) with numerous local minima and energy barriers, presents a significant challenge. Traditional methods of data generation, such as random sampling or exhaustive exploration, are either intractable or may not capture rare, but highly informative configurations. In this study, we propose a method that leverages uncertainty as the collective variable (CV) to guide the acquisition of chemically-relevant data points, focusing on regions of the configuration space where ML model predictions are most uncertain. This approach employs a Gaussian Mixture Model-based uncertainty metric from a single model as the CV for biased molecular dynamics simulations. The effectiveness of our approach in overcoming energy barriers and exploring unseen energy minima, thereby enhancing the data set in an <b>active</b> <b>learning</b> framework, is demonstrated on the alanine dipeptide benchmark system.

**ABSTRACT**  
We address the problem of learning Granger causality from asynchronous, interdependent, multi-type event sequences. In particular, we are interested in discovering instance-level causal structures in an <b>unsupervised</b> manner. Instance-level causality identifies causal relationships among individual events, providing more fine-grained information for decision-making. Existing work in the literature either requires strong assumptions, such as linearity in the intensity function, or heuristically defined model parameters that do not necessarily meet the requirements of Granger causality. We propose Instance-wise Self-Attentive Hawkes Processes (ISAHP), a novel deep learning framework that can directly infer the Granger causality at the event instance level. ISAHP is the first neural point process model that meets the requirements of Granger causality. It leverages the <b>self-attention</b> mechanism of the <b>transformer</b> to align with the principles of Granger causality. We empirically demonstrate that ISAHP is capable of discovering complex instance-level causal structures that cannot be handled by classical models. We also show that ISAHP achieves state-of-the-art performance in proxy tasks involving type-level causal discovery and instance-level event type prediction.

**ABSTRACT**  
Current clustering priors for deep latent variable models (DLVMs) require defining the number of clusters a-priori and are susceptible to poor initializations. Addressing these deficiencies could greatly benefit deep learning-based scRNA-seq analysis by performing integration and clustering simultaneously. We adapt the VampPrior (Tomczak & Welling, 2018) into a Dirichlet process Gaussian mixture model, resulting in the VampPrior Mixture Model (VMM), a novel prior for DLVMs. We propose an inference procedure that alternates between variational inference and Empirical Bayes to cleanly distinguish variational and prior parameters. Using the VMM in a <b>Variational</b> <b>Autoencoder</b> attains highly competitive clustering performance on benchmark datasets. Augmenting scVI (Lopez et al., 2018), a popular scRNA-seq integration method, with the VMM significantly improves its performance and automatically arranges cells into biologically meaningful clusters.

**ABSTRACT**  
Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) are a very popular class of deep generative model that have been successfully applied to a diverse range of problems including image and video generation, protein and material synthesis, weather forecasting, and neural surrogates of partial differential equations. Despite their ubiquity it is hard to find an introduction to DDPMs which is simple, comprehensive, clean and clear. The compact explanations necessary in research papers are not able to elucidate all of the different design steps taken to formulate the DDPM and the rationale of the steps that are presented is often omitted to save space. Moreover, the expositions are typically presented from the variational lower bound perspective which is unnecessary and arguably harmful as it obfuscates why the method is working and suggests generalisations that do not perform well in practice. On the other hand, perspectives that take the continuous time-limit are beautiful and general, but they have a high barrier-to-entry as they require background knowledge of stochastic differential equations and probability flow. In this note, we <b>distill</b> down the formulation of the DDPM into six simple steps each of which comes with a clear rationale. We assume that the reader is familiar with fundamental topics in machine learning including basic probabilistic modelling, Gaussian distributions, maximum likelihood estimation, and deep learning.

**ABSTRACT**  
The <b>Transformer</b> architecture has shown to be a powerful tool for a wide range of tasks. It is based on the <b>self-attention</b> mechanism, which is an inherently computationally expensive operation with quadratic computational complexity: memory usage and compute time increase quadratically with the length of the input sequences, thus limiting the application of Transformers. In this work, we propose a novel Clustering <b>self-Attention</b> mechanism using Surrogate Tokens (CAST), to optimize the attention computation and achieve efficient transformers. CAST utilizes learnable surrogate tokens to construct a cluster affinity matrix, used to cluster the input sequence and generate novel cluster summaries. The <b>self-attention</b> from within each cluster is then combined with the cluster summaries of other clusters, enabling information flow across the entire input sequence. CAST improves efficiency by reducing the complexity from $O(N^2)$ to $O(\alpha N)$ where N is the sequence length, and {\alpha} is constant according to the number of clusters and samples per cluster. We show that CAST performs better than or comparable to the baseline Transformers on long-range sequence modeling tasks, while also achieving higher results on time and memory efficiency than other efficient transformers.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this paper, we consider a decentralized learning problem in the presence of stragglers. Although gradient coding techniques have been developed for distributed learning to evade stragglers, where the devices send encoded gradients with redundant training data, it is difficult to apply those techniques directly to decentralized learning scenarios. To deal with this problem, we propose a new gossip-based decentralized learning method with gradient coding (GOCO). In the proposed method, to avoid the negative impact of stragglers, the parameter vectors are updated locally using encoded gradients based on the framework of stochastic gradient coding and then averaged in a gossip-based manner. We analyze the convergence performance of GOCO for strongly convex loss functions. And we also provide <b>simulation</b> results to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in terms of learning performance compared with the baseline methods.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Reinforcement</b> <b>learning</b> algorithms need exploration to learn. However, <b>unsupervised</b> exploration prevents the deployment of such algorithms on safety-critical tasks and limits real-world deployment. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm called Ensemble Model Predictive Safety Certification that combines model-based deep <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning</b> with tube-based model predictive control to correct the actions taken by a learning agent, keeping safety constraint violations at a minimum through planning. Our approach aims to reduce the amount of prior knowledge about the actual system by requiring only offline data generated by a safe controller. Our results show that we can achieve significantly fewer constraint violations than comparable <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning</b> methods.

**ABSTRACT**  
Efficient molecular modeling and design are crucial for the discovery and exploration of novel molecules, and the incorporation of deep learning methods has revolutionized this field. In particular, large language models (LLMs) offer a fresh approach to tackle scientific problems from a natural language processing (NLP) perspective, introducing a research paradigm called scientific language modeling (SLM). However, two key issues remain: how to quantify the match between model and data modalities and how to identify the knowledge-learning preferences of models. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-modal benchmark, named ChEBI-20-MM, and perform 1263 experiments to assess the model's compatibility with data modalities and knowledge acquisition. Through the modal transition probability matrix, we provide insights into the most suitable modalities for tasks. Furthermore, we introduce a statistically interpretable approach to discover context-specific knowledge mapping by localized feature filtering. Our pioneering analysis offers an exploration of the learning mechanism and paves the way for advancing SLM in molecular science.

**ABSTRACT**  
The multi-head attention layer is one of the key components of the <b>transformer</b> architecture that sets it apart from traditional feed-forward models. Given a sequence length $k$, attention matrices $\mathbf{\Theta}_1,\ldots,\mathbf{\Theta}_m\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times d}$, and projection matrices $\mathbf{W}_1,\ldots,\mathbf{W}_m\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times d}$, the corresponding multi-head attention layer $F: \mathbb{R}^{k\times d}\to \mathbb{R}^{k\times d}$ transforms length-$k$ sequences of $d$-dimensional tokens $\mathbf{X}\in\mathbb{R}^{k\times d}$ via $F(\mathbf{X}) \triangleq \sum^m_{i=1} \mathrm{softmax}(\mathbf{X}\mathbf{\Theta}_i\mathbf{X}^\top)\mathbf{X}\mathbf{W}_i$. In this work, we initiate the study of provably learning a multi-head attention layer from random examples and give the first nontrivial upper and lower bounds for this problem: - Provided $\{\mathbf{W}_i, \mathbf{\Theta}_i\}$ satisfy certain non-degeneracy conditions, we give a $(dk)^{O(m^3)}$-time algorithm that learns $F$ to small error given random labeled examples drawn uniformly from $\{\pm 1\}^{k\times d}$. - We prove computational lower bounds showing that in the worst case, exponential dependence on $m$ is unavoidable. We focus on Boolean $\mathbf{X}$ to mimic the discrete nature of tokens in large language models, though our techniques naturally extend to standard continuous settings, e.g. Gaussian. Our algorithm, which is centered around using examples to sculpt a convex body containing the unknown parameters, is a significant departure from existing provable algorithms for learning feedforward networks, which predominantly exploit algebraic and rotation invariance properties of the Gaussian distribution. In contrast, our analysis is more flexible as it primarily relies on various upper and lower tail bounds for the input distribution and "slices" thereof.

**ABSTRACT**  
Hypergraph Neural Networks (HGNNs) have recently attracted much attention and exhibited satisfactory performance due to their superiority in high-order correlation modeling. However, it is noticed that the high-order modeling capability of hypergraph also brings increased computation complexity, which hinders its practical industrial deployment. In practice, we find that one key barrier to the efficient deployment of HGNNs is the high-order structural dependencies during inference. In this paper, we propose to bridge the gap between the HGNNs and inference-efficient Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLPs) to eliminate the hypergraph dependency of HGNNs and thus reduce computational complexity as well as improve inference speed. Specifically, we introduce LightHGNN and LightHGNN$^+$ for fast inference with low complexity. LightHGNN directly distills the knowledge from teacher HGNNs to student MLPs via soft labels, and LightHGNN$^+$ further explicitly injects reliable high-order correlations into the student MLPs to achieve topology-aware <b>distillation</b> and resistance to over-smoothing. Experiments on eight hypergraph datasets demonstrate that even without hypergraph dependency, the proposed LightHGNNs can still achieve competitive or even better performance than HGNNs and outperform vanilla MLPs by $16.3$ on average. Extensive experiments on three graph datasets further show the average best performance of our LightHGNNs compared with all other methods. Experiments on synthetic hypergraphs with 5.5w vertices indicate LightHGNNs can run $100\times$ faster than HGNNs, showcasing their ability for latency-sensitive deployments.

**ABSTRACT**  
Random projections or sketches of gradients and Hessian vector products play an essential role in applications where one needs to store many such vectors while retaining accurate information about their relative geometry. Two important scenarios are training data attribution (tracing a model's behavior to the training data), where one needs to store a gradient for each training example, and the study of the spectrum of the Hessian (to analyze the training dynamics), where one needs to store multiple Hessian vector products. While sketches that use dense matrices are easy to implement, they are memory bound and cannot be scaled to modern neural networks. Motivated by work on the intrinsic dimension of neural networks, we propose and study a design space for scalable sketching algorithms. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in three applications: training data attribution, the analysis of the Hessian spectrum and the computation of the intrinsic dimension when <b>fine-tuning</b> pre-trained language models.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recent studies have highlighted the benefits of generating multiple synthetic datasets for <b>supervised</b> learning, from increased accuracy to more effective model selection and uncertainty estimation. These benefits have clear empirical support, but the theoretical understanding of them is currently very light. We seek to increase the theoretical understanding by deriving bias-variance decompositions for several settings of using multiple synthetic datasets. Our theory predicts multiple synthetic datasets to be especially beneficial for high-variance downstream predictors, and yields a simple rule of thumb to select the appropriate number of synthetic datasets in the case of mean-squared error and Brier score. We investigate how our theory works in practice by evaluating the performance of an ensemble over many synthetic datasets for several real datasets and downstream predictors. The results follow our theory, showing that our insights are also practically relevant.

**ABSTRACT**  
Science originates with discovering new causal knowledge from a combination of known facts and observations. Traditional causal discovery approaches mainly rely on high-quality measured variables, usually given by human experts, to find causal relations. However, the causal variables are usually unavailable in a wide range of real-world applications. The rise of large language models (LLMs) that are trained to learn rich knowledge from the massive observations of the world, provides a new opportunity to assist with discovering high-level hidden variables from the raw observational data. Therefore, we introduce COAT: Causal representatiOn AssistanT. COAT incorporates LLMs as a factor proposer that extracts the potential causal factors from unstructured data. Moreover, LLMs can also be instructed to provide additional information used to collect data values (e.g., annotation criteria) and to further parse the raw unstructured data into structured data. The annotated data will be fed to a causal learning module (e.g., the FCI algorithm) that provides both rigorous explanations of the data, as well as useful feedback to further improve the extraction of causal factors by LLMs. We verify the effectiveness of COAT in uncovering the underlying causal system with two case studies of review rating analysis and neuropathic diagnosis.

**ABSTRACT**  
Employee's knowledge is an organization asset. Turnover may impose apparent and hidden costs and irreparable damages. To overcome and mitigate this risk, employee's condition should be monitored. Due to high complexity of analyzing well-being features, employee's turnover predicting can be delegated to machine learning techniques. In this paper, we discuss employee's attrition rate. Three different <b>supervised</b> <b>learning</b> algorithms comprising AdaBoost, SVM and RandomForest are used to benchmark employee attrition accuracy. Attained models can help out at establishing predictive analytics.

**ABSTRACT**  
We introduce MOMENT, a family of open-source foundation models for general-purpose time-series analysis. Pre-training large models on time-series data is challenging due to (1) the absence of a large and cohesive public time-series repository, and (2) diverse time-series characteristics which make multi-dataset training onerous. Additionally, (3) experimental benchmarks to evaluate these models, especially in scenarios with limited resources, time, and supervision, are still in their nascent stages. To address these challenges, we compile a large and diverse collection of public time-series, called the Time-series Pile, and systematically tackle time-series-specific challenges to unlock large-scale multi-dataset pre-training. Finally, we build on recent work to design a benchmark to evaluate time-series foundation models on diverse tasks and datasets in limited supervision settings. Experiments on this benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our pre-trained models with minimal data and task-specific fine-tuning. Finally, we present several interesting empirical observations about large pre-trained time-series models. Our code is available anonymously at anonymous.4open.science/r/BETT-773F/.

**ABSTRACT**  
Precipitation nowcasting based on radar data plays a crucial role in extreme weather prediction and has broad implications for disaster management. Despite progresses have been made based on deep learning, two key challenges of precipitation nowcasting are not well-solved: (i) the modeling of complex precipitation system evolutions with different scales, and (ii) accurate forecasts for extreme precipitation. In this work, we propose CasCast, a cascaded framework composed of a deterministic and a probabilistic part to decouple the predictions for mesoscale precipitation distributions and small-scale patterns. Then, we explore training the cascaded framework at the high resolution and conducting the probabilistic modeling in a low dimensional latent space with a frame-wise-guided diffusion <b>transformer</b> for enhancing the optimization of extreme events while reducing computational costs. Extensive experiments on three benchmark radar precipitation datasets show that CasCast achieves competitive performance. Especially, CasCast significantly surpasses the baseline (up to +91.8%) for regional extreme-precipitation nowcasting.

**ABSTRACT**  
With the arrival of the big data era, mobility profiling has become a viable method of utilizing enormous amounts of mobility data to create an intelligent transportation system. Mobility profiling can extract potential patterns in urban traffic from mobility data and is critical for a variety of traffic-related applications. However, due to the high level of complexity and the huge amount of data, mobility profiling faces huge challenges. Digital Twin (DT) technology paves the way for cost-effective and performance-optimised management by digitally creating a virtual representation of the network to simulate its behaviour. In order to capture the complex spatio-temporal features in traffic scenario, we construct alignment diagrams to assist in completing the spatio-temporal correlation representation and design dilated alignment <b>convolution</b> <b>network</b> (DACN) to learn the fine-grained correlations, i.e., spatio-temporal interactions. We propose a digital twin mobility profiling (DTMP) framework to learn node profiles on a mobility network DT model. Extensive experiments have been conducted upon three real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of DTMP.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recent advances in multi-agent <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning</b> (MARL) have opened up vast application prospects, including swarm control of drones, collaborative manipulation by robotic arms, and multi-target encirclement. However, potential security threats during the MARL deployment need more attention and thorough investigation. Recent researches reveal that an attacker can rapidly exploit the victim's vulnerabilities and generate adversarial policies, leading to the victim's failure in specific tasks. For example, reducing the winning rate of a superhuman-level Go AI to around 20%. They predominantly focus on two-player competitive environments, assuming attackers possess complete global state observation. In this study, we unveil, for the first time, the capability of attackers to generate adversarial policies even when restricted to partial observations of the victims in multi-agent competitive environments. Specifically, we propose a novel black-box attack (SUB-PLAY), which incorporates the concept of constructing multiple subgames to mitigate the impact of partial observability and suggests the sharing of transitions among subpolicies to improve the exploitative ability of attackers. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of SUB-PLAY under three typical partial observability limitations. Visualization results indicate that adversarial policies induce significantly different activations of the victims' policy networks. Furthermore, we evaluate three potential defenses aimed at exploring ways to mitigate security threats posed by adversarial policies, providing constructive recommendations for deploying MARL in competitive environments.

We consider a high-dimensional stochastic contextual linear <b>bandit</b> problem when the parameter vector is $s_{0}$-sparse and the decision maker is subject to privacy constraints under both central and local models of differential privacy. We present PrivateLASSO, a differentially private LASSO <b>bandit</b> algorithm. PrivateLASSO is based on two sub-routines: (i) a sparse hard-thresholding-based privacy mechanism and (ii) an episodic thresholding rule for identifying the support of the parameter $\theta$. We prove minimax private lower bounds and establish privacy and utility guarantees for PrivateLASSO for the central model under standard assumptions.

**ABSTRACT**  
In <b>supervised</b> learning, models are trained to extract correlations from a static dataset. This often leads to models that rely on high-level misconceptions. To prevent such misconceptions, we must necessarily provide additional information beyond the training data. Existing methods incorporate forms of additional instance-level supervision, such as labels for spurious features or additional labeled data from a balanced distribution. Such strategies can become prohibitively costly for large-scale datasets since they require additional annotation at a scale close to the original training data. We hypothesize that targeted natural language feedback about a model's misconceptions is a more efficient form of additional supervision. We introduce Clarify, a novel interface and method for interactively correcting model misconceptions. Through Clarify, users need only provide a short text description to describe a model's consistent failure patterns. Then, in an entirely automated way, we use such descriptions to improve the training process by reweighting the training data or gathering additional targeted data. Our user studies show that non-expert users can successfully describe model misconceptions via Clarify, improving worst-group accuracy by an average of 17.1% in two datasets. Additionally, we use Clarify to find and rectify 31 novel hard subpopulations in the ImageNet dataset, improving minority-split accuracy from 21.1% to 28.7%.

**ABSTRACT**  
Graph generation has been dominated by autoregressive models due to their simplicity and effectiveness, despite their sensitivity to ordering. Yet diffusion models have garnered increasing attention, as they offer comparable performance while being permutation-invariant. Current graph diffusion models generate graphs in a one-shot fashion, but they require extra features and thousands of denoising steps to achieve optimal performance. We introduce PARD, a Permutation-invariant Auto Regressive Diffusion model that integrates diffusion models with autoregressive methods. PARD harnesses the effectiveness and efficiency of the autoregressive model while maintaining permutation invariance without ordering sensitivity. Specifically, we show that contrary to sets, elements in a graph are not entirely unordered and there is a unique partial order for nodes and edges. With this partial order, PARD generates a graph in a block-by-block, autoregressive fashion, where each block's probability is conditionally modeled by a shared diffusion model with an equivariant network. To ensure efficiency while being expressive, we further propose a higher-order graph transformer, which integrates <b>transformer</b> with PPGN. Like GPT, we extend the higher-order graph <b>transformer</b> to support parallel training of all blocks. Without any extra features, PARD achieves state-of-the-art performance on molecular and non-molecular datasets, and scales to large datasets like MOSES containing 1.9M molecules.

**ABSTRACT**  
To handle AI tasks that combine perception and logical reasoning, recent work introduces Neurosymbolic Deep Neural Networks (NS-DNNs), which contain -- in addition to traditional neural layers -- symbolic layers: symbolic expressions (e.g., SAT formulas, logic programs) that are evaluated by symbolic solvers during inference. We identify and formalize an intuitive, high-level principle that can guide the design and analysis of NS-DNNs: symbol correctness, the correctness of the intermediate symbols predicted by the neural layers with respect to a (generally unknown) ground-truth symbolic representation of the input data. We demonstrate that symbol correctness is a necessary property for NS-DNN explainability and <b>transfer</b> <b>learning</b> (despite being in general impossible to train for). Moreover, we show that the framework of symbol correctness provides a precise way to reason and communicate about model behavior at neural-symbolic boundaries, and gives insight into the fundamental tradeoffs faced by NS-DNN training algorithms. In doing so, we both identify significant points of ambiguity in prior work, and provide a framework to support further NS-DNN developments.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this study, we present a transductive inference approach on that reward information propagation graph, which enables the effective estimation of rewards for unlabelled data in offline reinforcement learning. Reward inference is the key to learning effective policies in practical scenarios, while direct environmental interactions are either too costly or unethical and the reward functions are rarely accessible, such as in healthcare and robotics. Our research focuses on developing a reward inference method based on the contextual properties of information propagation on graphs that capitalizes on a constrained number of human reward annotations to infer rewards for unlabelled data. We leverage both the available data and limited reward annotations to construct a reward propagation graph, wherein the edge weights incorporate various influential factors pertaining to the rewards. Subsequently, we employ the constructed graph for transductive reward inference, thereby estimating rewards for unlabelled data. Furthermore, we establish the existence of a fixed point during several iterations of the transductive inference process and demonstrate its at least convergence to a local optimum. Empirical evaluations on locomotion and robotic manipulation tasks validate the effectiveness of our approach. The application of our inferred rewards improves the performance in <b>offline</b> <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning</b> tasks.

**ABSTRACT**  
Ensuring privacy-preserving inference on cryptographically secure data is a well-known computational challenge. To alleviate the bottleneck of costly cryptographic computations in non-linear activations, recent methods have suggested linearizing a targeted portion of these activations in neural networks. This technique results in significantly reduced runtimes with often negligible impacts on accuracy. In this paper, we demonstrate that such computational benefits may lead to increased <b>fairness</b> costs. Specifically, we find that reducing the number of ReLU activations disproportionately decreases the accuracy for minority groups compared to majority groups. To explain these observations, we provide a mathematical interpretation under restricted assumptions about the nature of the decision boundary, while also showing the prevalence of this problem across widely used datasets and architectures. Finally, we show how a simple procedure altering the <b>fine-tuning</b> step for linearized models can serve as an effective mitigation strategy.

**ABSTRACT**  
Memory-based Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (MDGNNs) are a family of dynamic graph neural networks that leverage a memory module to extract, distill, and memorize long-term temporal dependencies, leading to superior performance compared to memory-less counterparts. However, training MDGNNs faces the challenge of handling entangled temporal and structural dependencies, requiring sequential and chronological processing of data sequences to capture accurate temporal patterns. During the batch training, the temporal data points within the same batch will be processed in parallel, while their temporal dependencies are neglected. This issue is referred to as temporal discontinuity and restricts the effective temporal batch size, limiting data parallelism and reducing MDGNNs' flexibility in industrial applications. This paper studies the efficient training of MDGNNs at scale, focusing on the temporal discontinuity in training MDGNNs with large temporal batch sizes. We first conduct a theoretical study on the impact of temporal batch size on the convergence of MDGNN training. Based on the analysis, we propose PRES, an iterative prediction-correction scheme combined with a memory coherence learning objective to mitigate the effect of temporal discontinuity, enabling MDGNNs to be trained with significantly larger temporal batches without sacrificing generalization performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enables up to a 4x larger temporal batch (3.4x speed-up) during MDGNN training.

**ABSTRACT**  
Owing to recent advancements, Large Language Models (LLMs) can now be deployed as agents for increasingly complex decision-making applications in areas including robotics, gaming, and API integration. However, reflecting past experiences in current decision-making processes, an innate human behavior, continues to pose significant challenges. Addressing this, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Planning (RAP) framework, designed to dynamically leverage past experiences corresponding to the current situation and context, thereby enhancing agents' planning capabilities. RAP distinguishes itself by being versatile: it excels in both text-only and multimodal environments, making it suitable for a wide range of tasks. Empirical evaluations demonstrate RAP's effectiveness, where it achieves SOTA performance in textual scenarios and notably enhances multimodal <b>LLM</b> agents' performance for embodied tasks. These results highlight RAP's potential in advancing the functionality and applicability of <b>LLM</b> agents in complex, real-world applications.

**ABSTRACT**  
In domains such as ecological systems, collaborations, and the human brain the variables interact in complex ways. Yet accurately characterizing higher-order variable interactions (HOIs) is a difficult problem that is further exacerbated when the HOIs change across the data. To solve this problem we propose a new method called Local Correlation Explanation (CorEx) to capture HOIs at a local scale by first clustering data points based on their proximity on the data manifold. We then use a multivariate version of the <b>mutual</b> <b>information</b> called the total correlation, to construct a latent factor representation of the data within each cluster to learn the local HOIs. We use Local CorEx to explore HOIs in synthetic and real world data to extract hidden insights about the data structure. Lastly, we demonstrate Local CorEx's suitability to explore and interpret the inner workings of trained neural networks.

**ABSTRACT**  
We study a robust multi-agent multi-armed <b>bandit</b> problem where multiple clients or participants are distributed on a fully decentralized blockchain, with the possibility of some being malicious. The rewards of arms are homogeneous among the clients, following time-invariant stochastic distributions that are revealed to the participants only when the system is secure enough. The system's objective is to efficiently ensure the cumulative rewards gained by the honest participants. To this end and to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to incorporate advanced techniques from blockchains, as well as novel mechanisms, into the system to design optimal strategies for honest participants. This allows various malicious behaviors and the maintenance of participant privacy. More specifically, we randomly select a pool of validators who have access to all participants, design a brand-new consensus mechanism based on digital signatures for these validators, invent a UCB-based strategy that requires less information from participants through secure multi-party computation, and design the chain-participant interaction and an incentive mechanism to encourage participants' participation. Notably, we are the first to prove the theoretical guarantee of the proposed algorithms by regret analyses in the context of optimality in blockchains. Unlike existing work that integrates blockchains with learning problems such as federated learning which mainly focuses on numerical optimality, we demonstrate that the regret of honest participants is upper bounded by $log{T}$. This is consistent with the multi-agent multi-armed <b>bandit</b> problem without malicious participants and the robust multi-agent multi-armed <b>bandit</b> problem with purely Byzantine attacks.

**ABSTRACT**  
Many sequential classification tasks are affected by label noise that varies over time. Such noise can cause label quality to improve, worsen, or periodically change over time. We first propose and formalize temporal label noise, an unstudied problem for sequential classification of time series. In this setting, multiple labels are recorded in sequence while being corrupted by a time-dependent noise function. We first demonstrate the importance of modelling the temporal nature of the label noise function and how existing methods will consistently underperform. We then propose methods that can train <b>noise-tolerant</b> classifiers by estimating the temporal label noise function directly from data. We show that our methods lead to state-of-the-art performance in the presence of diverse temporal label noise functions using real and synthetic data.

**ABSTRACT**  
Machine learning over graphs has recently attracted growing attention due to its ability to analyze and learn complex relations within critical interconnected systems. However, the disparate impact that is amplified by the use of biased graph structures in these algorithms has raised significant concerns for the deployment of them in real-world decision systems. In addition, while synthetic graph generation has become pivotal for privacy and scalability considerations, the impact of generative learning algorithms on the structural bias has not yet been investigated. Motivated by this, this work focuses on the analysis and mitigation of structural bias for both real and synthetic graphs. Specifically, we first theoretically analyze the sources of structural bias that result in disparity for the predictions of dyadic relations. To alleviate the identified bias factors, we design a novel <b>fairness</b> regularizer that offers a versatile use. Faced with the bias amplification in graph generation models that is brought to light in this work, we further propose a fair graph generation framework, FairWire, by leveraging our fair regularizer design in a generative model. Experimental results on real-world networks validate that the proposed tools herein deliver effective structural bias mitigation for both real and synthetic graphs.

**ABSTRACT**  
Resilience against stragglers is a critical element of prediction serving systems, tasked with executing inferences on input data for a pre-trained machine-learning model. In this paper, we propose NeRCC, as a general straggler-resistant framework for approximate coded computing. NeRCC includes three layers: (1) encoding regression and sampling, which generates coded data points, as a combination of original data points, (2) computing, in which a cluster of workers run inference on the coded data points, (3) decoding regression and sampling, which approximately recovers the predictions of the original data points from the available predictions on the coded data points. We argue that the overall objective of the framework reveals an underlying interconnection between two regression models in the encoding and decoding layers. We propose a solution to the nested regressions problem by summarizing their dependence on two regularization terms that are jointly optimized. Our extensive experiments on different datasets and various machine learning models, including LeNet5, RepVGG, and Vision <b>Transformer</b> (ViT), demonstrate that NeRCC accurately approximates the original predictions in a wide range of stragglers, outperforming the state-of-the-art by up to 23%.

**ABSTRACT**  
Collecting large quantities of high-quality data is often prohibitively expensive or impractical, and a crucial bottleneck in machine learning. One may instead augment a small set of $n$ data points from the target distribution with data from more accessible sources like public datasets, data collected under different circumstances, or synthesized by generative models. Blurring distinctions, we refer to such data as `surrogate data'. We define a simple scheme for integrating surrogate data into training and use both theoretical models and empirical studies to explore its behavior. Our main findings are: $(i)$ Integrating surrogate data can significantly reduce the test error on the original distribution; $(ii)$ In order to reap this benefit, it is crucial to use optimally weighted empirical risk minimization; $(iii)$ The test error of models trained on mixtures of real and surrogate data is well described by a scaling law. This can be used to predict the optimal weighting and the gain from surrogate data.

**ABSTRACT**  
The distributional simplicity bias (DSB) posits that neural networks learn low-order moments of the data distribution first, before moving on to higher-order correlations. In this work, we present compelling new evidence for the DSB by showing that networks automatically learn to perform well on maximum-entropy distributions whose low-order statistics match those of the training set early in training, then lose this ability later. We also extend the DSB to discrete domains by proving an equivalence between token $n$-gram frequencies and the moments of embedding vectors, and by finding empirical evidence for the bias in LLMs. Finally we use optimal transport methods to surgically edit the low-order statistics of one class to match those of another, and show that early-training networks treat the edited samples as if they were drawn from the target class.

**ABSTRACT**  
Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have revolutionized a wide range of industries, from healthcare and finance to automotive, by offering unparalleled capabilities in data analysis and decision-making. Despite their transforming impact, DNNs face two critical challenges: the vulnerability to adversarial attacks and the increasing computational costs associated with more complex and larger models. In this paper, we introduce an effective method designed to simultaneously enhance adversarial robustness and execution efficiency. Unlike prior studies that enhance robustness via uniformly injecting noise, we introduce a non-uniform noise injection algorithm, strategically applied at each DNN layer to disrupt adversarial perturbations introduced in attacks. By employing approximation techniques, our approach identifies and protects essential neurons while strategically introducing noise into non-essential neurons. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method successfully enhances both robustness and efficiency across several attack scenarios, model architectures, and datasets.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Reinforcement</b> <b>Learning</b> is a highly active research field with promising advancements. In the field of autonomous driving, however, often very simple scenarios are being examined. Common approaches use non-interpretable control commands as the action space and unstructured reward designs which lack structure. In this work, we introduce Informed Reinforcement Learning, where a structured rulebook is integrated as a knowledge source. We learn trajectories and asses them with a situation-aware reward design, leading to a dynamic reward which allows the agent to learn situations which require controlled traffic rule exceptions. Our method is applicable to arbitrary RL models. We successfully demonstrate high completion rates of complex scenarios with recent model-based agents.

**ABSTRACT**  
In recent years, attention-based transformers have achieved tremendous success across a variety of disciplines including natural languages. A key ingredient behind their success is the generative pretraining procedure, during which these models are trained on a large text corpus in an auto-regressive manner. To shed light on this phenomenon, we propose a new framework that allows both theory and systematic experiments to study the sequential modeling capabilities of transformers through the lens of Markov chains. Inspired by the Markovianity of natural languages, we model the data as a Markovian source and utilize this framework to systematically study the interplay between the data-distributional properties, the <b>transformer</b> architecture, the learnt distribution, and the final model performance. In particular, we theoretically characterize the loss landscape of single-layer transformers and show the existence of global minima and bad local minima contingent upon the specific data characteristics and the <b>transformer</b> architecture. Backed by experiments, we demonstrate that our theoretical findings are in congruence with the empirical results. We further investigate these findings in the broader context of higher order Markov chains and deeper architectures, and outline open problems in this arena.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recent works have shown that by using large pre-trained models along with learnable prompts, rehearsal-free methods for class-incremental learning (CIL) settings can achieve superior performance to prominent rehearsal-based ones. Rehearsal-free CIL methods struggle with distinguishing classes from different tasks, as those are not trained together. In this work we propose a regularization method based on virtual outliers to tighten decision boundaries of the classifier, such that confusion of classes among different tasks is mitigated. Recent prompt-based methods often require a pool of task-specific prompts, in order to prevent overwriting knowledge of previous tasks with that of the new task, leading to extra computation in querying and composing an appropriate <b>prompt</b> from the pool. This additional cost can be eliminated, without sacrificing accuracy, as we reveal in the paper. We illustrate that a simplified prompt-based method can achieve results comparable to previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods equipped with a <b>prompt</b> pool, using much less learnable parameters and lower inference cost. Our regularization method has demonstrated its compatibility with different prompt-based methods, boosting those previous SOTA rehearsal-free CIL methods' accuracy on the ImageNet-R and CIFAR-100 benchmarks.

**ABSTRACT**  
EU directives stipulate a systematic follow-up of train delays. In Sweden, the Swedish Transport Administration registers and assigns an appropriate delay attribution code. However, this delay attribution code is assigned manually, which is a complex task. In this paper, a machine learning-based decision support for assigning delay attribution codes based on event descriptions is investigated. The text is transformed using TF-IDF, and two models, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine, are evaluated against a random uniform classifier and the classification performance of the Swedish Transport Administration. Further, the problem is modeled as both a hierarchical and flat approach. The results indicate that a hierarchical approach performs better than a flat approach. Both approaches perform better than the random uniform classifier but perform worse than the manual classification.

**ABSTRACT**  
Machine learning models, particularly language models, are notoriously difficult to introspect. Black-box models can mask both issues in model training and harmful biases. For <b>human-in-the-loop</b> processes, opaque predictions can drive lack of trust, limiting a model's impact even when it performs effectively. To address these issues, we introduce Retrieve to Explain (R2E). R2E is a retrieval-based language model that prioritizes amongst a pre-defined set of possible answers to a research question based on the evidence in a document corpus, using Shapley values to identify the relative importance of pieces of evidence to the final prediction. R2E can adapt to new evidence without retraining, and incorporate structured data through templating into natural language. We assess on the use case of drug target identification from published scientific literature, where we show that the model outperforms an industry-standard genetics-based approach on predicting clinical trial outcomes.

**ABSTRACT**  
Link prediction with knowledge graphs has been thoroughly studied in graph machine learning, leading to a rich landscape of <b>graph</b> <b>neural</b> <b>network</b> architectures with successful applications. Nonetheless, it remains challenging to transfer the success of these architectures to link prediction with relational hypergraphs. The presence of relational hyperedges makes link prediction a task between $k$ nodes for varying choices of $k$, which is substantially harder than link prediction with knowledge graphs, where every relation is binary ($k=2$). In this paper, we propose two frameworks for link prediction with relational hypergraphs and conduct a thorough analysis of the expressive power of the resulting model architectures via corresponding relational Weisfeiler-Leman algorithms, and also via some natural logical formalisms. Through extensive empirical analysis, we validate the power of the proposed model architectures on various relational hypergraph benchmarks. The resulting model architectures substantially outperform every baseline for inductive link prediction, and lead to state-of-the-art results for transductive link prediction. Our study therefore unlocks applications of graph neural networks to fully relational structures.

**ABSTRACT**  
We introduce a new framework for studying meta-learning methods using PAC-Bayesian theory. Its main advantage over previous work is that it allows for more flexibility in how the transfer of knowledge between tasks is realized. For previous approaches, this could only happen indirectly, by means of learning prior distributions over models. In contrast, the new generalization bounds that we prove express the process of meta-learning much more directly as learning the learning algorithm that should be used for future tasks. The flexibility of our framework makes it suitable to analyze a wide range of meta-learning mechanisms and even design new mechanisms. Other than our theoretical contributions we also show empirically that our framework improves the prediction quality in practical meta-learning mechanisms.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recently, Ainsworth et al. showed that using weight matching (WM) to minimize the $L_2$ distance in a permutation search of model parameters effectively identifies permutations that satisfy linear mode connectivity (LMC), in which the loss along a linear path between two independently trained models with different seeds remains nearly constant. This paper provides a theoretical analysis of LMC using WM, which is crucial for understanding stochastic gradient descent's effectiveness and its application in areas like model merging. We first experimentally and theoretically show that permutations found by WM do not significantly reduce the $L_2$ distance between two models and the occurrence of LMC is not merely due to distance reduction by WM in itself. We then provide theoretical insights showing that permutations can change the directions of the singular vectors, but not the singular values, of the weight matrices in each layer. This finding shows that permutations found by WM mainly align the directions of singular vectors associated with large singular values across models. This alignment brings the singular vectors with large singular values, which determine the model functionality, closer between pre-merged and post-merged models, so that the post-merged model retains functionality similar to the pre-merged models, making it easy to satisfy LMC. Finally, we analyze the difference between WM and straight-through estimator (STE), a dataset-dependent permutation search method, and show that WM outperforms STE, especially when merging three or more models.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Label</b> <b>smoothing</b> loss is a widely adopted technique to mitigate overfitting in deep neural networks. This paper studies <b>label</b> <b>smoothing</b> from the perspective of Neural Collapse (NC), a powerful empirical and theoretical framework which characterizes model behavior during the terminal phase of training. We first show empirically that models trained with <b>label</b> <b>smoothing</b> converge faster to neural collapse solutions and attain a stronger level of neural collapse. Additionally, we show that at the same level of NC1, models under <b>label</b> <b>smoothing</b> loss exhibit intensified NC2. These findings provide valuable insights into the performance benefits and enhanced model calibration under <b>label</b> <b>smoothing</b> loss. We then leverage the unconstrained feature model to derive closed-form solutions for the global minimizers for both loss functions and further demonstrate that models under <b>label</b> <b>smoothing</b> have a lower conditioning number and, therefore, theoretically converge faster. Our study, combining empirical evidence and theoretical results, not only provides nuanced insights into the differences between <b>label</b> <b>smoothing</b> and cross-entropy losses, but also serves as an example of how the powerful neural collapse framework can be used to improve our understanding of DNNs.

**ABSTRACT**  
Deep Learning has revolutionized the field of AI and led to remarkable achievements in applications involving image and text data. Unfortunately, there is inconclusive evidence on the merits of neural networks for structured tabular data. In this paper, we introduce a large-scale empirical study comparing neural networks against gradient-boosted decision trees on tabular data, but also transformer-based architectures against traditional multi-layer perceptrons (MLP) with residual connections. In contrast to prior work, our empirical findings indicate that neural networks are competitive against decision trees. Furthermore, we assess that transformer-based architectures do not outperform simpler variants of traditional MLP architectures on tabular datasets. As a result, this paper helps the research and practitioner communities make informed choices on deploying neural networks on future tabular data applications.

**ABSTRACT**  
Multistep returns, such as $n$-step returns and $\lambda$-returns, are commonly used to improve the sample efficiency of <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning</b> (RL) methods. The variance of the multistep returns becomes the limiting factor in their length; looking too far into the future increases variance and reverses the benefits of multistep learning. In our work, we demonstrate the ability of compound returns -- weighted averages of $n$-step returns -- to reduce variance. We prove for the first time that any compound return with the same contraction modulus as a given $n$-step return has strictly lower variance. We additionally prove that this variance-reduction property improves the finite-sample complexity of temporal-difference learning under linear function approximation. Because general compound returns can be expensive to implement, we introduce two-bootstrap returns which reduce variance while remaining efficient, even when using minibatched experience replay. We conduct experiments showing that two-bootstrap returns can improve the sample efficiency of $n$-step deep RL agents, with little additional computational cost.

**ABSTRACT**  
We investigate how a dot-product attention layer learns a positional attention matrix (with tokens attending to each other based on their respective positions) and a semantic attention matrix (with tokens attending to each other based on their meaning). For an algorithmic task, we experimentally show how the same simple architecture can learn to implement a solution using either the positional or semantic mechanism. On the theoretical side, we study the learning of a non-linear <b>self-attention</b> layer with trainable tied and low-rank query and key matrices. In the asymptotic limit of high-dimensional data and a comparably large number of training samples, we provide a closed-form characterization of the global minimum of the non-convex empirical loss landscape. We show that this minimum corresponds to either a positional or a semantic mechanism and evidence an emergent phase transition from the former to the latter with increasing sample complexity. Finally, we compare the dot-product attention layer to linear positional baseline, and show that it outperforms the latter using the semantic mechanism provided it has access to sufficient data.

**ABSTRACT**  
Outlier generation is a popular technique used for solving important <b>outlier</b> <b>detection</b> tasks. Generating outliers with realistic behavior is challenging. Popular existing methods tend to disregard the 'multiple views' property of outliers in high-dimensional spaces. The only existing method accounting for this property falls short in efficiency and effectiveness. We propose BISECT, a new outlier generation method that creates realistic outliers mimicking said property. To do so, BISECT employs a novel proposition introduced in this article stating how to efficiently generate said realistic outliers. Our method has better guarantees and complexity than the current methodology for recreating 'multiple views'. We use the synthetic outliers generated by BISECT to effectively enhance <b>outlier</b> <b>detection</b> in diverse datasets, for multiple use cases. For instance, oversampling with BISECT reduced the error by up to 3 times when compared with the baselines.

**ABSTRACT**  
Given a collection of probability measures, a practitioner sometimes needs to find an "average" distribution which adequately aggregates reference distributions. A theoretically appealing notion of such an average is the Wasserstein barycenter, which is the primal focus of our work. By building upon the dual formulation of Optimal Transport (OT), we propose a new scalable approach for solving the Wasserstein barycenter problem. Our methodology is based on the recent Neural OT solver: it has bi-level <b>adversarial</b> <b>learning</b> objective and works for general cost functions. These are key advantages of our method, since the typical adversarial algorithms leveraging barycenter tasks utilize tri-level optimization and focus mostly on quadratic cost. We also establish theoretical error bounds for our proposed approach and showcase its applicability and effectiveness on illustrative scenarios and image data setups.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recently, federated learning (FL) has gained momentum because of its capability in preserving data privacy. To conduct model training by FL, multiple clients exchange model updates with a parameter server via Internet. To accelerate the communication speed, it has been explored to deploy a programmable switch (PS) in lieu of the parameter server to coordinate clients. The challenge to deploy the PS in FL lies in its scarce memory space, prohibiting running memory consuming aggregation algorithms on the PS. To overcome this challenge, we propose Federated Learning in-network Aggregation with Compression (FediAC) algorithm, consisting of two phases: client voting and model aggregating. In the former phase, clients report their significant model update indices to the PS to estimate global significant model updates. In the latter phase, clients upload global significant model updates to the PS for aggregation. FediAC consumes much less memory space and communication traffic than existing works because the first phase can guarantee consensus compression across clients. The PS easily aligns model update indices to swiftly complete aggregation in the second phase. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments by using public datasets to demonstrate that FediAC remarkably surpasses the state-of-the-art baselines in terms of model accuracy and communication traffic.

**ABSTRACT**  
Obtaining no-regret guarantees for <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning</b> (RL) in the case of problems with continuous state and/or action spaces is still one of the major open challenges in the field. Recently, a variety of solutions have been proposed, but besides very specific settings, the general problem remains unsolved. In this paper, we introduce a novel structural assumption on the Markov decision processes (MDPs), namely $\nu-$smoothness, that generalizes most of the settings proposed so far (e.g., linear MDPs and Lipschitz MDPs). To face this challenging scenario, we propose two algorithms for regret minimization in $\nu-$smooth MDPs. Both algorithms build upon the idea of constructing an MDP representation through an orthogonal feature map based on Legendre polynomials. The first algorithm, \textsc{Legendre-Eleanor}, archives the no-regret property under weaker assumptions but is computationally inefficient, whereas the second one, \textsc{Legendre-LSVI}, runs in polynomial time, although for a smaller class of problems. After analyzing their regret properties, we compare our results with state-of-the-art ones from RL theory, showing that our algorithms achieve the best guarantees.

**ABSTRACT**  
Decision trees are renowned for their interpretability capability to achieve high predictive performance, especially on tabular data. Traditionally, they are constructed through recursive algorithms, where they partition the data at every node in a tree. However, identifying the best partition is challenging, as decision trees optimized for local segments may not bring global generalization. To address this, we introduce MetaTree, which trains a transformer-based model on filtered outputs from classical algorithms to produce strong decision trees for classification. Specifically, we fit both greedy decision trees and optimized decision trees on a large number of datasets. We then train MetaTree to produce the trees that achieve strong generalization performance. This training enables MetaTree to not only emulate these algorithms, but also to intelligently adapt its strategy according to the context, thereby achieving superior generalization performance.

**ABSTRACT**  
The pretraining-finetuning paradigm has become the prevailing trend in modern deep learning. In this work, we discover an intriguing linear phenomenon in models that are initialized from a common pretrained checkpoint and finetuned on different tasks, termed as Cross-Task Linearity (CTL). Specifically, if we linearly interpolate the weights of two finetuned models, the features in the weight-interpolated model are approximately equal to the linear interpolation of features in two finetuned models at each layer. Such cross-task linearity has not been noted in peer literature. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence supporting that CTL consistently occurs for finetuned models that start from the same pretrained checkpoint. We conjecture that in the pretraining-finetuning paradigm, neural networks essentially function as linear maps, mapping from the parameter space to the feature space. Based on this viewpoint, our study unveils novel insights into explaining model merging/editing, particularly by translating operations from the parameter space to the feature space. Furthermore, we delve deeper into the underlying factors for the emergence of CTL, emphasizing the impact of pretraining.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recent advancements have introduced machine learning frameworks to enhance the Branch and Bound (B\&B) branching policies for solving Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP). These methods, primarily relying on imitation learning of Strong Branching, have shown superior performance. However, collecting expert samples for imitation learning, particularly for Strong Branching, is a time-consuming endeavor. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{C}ontrastive Learning with \textbf{A}ugmented \textbf{M}ILPs for \textbf{Branch}ing (CAMBranch), a framework that generates Augmented MILPs (AMILPs) by applying variable shifting to limited expert data from their original MILPs. This approach enables the acquisition of a considerable number of labeled expert samples. CAMBranch leverages both MILPs and AMILPs for imitation learning and employs <b>contrastive</b> <b>learning</b> to enhance the model's ability to capture MILP features, thereby improving the quality of branching decisions. Experimental results demonstrate that CAMBranch, trained with only 10\% of the complete dataset, exhibits superior performance. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of our method.

**ABSTRACT**  
Probabilistic circuits (PCs) such as sum-product networks efficiently represent large multi-variate probability distributions. They are preferred in practice over other probabilistic representations such as Bayesian and Markov networks because PCs can solve marginal inference (MAR) tasks in time that scales linearly in the size of the network. Unfortunately, the maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) and marginal MAP (MMAP) tasks remain NP-hard in these models. Inspired by the recent work on using neural networks for generating near-optimal solutions to optimization problems such as integer linear programming, we propose an approach that uses neural networks to approximate (M)MAP inference in PCs. The key idea in our approach is to approximate the cost of an assignment to the query variables using a continuous multilinear function, and then use the latter as a loss function. The two main benefits of our new method are that it is <b>self-supervised</b> and after the neural network is learned, it requires only linear time to output a solution. We evaluate our new approach on several benchmark datasets and show that it outperforms three competing linear time approximations, max-product inference, max-marginal inference and sequential estimation, which are used in practice to solve MMAP tasks in PCs.

**ABSTRACT**  
Online controlled experiments are a crucial tool to allow for confident decision-making in technology companies. A North Star metric is defined (such as long-term revenue or user retention), and system variants that statistically significantly improve on this metric in an A/B-test can be considered superior. North Star metrics are typically delayed and insensitive. As a result, the cost of experimentation is high: experiments need to run for a long time, and even then, type-II errors (i.e. false negatives) are prevalent. We propose to tackle this by learning metrics from short-term signals that directly maximise the statistical power they harness with respect to the North Star. We show that existing approaches are prone to overfitting, in that higher average metric sensitivity does not imply improved type-II errors, and propose to instead minimise the $p$-values a metric would have produced on a log of past experiments. We collect such datasets from two social media applications with over 160 million Monthly Active Users each, totalling over 153 A/B-pairs. Empirical results show that we are able to increase statistical power by up to 78% when using our learnt metrics stand-alone, and by up to 210% when used in tandem with the North Star.

**ABSTRACT**  
Most advances in medical image recognition supporting clinical auxiliary diagnosis meet challenges due to the <b>low-resource</b> situation in the medical field, where annotations are highly expensive and professional. This <b>low-resource</b> problem can be alleviated by leveraging the transferable representations of large-scale pre-trained <b>vision-language</b> models via relevant medical text prompts. However, existing pre-trained <b>vision-language</b> models require domain experts to carefully design the medical prompts, which greatly increases the burden on clinicians. To address this problem, we propose a weakly <b>supervised</b> <b>prompt</b> <b>learning</b> method MedPrompt to automatically generate medical prompts, which includes an <b>unsupervised</b> pre-trained <b>vision-language</b> model and a weakly <b>supervised</b> <b>prompt</b> <b>learning</b> model. The <b>unsupervised</b> pre-trained <b>vision-language</b> model utilizes the natural correlation between medical images and corresponding medical texts for pre-training, without any manual annotations. The weakly <b>supervised</b> <b>prompt</b> <b>learning</b> model only utilizes the classes of images in the dataset to guide the learning of the specific class vector in the prompt, while the learning of other context vectors in the <b>prompt</b> requires no manual annotations for guidance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first model to automatically generate medical prompts. With these prompts, the pre-trained <b>vision-language</b> model can be freed from the strong expert dependency of manual annotation and manual <b>prompt</b> design. Experimental results show that the model using our automatically generated prompts outperforms its full-shot learning hand-crafted prompts counterparts with only a minimal number of labeled samples for <b>few-shot</b> learning, and reaches superior or comparable accuracy on <b>zero-shot</b> image classification. The proposed <b>prompt</b> generator is lightweight and therefore can be embedded into any network architecture.

**ABSTRACT**  
Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) has gained popularity for its remarkable <b>zero-shot</b> capacity. Recent research has focused on developing efficient <b>fine-tuning</b> methods, such as <b>prompt</b> <b>learning</b> and adapter, to enhance CLIP's performance in downstream tasks. However, these methods still require additional training time and computational resources, which is undesirable for devices with limited resources. In this paper, we revisit a classical algorithm, Gaussian Discriminant Analysis (GDA), and apply it to the downstream classification of CLIP. Typically, GDA assumes that features of each class follow Gaussian distributions with identical covariance. By leveraging Bayes' formula, the classifier can be expressed in terms of the class means and covariance, which can be estimated from the data without the need for training. To integrate knowledge from both visual and textual modalities, we ensemble it with the original <b>zero-shot</b> classifier within CLIP. Extensive results on 17 datasets validate that our method surpasses or achieves comparable results with state-of-the-art methods on <b>few-shot</b> classification, imbalanced learning, and <b>out-of-distribution</b> generalization. In addition, we extend our method to base-to-new generalization and <b>unsupervised</b> learning, once again demonstrating its superiority over competing approaches.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recent advancements in large language models have sparked interest in their extraordinary and near-superhuman capabilities, leading researchers to explore methods for evaluating and optimizing these abilities, which is called superalignment. In this context, our paper delves into the realm of vision foundation models, focusing on the concept of weak-to-strong generalization, which involves using a weaker model to supervise a stronger one, aiming to enhance the latter's capabilities beyond the former's limits. We introduce a novel and adaptively adjustable loss function for weak-to-strong supervision. Our comprehensive experiments span various scenarios, including <b>few-shot</b> learning, transfer learning, noisy label learning, and common <b>knowledge</b> <b>distillation</b> settings. The results are striking: our approach not only exceeds the performance benchmarks set by strong-to-strong generalization but also surpasses the outcomes of <b>fine-tuning</b> strong models with whole datasets. This compelling evidence underscores the significant potential of weak-to-strong generalization, showcasing its capability to substantially elevate the performance of vision foundation models. The code is available at https://github.com/ggjy/vision_weak_to_strong.

**ABSTRACT**  
Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image generation tasks, yet their practical deployment is restrained by the high memory and time consumption. While <b>quantization</b> paves a way for diffusion <b>model</b> <b>compression</b> and acceleration, existing methods totally fail when the models are quantized to low-bits. In this paper, we unravel three properties in quantized diffusion models that compromise the efficacy of current methods: imbalanced activation distributions, imprecise temporal information, and vulnerability to perturbations of specific modules. To alleviate the intensified low-bit <b>quantization</b> difficulty <b>stemming</b> from the distribution imbalance, we propose finetuning the quantized model to better adapt to the activation distribution. Building on this idea, we identify two critical types of quantized layers: those holding vital temporal information and those sensitive to reduced bit-width, and finetune them to mitigate performance degradation with efficiency. We empirically verify that our approach modifies the activation distribution and provides meaningful temporal information, facilitating easier and more accurate quantization. Our method is evaluated over three high-resolution image generation tasks and achieves state-of-the-art performance under various bit-width settings, as well as being the first method to generate readable images on full 4-bit (i.e. W4A4) Stable Diffusion.

**ABSTRACT**  
Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable problem-solving capabilities in various vision fields (e.g., generic object recognition and grounding) based on strong visual semantic representation and language <b>reasoning</b> ability. However, whether MLLMs are sensitive to subtle visual spoof/forged clues and how they perform in the domain of face attack detection (e.g., face spoofing and forgery detection) is still unexplored. In this paper, we introduce a new benchmark, namely SHIELD, to evaluate the ability of MLLMs on face spoofing and forgery detection. Specifically, we design true/false and multiple-choice questions to evaluate multimodal face data in these two face security tasks. For the face anti-spoofing task, we evaluate three different modalities (i.e., RGB, infrared, depth) under four types of presentation attacks (i.e., print attack, replay attack, rigid mask, paper mask). For the face forgery detection task, we evaluate GAN-based and diffusion-based data with both visual and acoustic modalities. Each question is subjected to both <b>zero-shot</b> and <b>few-shot</b> tests under standard and chain of thought (COT) settings. The results indicate that MLLMs hold substantial potential in the face security domain, offering advantages over traditional specific models in terms of interpretability, multimodal flexible reasoning, and joint face spoof and forgery detection. Additionally, we develop a novel Multi-Attribute Chain of Thought (MA-COT) paradigm for describing and judging various task-specific and task-irrelevant attributes of face images, which provides rich task-related knowledge for subtle spoof/forged clue mining. Extensive experiments in separate face anti-spoofing, separate face forgery detection, and joint detection tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MA-COT.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Visual</b> <b>Question</b> <b>Answering</b> (VQA) is a challenging task of predicting the answer to a question about the content of an image. It requires deep understanding of both the textual question and visual image. Prior works directly evaluate the answering models by simply calculating the accuracy of the predicted answers. However, the inner <b>reasoning</b> behind the prediction is disregarded in such a "black box" system, and we do not even know if one can trust the predictions. In some cases, the models still get the correct answers even when they focus on irrelevant visual regions or textual tokens, which makes the models unreliable and illogical. To generate both visual and textual rationales next to the predicted answer to the given image/question pair, we propose Convincing Rationales for VQA, CRVQA. Considering the extra annotations brought by the new outputs, {CRVQA} is trained and evaluated by samples converted from some existing <b>VQA</b> datasets and their visual labels. The extensive experiments demonstrate that the visual and textual rationales support the prediction of the answers, and further improve the accuracy. Furthermore, {CRVQA} achieves competitive performance on generic <b>VQA</b> datatsets in the <b>zero-shot</b> evaluation setting. The dataset and source code will be released under https://github.com/lik1996/CRVQA2024.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recent advancements in large language models have influenced the development of video large multimodal models (VLMMs). The previous approaches for VLMMs involved <b>Supervised</b> <b>Fine-Tuning</b> (SFT) with instruction-tuned datasets, integrating <b>LLM</b> with visual encoders, and adding additional learnable modules. Video and text multimodal alignment remains challenging, primarily due to the deficient volume and quality of multimodal instruction-tune data compared to text-only data. We present a novel alignment strategy that employs multimodal AI system to oversee itself called <b>Reinforcement</b> <b>Learning</b> from AI Feedback (RLAIF), providing self-preference feedback to refine itself and facilitating the alignment of video and text modalities. In specific, we propose context-aware reward modeling by providing detailed video descriptions as context during the generation of preference feedback in order to enrich the understanding of video content. Demonstrating enhanced performance across diverse video benchmarks, our multimodal RLAIF approach, VLM-RLAIF, outperforms existing approaches, including the SFT model. We commit to open-sourcing our code, models, and datasets to foster further research in this area.

**ABSTRACT**  
Domain generalization (DG) is an important problem that learns a model that can generalize to unseen test domains leveraging one or more source domains, under the assumption of shared label spaces. However, most DG methods assume access to abundant source data in the target label space, a requirement that proves overly stringent for numerous real-world applications, where acquiring the same label space as the target task is prohibitively expensive. For this setting, we tackle the multimodal version of the <b>unsupervised</b> domain generalization (UDG) problem, which uses a large task-agnostic unlabeled source dataset, such as LAION-2B during finetuning. Our framework does not explicitly assume any relationship between the source dataset and target task. Instead, it relies only on the premise that the source dataset can be efficiently searched in a joint <b>vision-language</b> space. For this multimodal UDG setting, we propose a novel method to build a small ($<$100K) subset of the source data in three simple steps: (1) diversified retrieval using label names as queries, (2) rank pseudo-labeling, and (3) clustering to find representative samples. To demonstrate the value of studying the multimodal UDG problem, we compare our results against state-of-the-art source-free DG and <b>zero-shot</b> (ZS) methods on their respective benchmarks and show up to 10% improvement in accuracy on 20 diverse target datasets. Additionally, our multi-stage dataset construction method achieves 3% improvement on average over nearest neighbors retrieval. Code is available: https://github.com/Chris210634/mudg

**ABSTRACT**  
Large language models (LLMs) have recently experienced remarkable progress, where the advent of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) has endowed LLMs with visual capabilities, leading to impressive performances in various multi-modal tasks. However, those powerful MLLMs such as GPT-4V still fail spectacularly when presented with certain image and text inputs. In this paper, we identify a typical class of inputs that baffles MLLMs, which consist of images that are highly relevant but inconsistent with answers, causing MLLMs to suffer from hallucination. To quantify the effect, we propose CorrelationQA, the first benchmark that assesses the hallucination level given spurious images. This benchmark contains 7,308 <b>text-image</b> pairs across 13 categories. Based on the proposed CorrelationQA, we conduct a thorough analysis on 9 mainstream MLLMs, illustrating that they universally suffer from this instinctive bias to varying degrees. We hope that our curated benchmark and evaluation results aid in better assessments of the MLLMs' robustness in the presence of misleading images.

**ABSTRACT**  
Can a lightweight Vision <b>Transformer</b> (ViT) match or exceed the performance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) like ResNet on small datasets with small image resolutions? This report demonstrates that a pure ViT can indeed achieve superior performance through pre-training, using a masked auto-encoder technique with minimal image scaling. Our experiments on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets involved ViT models with fewer than 3.65 million parameters and a multiply-accumulate (MAC) count below 0.27G, qualifying them as 'lightweight' models. Unlike previous approaches, our method attains state-of-the-art performance among similar lightweight transformer-based architectures without significantly scaling up images from CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. This achievement underscores the efficiency of our model, not only in handling small datasets but also in effectively processing images close to their original scale.

**ABSTRACT**  
Scaling up contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP) is critical for empowering both vision and multimodal models. We present EVA-CLIP-18B, the largest and most powerful open-source CLIP model to date, with 18-billion parameters. With only 6-billion training samples seen, EVA-CLIP-18B achieves an exceptional 80.7% <b>zero-shot</b> top-1 accuracy averaged across 27 widely recognized image classification benchmarks, outperforming its forerunner EVA-CLIP (5-billion parameters) and other open-source CLIP models by a large margin. Remarkably, we observe a consistent performance improvement with the model size scaling of EVA-CLIP, despite maintaining a constant training dataset of 2-billion <b>image-text</b> pairs from LAION-2B and COYO-700M. This dataset is openly available and much smaller than the in-house datasets (e.g., DFN-5B, WebLI-10B) employed in other state-of-the-art CLIP models. EVA-CLIP-18B demonstrates the potential of EVA-style weak-to-strong visual model scaling. With our model weights made publicly available, we hope to facilitate future research in vision and multimodal foundation models.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Vision-Language</b> Models (VLMs) have demonstrated their widespread viability thanks to extensive training in aligning visual instructions to answers. However, this conclusive alignment leads models to ignore critical visual reasoning, and further result in failures on meticulous visual problems and unfaithful responses. In this paper, we propose Chain of Manipulations, a mechanism that enables VLMs to solve problems with a series of manipulations, where each manipulation refers to an operation on the visual input, either from intrinsic abilities (e.g., grounding) acquired through prior training or from imitating human-like behaviors (e.g., zoom in). This mechanism encourages VLMs to generate faithful responses with evidential visual reasoning, and permits users to trace error causes in the interpretable paths. We thus train CogCoM, a general 17B VLM with a memory-based compatible architecture endowed this <b>reasoning</b> mechanism. Experiments show that our model achieves the state-of-the-art performance across 8 benchmarks from 3 categories, and a limited number of training steps with the data swiftly gains a competitive performance. The code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/THUDM/CogCoM.

**ABSTRACT**  
In finetuning a large pretrained model to downstream tasks, parameter-efficient <b>fine-tuning</b> (PEFT) methods can effectively finetune pretrained models with few trainable parameters, but suffer from high GPU memory consumption and slow training speed. Because learnable parameters from these methods are entangled with the pretrained model, gradients related to the frozen pretrained model's parameters have to be computed and stored during finetuning. We propose Low-rank Attention Side-Tuning (LAST), which disentangles the trainable module from the pretrained model by freezing not only parameters but also outputs of the pretrained network. LAST trains a side-network composed of only low-rank <b>self-attention</b> modules. By viewing the pretrained model as a frozen feature extractor, the side-network takes intermediate output from the pretrained model and focus on learning task-specific knowledge. We also show that LAST can be highly parallel across multiple optimization objectives, making it very efficient in downstream task adaptation, for example, in finding optimal hyperparameters. LAST outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on VTAB-1K and other visual adaptation tasks with roughly only 30\% of GPU memory footprint and 60\% of training time compared to existing PEFT methods, but achieves significantly higher accuracy.

**ABSTRACT**  
Intelligent vehicles of the future must be capable of understanding and navigating safely through their surroundings. Camera-based vehicle systems can use keypoints as well as objects as low- and high-level landmarks for GNSS-independent SLAM and visual odometry. To this end we propose YOLOPoint, a <b>convolutional</b> <b>neural</b> <b>network</b> model that simultaneously detects keypoints and objects in an image by combining YOLOv5 and SuperPoint to create a single forward-pass network that is both real-time capable and accurate. By using a shared backbone and a light-weight network structure, YOLOPoint is able to perform competitively on both the HPatches and KITTI benchmarks.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recent endeavors have been made to leverage <b>self-supervised</b> depth estimation as guidance in <b>unsupervised</b> <b>domain</b> <b>adaptation</b> (UDA) for semantic segmentation. Prior arts, however, overlook the discrepancy between semantic and depth features, as well as the reliability of feature fusion, thus leading to suboptimal segmentation performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel UDA framework called SMART (croSs doMain semAntic segmentation based on eneRgy esTimation) that utilizes Energy-Based Models (EBMs) to obtain task-adaptive features and achieve reliable feature fusion for semantic segmentation with <b>self-supervised</b> depth estimates. Our framework incorporates two novel components: energy-based feature fusion (EB2F) and energy-based reliable fusion Assessment (RFA) modules. The EB2F module produces task-adaptive semantic and depth features by explicitly measuring and reducing their discrepancy using Hopfield energy for better feature fusion. The RFA module evaluates the reliability of the feature fusion using an energy score to improve the effectiveness of depth guidance. Extensive experiments on two datasets demonstrate that our method achieves significant performance gains over prior works, validating the effectiveness of our energy-based learning approach.

**ABSTRACT**  
The recent Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated remarkable <b>zero-shot</b> capability and flexible geometric prompting in general image segmentation. However, SAM often struggles when handling various unconventional images, such as aerial, medical, and non-RGB images. This paper presents CAT-SAM, a ConditionAl Tuning network that adapts SAM toward various unconventional target tasks with just <b>few-shot</b> target samples. CAT-SAM freezes the entire SAM and adapts its mask decoder and image encoder simultaneously with a small number of learnable parameters. The core design is a <b>prompt</b> bridge structure that enables decoder-conditioned joint tuning of the heavyweight image encoder and the lightweight mask decoder. The bridging maps the <b>prompt</b> token of the mask decoder to the image encoder, fostering synergic adaptation of the encoder and the decoder with mutual benefits. We develop two representative tuning strategies for the image encoder which leads to two CAT-SAM variants: one injecting learnable <b>prompt</b> tokens in the input space and the other inserting lightweight adapter networks. Extensive experiments over 11 unconventional tasks show that both CAT-SAM variants achieve superior target segmentation performance consistently even under the very challenging one-shot adaptation setup.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this work, we focused on deep learning image processing in the context of oral rare diseases, which pose challenges due to limited data availability. A crucial step involves teeth detection, segmentation and numbering in panoramic radiographs. To this end, we used a dataset consisting of 156 panoramic radiographs from individuals with rare oral diseases and labeled by experts. We trained the Detection <b>Transformer</b> (DETR) neural network for teeth detection, segmentation, and numbering the 52 teeth classes. In addition, we used <b>data</b> <b>augmentation</b> techniques, including geometric transformations. Finally, we generated new panoramic images using inpainting techniques with stable diffusion, by removing teeth from a panoramic radiograph and integrating teeth into it. The results showed a mAP exceeding 0,69 for DETR without data augmentation. The mAP was improved to 0,82 when <b>data</b> <b>augmentation</b> techniques are used. Furthermore, we observed promising performances when using new panoramic radiographs generated with inpainting technique, with mAP of 0,76.

**ABSTRACT**  
Currently, <b>Transformer</b> is the most popular architecture for image dehazing, but due to its large computational complexity, its ability to handle long-range dependency is limited on resource-constrained devices. To tackle this challenge, we introduce the U-shaped Vision Mamba (UVM-Net), an efficient single-image dehazing network. Inspired by the State Space Sequence Models (SSMs), a new deep sequence model known for its power to handle long sequences, we design a Bi-SSM block that integrates the local feature extraction ability of the convolutional layer with the ability of the SSM to capture long-range dependencies. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Our method provides a more highly efficient idea of long-range dependency modeling for image dehazing as well as other image restoration tasks. The URL of the code is \url{https://github.com/zzr-idam/UVM-Net}. Our method takes only \textbf{0.009} seconds to infer a $325 \times 325$ resolution image (100FPS) without I/O handling time.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this paper, we introduce the Volumetric Relightable Morphable Model (VRMM), a novel volumetric and parametric facial prior for 3D face modeling. While recent volumetric prior models offer improvements over traditional methods like 3D Morphable Models (3DMMs), they face challenges in model learning and personalized reconstructions. Our VRMM overcomes these by employing a novel training framework that efficiently disentangles and encodes latent spaces of identity, expression, and lighting into low-dimensional representations. This framework, designed with <b>self-supervised</b> learning, significantly reduces the constraints for training data, making it more feasible in practice. The learned VRMM offers relighting capabilities and encompasses a comprehensive range of expressions. We demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of VRMM through various applications like avatar generation, facial reconstruction, and animation. Additionally, we address the common issue of overfitting in generative volumetric models with a novel prior-preserving personalization framework based on VRMM. Such an approach enables accurate 3D face reconstruction from even a single portrait input. Our experiments showcase the potential of VRMM to significantly enhance the field of 3D face modeling.

**ABSTRACT**  
Adversarial examples generated by a surrogate model typically exhibit limited transferability to unknown target systems. To address this problem, many transferability enhancement approaches (e.g., input transformation and model augmentation) have been proposed. However, they show poor performances in attacking systems having different model genera from the surrogate model. In this paper, we propose a novel and generic attacking strategy, called Deformation-Constrained Warping Attack (DeCoWA), that can be effectively applied to cross model genus attack. Specifically, DeCoWA firstly augments input examples via an elastic deformation, namely Deformation-Constrained Warping (DeCoW), to obtain rich local details of the augmented input. To avoid severe distortion of global semantics led by random deformation, DeCoW further constrains the strength and direction of the warping transformation by a novel adaptive control strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the transferable examples crafted by our DeCoWA on <b>CNN</b> surrogates can significantly hinder the performance of Transformers (and vice versa) on various tasks, including image classification, video action recognition, and audio recognition. Code is made available at https://github.com/LinQinLiang/DeCoWA.

**ABSTRACT**  
The growth of <b>generative</b> <b>adversarial</b> <b>network</b> (GAN) models has increased the ability of image processing and provides numerous industries with the technology to produce realistic image transformations. However, with the field being recently established there are new evaluation metrics that can further this research. Previous research has shown the Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) to be an effective metric when testing these image-to-image GANs in real-world applications. Signed Inception Distance (SID), a founded metric in 2023, expands on FID by allowing unsigned distances. This paper uses public datasets that consist of fa\c{c}ades, cityscapes, and maps within Pix2Pix and CycleGAN models. After training these models are evaluated on both inception distance metrics which measure the generating performance of the trained models.

**ABSTRACT**  
The diverse agents in multi-agent perception systems may be from different companies. Each company might use the identical classic neural network architecture based encoder for feature extraction. However, the data source to train the various agents is independent and private in each company, leading to the Distribution Gap of different private data for training distinct agents in multi-agent perception system. The data silos by the above Distribution Gap could result in a significant performance decline in multi-agent perception. In this paper, we thoroughly examine the impact of the distribution gap on existing multi-agent perception systems. To break the data silos, we introduce the Feature Distribution-aware Aggregation (FDA) framework for cross-domain learning to mitigate the above Distribution Gap in multi-agent perception. FDA comprises two key components: Learnable Feature Compensation Module and Distribution-aware Statistical Consistency Module, both aimed at enhancing intermediate features to minimize the distribution gap among multi-agent features. Intensive experiments on the public OPV2V and V2XSet datasets underscore FDA's effectiveness in point cloud-based 3D object detection, presenting it as an invaluable augmentation to existing multi-agent perception systems.

**ABSTRACT**  
Image-to-video (I2V) generation aims to use the initial frame (alongside a text prompt) to create a video sequence. A grand challenge in I2V generation is to maintain visual consistency throughout the video: existing methods often struggle to preserve the integrity of the subject, background, and style from the first frame, as well as ensure a fluid and logical progression within the video narrative. To mitigate these issues, we propose ConsistI2V, a diffusion-based method to enhance visual consistency for I2V generation. Specifically, we introduce (1) spatiotemporal attention over the first frame to maintain spatial and motion consistency, (2) noise initialization from the low-frequency band of the first frame to enhance layout consistency. These two approaches enable ConsistI2V to generate highly consistent videos. We also extend the proposed approaches to show their potential to improve consistency in auto-regressive long video generation and camera motion control. To verify the effectiveness of our method, we propose I2V-Bench, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark for I2V generation. Our automatic and human evaluation results demonstrate the superiority of ConsistI2V over existing methods.

**ABSTRACT**  
The ability of deep image prior (DIP) to recover high-quality images from incomplete or corrupted measurements has made it popular in inverse problems in image restoration and medical imaging including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, conventional DIP suffers from severe overfitting and spectral bias effects. In this work, we first provide an analysis of how DIP recovers information from undersampled imaging measurements by analyzing the training dynamics of the underlying networks in the kernel regime for different architectures. This study sheds light on important underlying properties for DIP-based recovery. Current research suggests that incorporating a reference image as network input can enhance DIP's performance in image reconstruction compared to using random inputs. However, obtaining suitable reference images requires supervision, and raises practical difficulties. In an attempt to overcome this obstacle, we further introduce a self-driven reconstruction process that concurrently optimizes both the network weights and the input while eliminating the need for training data. Our method incorporates a novel denoiser regularization term which enables robust and stable joint estimation of both the network input and reconstructed image. We demonstrate that our self-guided method surpasses both the original DIP and modern <b>supervised</b> methods in terms of MR image reconstruction performance and outperforms previous DIP-based schemes for image inpainting.

**ABSTRACT**  
This study introduces Polyp-DDPM, a diffusion-based method for generating realistic images of polyps conditioned on masks, aimed at enhancing the segmentation of gastrointestinal (GI) tract polyps. Our approach addresses the challenges of data limitations, high annotation costs, and privacy concerns associated with medical images. By conditioning the diffusion model on segmentation masks-binary masks that represent abnormal areas-Polyp-DDPM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of image quality (achieving a Frechet Inception Distance (FID) score of 78.47, compared to scores above 83.79) and segmentation performance (achieving an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.7156, versus less than 0.6694 for synthetic images from baseline models and 0.7067 for real data). Our method generates a high-quality, diverse synthetic dataset for training, thereby enhancing polyp segmentation models to be comparable with real images and offering greater <b>data</b> <b>augmentation</b> capabilities to improve segmentation models. The source code and pretrained weights for Polyp-DDPM are made publicly available at https://github.com/mobaidoctor/polyp-ddpm.

**ABSTRACT**  
In autonomous driving tasks, trajectory prediction in complex traffic environments requires adherence to real-world context conditions and behavior multimodalities. Existing methods predominantly rely on prior assumptions or generative models trained on curated data to learn road agents' stochastic behavior bounded by scene constraints. However, they often face mode averaging issues due to data imbalance and simplistic priors, and could even suffer from mode collapse due to unstable training and single ground truth supervision. These issues lead the existing methods to a loss of predictive diversity and adherence to the scene constraints. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel trajectory generator named Controllable Diffusion Trajectory (CDT), which integrates map information and social interactions into a Transformer-based conditional denoising diffusion model to guide the prediction of future trajectories. To ensure multimodality, we incorporate behavioral tokens to direct the trajectory's modes, such as going straight, turning right or left. Moreover, we incorporate the predicted endpoints as an alternative behavioral token into the CDT model to facilitate the prediction of accurate trajectories. Extensive experiments on the Argoverse 2 benchmark demonstrate that CDT excels in generating diverse and scene-compliant trajectories in complex urban settings.

**ABSTRACT**  
We introduce EscherNet, a multi-view conditioned diffusion model for view synthesis. EscherNet learns implicit and generative 3D representations coupled with a specialised camera positional encoding, allowing precise and continuous relative control of the camera transformation between an arbitrary number of reference and target views. EscherNet offers exceptional generality, flexibility, and scalability in view synthesis -- it can generate more than 100 consistent target views simultaneously on a single consumer-grade GPU, despite being trained with a fixed number of 3 reference views to 3 target views. As a result, EscherNet not only addresses <b>zero-shot</b> novel view synthesis, but also naturally unifies single- and multi-image 3D reconstruction, combining these diverse tasks into a single, cohesive framework. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that EscherNet achieves state-of-the-art performance in multiple benchmarks, even when compared to methods specifically tailored for each individual problem. This remarkable versatility opens up new directions for designing scalable neural architectures for 3D vision. Project page: \url{https://kxhit.github.io/EscherNet}.

**ABSTRACT**  
We propose a novel constraint called Multiple Spectral filter Operators Preservation (MSFOR) to compute functional maps and based on it, develop an efficient deep functional map architecture called Deep MSFOP for shape matching. The core idea is that, instead of using the general descriptor preservation constraint, we require our maps to preserve multiple spectral filter operators. This allows us to incorporate more informative geometrical information, contained in different frequency bands of functions, into the functional map computing. This can be confirmed by that some previous techniques like wavelet preservation and LBO commutativity are actually our special cases. Moreover, we also develop a very efficient way to compute the maps with MSFOP constraint, which can be conveniently embedded into the deep learning, especially having learnable filter operators. Utilizing the above results, we finally design our Deep MSFOP pipeline, equipped with a suitable <b>unsupervised</b> loss jointly penalizing the functional map and the underlying pointwise map. Our deep functional map has notable advantages, including that the functional map is more geometrically informative and guaranteed to be proper, and the computing is numerically stable. Extensive experimental results on different datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods, especially in challenging settings like non-isometric and inconsistent topology datasets.

**ABSTRACT**  
Automatic radiology report generation is booming due to its huge application potential for the healthcare industry. However, existing computer vision and natural language processing approaches to tackle this problem are limited in two aspects. First, when extracting image features, most of them neglect multi-view <b>reasoning</b> in vision and model single-view structure of medical images, such as space-view or channel-view. However, clinicians rely on multi-view imaging information for comprehensive judgment in daily clinical diagnosis. Second, when generating reports, they overlook context <b>reasoning</b> with multi-modal information and focus on pure textual optimization utilizing retrieval-based methods. We aim to address these two issues by proposing a model that better simulates clinicians' perspectives and generates more accurate reports. Given the above limitation in feature extraction, we propose a Globally-intensive Attention (GIA) module in the medical image encoder to simulate and integrate multi-view vision perception. GIA aims to learn three types of vision perception: depth view, space view, and pixel view. On the other hand, to address the above problem in report generation, we explore how to involve multi-modal signals to generate precisely matched reports, i.e., how to integrate previously predicted words with region-aware visual content in next word prediction. Specifically, we design a Visual Knowledge-guided Decoder (VKGD), which can adaptively consider how much the model needs to rely on visual information and previously predicted text to assist next word prediction. Hence, our final Intensive Vision-guided Network (IVGN) framework includes a GIA-guided Visual Encoder and the VKGD. Experiments on two commonly-used datasets IU X-Ray and MIMIC-CXR demonstrate the superior ability of our method compared with other state-of-the-art approaches.

**ABSTRACT**  
Current state-of-the-art Video-based Person Re-Identification (Re-ID) primarily relies on appearance features extracted by deep learning models. These methods are not applicable for long-term analysis in real-world scenarios where persons have changed clothes, making appearance information unreliable. In this work, we deal with the practical problem of Video-based Cloth-Changing Person Re-ID (VCCRe-ID) by proposing "Attention-based Shape and Gait Representations Learning" (ASGL) for VCCRe-ID. Our ASGL framework improves Re-ID performance under clothing variations by learning clothing-invariant gait cues using a Spatial-Temporal Graph Attention Network (ST-GAT). Given the 3D-skeleton-based spatial-temporal graph, our proposed ST-GAT comprises multi-head attention modules, which are able to enhance the robustness of gait embeddings under viewpoint changes and occlusions. The ST-GAT amplifies the important motion ranges and reduces the influence of noisy poses. Then, the multi-head learning module effectively reserves beneficial local temporal dynamics of movement. We also boost discriminative power of person representations by learning body shape cues using a GAT. Experiments on two large-scale VCCRe-ID datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 12.2% in rank-1 accuracy and 7.0% in mAP.

**ABSTRACT**  
Guided image synthesis methods, like SDEdit based on the diffusion model, excel at creating realistic images from user inputs such as stroke paintings. However, existing efforts mainly focus on image quality, often overlooking a key point: the diffusion model represents a data distribution, not individual images. This introduces a low but critical chance of generating images that contradict user intentions, raising ethical concerns. For example, a user inputting a stroke painting with female characteristics might, with some probability, get male faces from SDEdit. To expose this potential vulnerability, we aim to build an <b>adversarial</b> <b>attack</b> forcing SDEdit to generate a specific data distribution aligned with a specified attribute (e.g., female), without changing the input's attribute characteristics. We propose the Targeted Attribute Generative Attack (TAGA), using an attribute-aware objective function and optimizing the adversarial noise added to the input stroke painting. Empirical studies reveal that traditional adversarial noise struggles with TAGA, while natural perturbations like exposure and motion blur easily alter generated images' attributes. To execute effective attacks, we introduce FoolSDEdit: We design a joint adversarial exposure and blur attack, adding exposure and motion blur to the stroke painting and optimizing them together. We optimize the execution strategy of various perturbations, framing it as a network architecture search problem. We create the SuperPert, a graph representing diverse execution strategies for different perturbations. After training, we obtain the optimized execution strategy for effective TAGA against SDEdit. Comprehensive experiments on two datasets show our method compelling SDEdit to generate a targeted attribute-aware data distribution, significantly outperforming baselines.

**ABSTRACT**  
Multi-view 3D object detectors struggle with duplicate predictions due to the lack of depth information, resulting in false positive detections. In this study, we introduce BEAM, a novel Beta Distribution Ray Denoising approach that can be applied to any DETR-style multi-view 3D detector to explicitly incorporate structure prior knowledge of the scene. By generating rays from cameras to objects and sampling spatial denoising queries from the Beta distribution family along these rays, BEAM enhances the model's ability to distinguish spatial hard negative samples arising from ambiguous depths. BEAM is a plug-and-play technique that adds only marginal computational costs during training, while impressively preserving the inference speed. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on the NuScenes dataset demonstrate significant improvements over strong baselines, outperforming the state-of-the-art method StreamPETR by 1.9% mAP. The code will be available at https://github.com/LiewFeng/BEAM.

**ABSTRACT**  
Cancer subtyping is one of the most challenging tasks in digital pathology, where <b>Multiple</b> <b>Instance</b> <b>Learning</b> (MIL) by processing gigapixel whole slide images (WSIs) has been in the spotlight of recent research. However, MIL approaches do not take advantage of inter- and intra-magnification information contained in WSIs. In this work, we present GRASP, a novel graph-structured multi-magnification framework for processing WSIs in digital pathology. Our approach is designed to dynamically emulate the pathologist's behavior in handling WSIs and benefits from the hierarchical structure of WSIs. GRASP, which introduces a convergence-based node aggregation instead of traditional pooling mechanisms, outperforms state-of-the-art methods over two distinct cancer datasets by a margin of up to 10% balanced accuracy, while being 7 times smaller than the closest-performing state-of-the-art model in terms of the number of parameters. Our results show that GRASP is dynamic in finding and consulting with different magnifications for subtyping cancers and is reliable and stable across different hyperparameters. The model's behavior has been evaluated by two expert pathologists confirming the interpretability of the model's dynamic. We also provide a theoretical foundation, along with empirical evidence, for our work, explaining how GRASP interacts with different magnifications and nodes in the graph to make predictions. We believe that the strong characteristics yet simple structure of GRASP will encourage the development of interpretable, structure-based designs for WSI representation in digital pathology. Furthermore, we publish two large graph datasets of rare Ovarian and Bladder cancers to contribute to the field.

**ABSTRACT**  
Graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained popularity for various graph-related tasks. However, similar to deep neural networks, GNNs are also vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Empirical studies have shown that adversarially robust generalization has a pivotal role in establishing effective defense algorithms against adversarial attacks. In this paper, we contribute by providing adversarially robust generalization bounds for two kinds of popular GNNs, <b>graph</b> <b>convolutional</b> <b>network</b> (GCN) and message passing graph neural network, using the PAC-Bayesian framework. Our result reveals that spectral norm of the diffusion matrix on the graph and spectral norm of the weights as well as the perturbation factor govern the robust generalization bounds of both models. Our bounds are nontrivial generalizations of the results developed in (Liao et al., 2020) from the standard setting to adversarial setting while avoiding exponential dependence of the maximum node degree. As corollaries, we derive better PAC-Bayesian robust generalization bounds for <b>GCN</b> in the standard setting, which improve the bounds in (Liao et al., 2020) by avoiding exponential dependence on the maximum node degree.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Supervised</b> <b>learning</b> has recently garnered significant attention in the field of computational physics due to its ability to effectively extract complex patterns for tasks like solving partial differential equations, or predicting material properties. Traditionally, such datasets consist of inputs given as meshes with a large number of nodes representing the problem geometry (seen as graphs), and corresponding outputs obtained with a numerical solver. This means the <b>supervised</b> <b>learning</b> model must be able to handle large and sparse graphs with continuous node attributes. In this work, we focus on <b>Gaussian</b> <b>process</b> regression, for which we introduce the Sliced Wasserstein Weisfeiler-Lehman (SWWL) graph kernel. In contrast to existing graph kernels, the proposed SWWL kernel enjoys positive definiteness and a drastic complexity reduction, which makes it possible to process datasets that were previously impossible to handle. The new kernel is first validated on <b>graph</b> <b>classification</b> for molecular datasets, where the input graphs have a few tens of nodes. The efficiency of the SWWL kernel is then illustrated on graph regression in computational fluid dynamics and solid mechanics, where the input graphs are made up of tens of thousands of nodes.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this study, we consider the reliability assessment of anomaly detection (AD) using <b>Variational</b> <b>Autoencoder</b> (VAE). Over the last decade, VAE-based AD has been actively studied in various perspective, from method development to applied research. However, when the results of ADs are used in high-stakes decision-making, such as in medical diagnosis, it is necessary to ensure the reliability of the detected anomalies. In this study, we propose the VAE-AD Test as a method for quantifying the statistical reliability of VAE-based AD within the framework of statistical testing. Using the VAE-AD Test, the reliability of the anomaly regions detected by a VAE can be quantified in the form of p-values. This means that if an anomaly is declared when the p-value is below a certain threshold, it is possible to control the probability of false detection to a desired level. Since the VAE-AD Test is constructed based on a new statistical inference framework called selective inference, its validity is theoretically guaranteed in finite samples. To demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed VAE-AD Test, numerical experiments on artificial data and applications to brain image analysis are conducted.

**ABSTRACT**  
With the advent of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), various domains of science and engineering communites has leveraged data-driven surrogates to model complex systems from numerous sources of information (data). The proliferation has led to significant reduction in cost and time involved in development of superior systems designed to perform specific functionalities. A high proposition of such surrogates are built extensively fusing multiple sources of data, may it be published papers, patents, open repositories, or other resources. However, not much attention has been paid to the differences in quality and comprehensiveness of the known and unknown underlying physical parameters of the information sources that could have downstream implications during system optimization. Towards resolving this issue, a multi-source data fusion framework based on Latent Variable <b>Gaussian</b> <b>Process</b> (LVGP) is proposed. The individual data sources are tagged as a characteristic categorical variable that are mapped into a physically interpretable latent space, allowing the development of source-aware data fusion modeling. Additionally, a dissimilarity metric based on the latent variables of LVGP is introduced to study and understand the differences in the sources of data. The proposed approach is demonstrated on and analyzed through two mathematical (representative parabola problem, 2D Ackley function) and two materials science (design of FeCrAl and SmCoFe alloys) case studies. From the case studies, it is observed that compared to using single-source and source unaware ML models, the proposed multi-source data fusion framework can provide better predictions for sparse-data problems, interpretability regarding the sources, and enhanced modeling capabilities by taking advantage of the correlations and relationships among different sources.

**ABSTRACT**  
It is well known that the state space (SS) model formulation of a <b>Gaussian</b> <b>process</b> (GP) can lower its training and prediction time both to O(n) for n data points. We prove that an $m$-dimensional SS model formulation of GP is equivalent to a concept we introduce as the general right Kernel Packet (KP): a transformation for the GP covariance function $K$ such that $\sum_{i=0}^{m}a_iD_t^{(j)}K(t,t_i)=0$ holds for any $t \leq t_1$, 0 $\leq j \leq m-1$, and $m+1$ consecutive points $t_i$, where ${D}_t^{(j)}f(t) $ denotes $j$-th order derivative acting on $t$. We extend this idea to the backward SS model formulation of the GP, leading to the concept of the left KP for next $m$ consecutive points: $\sum_{i=0}^{m}b_i{D}_t^{(j)}K(t,t_{m+i})=0$ for any $t\geq t_{2m}$. By combining both left and right KPs, we can prove that a suitable linear combination of these covariance functions yields $m$ compactly supported KP functions: $\phi^{(j)}(t)=0$ for any $t\not\in(t_0,t_{2m})$ and $j=0,\cdots,m-1$. KPs further reduce the prediction time of GP to O(log n) or even O(1), can be applied to more general problems involving the derivative of GPs, and have multi-dimensional generalization for scattered data.

**ABSTRACT**  
We study the effect of the batch size to the total gradient variance in differentially private <b>stochastic</b> <b>gradient</b> <b>descent</b> (DP-SGD), seeking a theoretical explanation for the usefulness of large batch sizes. As DP-SGD is the basis of modern DP deep learning, its properties have been widely studied, and recent works have empirically found large batch sizes to be beneficial. However, theoretical explanations of this benefit are currently heuristic at best. We first observe that the total gradient variance in DP-SGD can be decomposed into subsampling-induced and noise-induced variances. We then prove that in the limit of an infinite number of iterations, the effective noise-induced variance is invariant to the batch size. The remaining subsampling-induced variance decreases with larger batch sizes, so large batches reduce the effective total gradient variance. We confirm numerically that the asymptotic regime is relevant in practical settings when the batch size is not small, and find that outside the asymptotic regime, the total gradient variance decreases even more with large batch sizes. We also find a sufficient condition that implies that large batch sizes similarly reduce effective DP noise variance for one iteration of DP-SGD.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Unsupervised</b> <b>automatic</b> <b>speech</b> <b>recognition</b> (ASR) aims to learn the mapping between the speech signal and its corresponding textual transcription without the supervision of paired speech-text data. A word/phoneme in the speech signal is represented by a segment of speech signal with variable length and unknown boundary, and this segmental structure makes learning the mapping between speech and text challenging, especially without paired data. In this paper, we propose REBORN, Reinforcement-Learned Boundary Segmentation with Iterative Training for <b>Unsupervised</b> ASR. REBORN alternates between (1) training a segmentation model that predicts the boundaries of the segmental structures in speech signals and (2) training the phoneme prediction model, whose input is a segmental structure segmented by the segmentation model, to predict a phoneme transcription. Since <b>supervised</b> data for training the segmentation model is not available, we use <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning</b> to train the segmentation model to favor segmentations that yield phoneme sequence predictions with a lower perplexity. We conduct extensive experiments and find that under the same setting, REBORN outperforms all prior <b>unsupervised</b> <b>ASR</b> models on LibriSpeech, TIMIT, and five non-English languages in Multilingual LibriSpeech. We comprehensively analyze why the boundaries learned by REBORN improve the <b>unsupervised</b> <b>ASR</b> performance.

**ABSTRACT**  
In daily life, we encounter a variety of sounds, both desirable and undesirable, with limited control over their presence and volume. Our work introduces "Listen, Chat, and Edit" (LCE), a novel multimodal sound mixture editor that modifies each sound source in a mixture based on user-provided text instructions. LCE distinguishes itself with a user-friendly chat interface and its unique ability to edit multiple sound sources simultaneously within a mixture, without needing to separate them. Users input open-vocabulary text prompts, which are interpreted by a <b>large</b> <b>language</b> <b>model</b> to create a semantic filter for editing the sound mixture. The system then decomposes the mixture into its components, applies the semantic filter, and reassembles it into the desired output. We developed a 160-hour dataset with over 100k mixtures, including speech and various audio sources, along with text prompts for diverse editing tasks like extraction, removal, and volume control. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in signal quality across all editing tasks and robust performance in <b>zero-shot</b> scenarios with varying numbers and types of sound sources.

**ABSTRACT**  
We introduce SELF-DISCOVER, a general framework for LLMs to self-discover the task-intrinsic <b>reasoning</b> structures to tackle complex <b>reasoning</b> problems that are challenging for typical prompting methods. Core to the framework is a self-discovery process where LLMs select multiple atomic <b>reasoning</b> modules such as critical thinking and step-by-step thinking, and compose them into an explicit <b>reasoning</b> structure for LLMs to follow during decoding. SELF-DISCOVER substantially improves <b>GPT-4</b> and <b>PaLM</b> 2's performance on challenging <b>reasoning</b> benchmarks such as BigBench-Hard, grounded agent reasoning, and MATH, by as much as 32% compared to Chain of Thought (CoT). Furthermore, SELF-DISCOVER outperforms inference-intensive methods such as CoT-Self-Consistency by more than 20%, while requiring 10-40x fewer inference compute. Finally, we show that the self-discovered <b>reasoning</b> structures are universally applicable across model families: from <b>PaLM</b> 2-L to GPT-4, and from <b>GPT-4</b> to Llama2, and share commonalities with human <b>reasoning</b> patterns.

**ABSTRACT**  
This study consists of a novel approach toward the analysis of court judgments spanning five countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Rwanda, Sweden and Hong Kong. This study also explores the intersection of the latest advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and legal analysis, emphasizing the role of AI (specifically generative AI) in identifying human biases and facilitating automated, valid, and coherent multisided argumentation of court judgments with the goal of ensuring consistent application of laws in and across various jurisdictions. By incorporating Advanced Language Models (ALMs) and a newly introduced human-AI collaborative framework, this paper seeks to analyze Grounded Theory-based research design with Advanced Language Models (ALMs) in the practice of law. SHIRLEY is the name of the AI-based application (built on top of OpenAI's <b>GPT</b> technology), focusing on detecting logical inconsistencies and biases across various legal decisions. SHIRLEY analysis is aggregated and is accompanied by a comparison-oriented AI-based application called SAM (also an ALM) to identify relative deviations in SHIRLEY bias detections. Further, a CRITIC is generated within semi-autonomous arbitration process via the ALM, SARA. A novel approach is introduced in the utilization of an AI arbitrator to critically evaluate biases and qualitative-in-nature nuances identified by the aforementioned AI applications (SAM in concert with SHIRLEY), based on the Hague Rules on Business and Human Rights Arbitration. This Semi-Automated Arbitration Process (SAAP) aims to uphold the integrity and <b>fairness</b> of legal judgments by ensuring a nuanced debate-resultant "understanding" through a hybrid system of AI and human-based collaborative analysis.

**ABSTRACT**  
The paper introduces SceMQA, a novel benchmark for scientific multimodal <b>question</b> <b>answering</b> at the college entrance level. It addresses a critical educational phase often overlooked in existing benchmarks, spanning high school to pre-college levels. SceMQA focuses on core science subjects including Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. It features a blend of multiple-choice and free-response formats, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of AI models' abilities. Additionally, our benchmark provides specific knowledge points for each problem and detailed explanations for each answer. SceMQA also uniquely presents problems with identical contexts but varied questions to facilitate a more thorough and accurate assessment of <b>reasoning</b> capabilities. In the experiment, we evaluate both open-source and close-source state-of-the-art Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), across various experimental settings. The results show that further research and development are needed in developing more capable MLLM, as highlighted by only 50% to 60% accuracy achieved by the strongest models. Our benchmark and analysis will be available at https://scemqa.github.io/

**ABSTRACT**  
Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated a number of human-like abilities, however the empathic understanding and emotional state of LLMs is yet to be aligned to that of humans. In this work, we investigate how the emotional state of generative <b>LLM</b> agents evolves as they perceive new events, introducing a novel architecture in which new experiences are compared to past memories. Through this comparison, the agent gains the ability to understand new experiences in context, which according to the appraisal theory of emotion is vital in emotion creation. First, the agent perceives new experiences as time series text data. After perceiving each new input, the agent generates a summary of past relevant memories, referred to as the norm, and compares the new experience to this norm. Through this comparison we can analyse how the agent reacts to the new experience in context. The PANAS, a test of affect, is administered to the agent, capturing the emotional state of the agent after the perception of the new event. Finally, the new experience is then added to the agents memory to be used in the creation of future norms. By creating multiple experiences in natural language from emotionally charged situations, we test the proposed architecture on a wide range of scenarios. The mixed results suggests that introducing context can occasionally improve the emotional alignment of the agent, but further study and comparison with human evaluators is necessary. We hope that this paper is another step towards the alignment of generative agents.

**ABSTRACT**  
Developing a generalist agent is a longstanding objective in artificial intelligence. Previous efforts utilizing extensive offline datasets from various tasks demonstrate remarkable performance in multitasking scenarios within Reinforcement Learning. However, these works encounter challenges in extending their capabilities to new tasks. Recent approaches integrate textual guidance or visual trajectory into decision networks to provide task-specific contextual cues, representing a promising direction. However, it is observed that relying solely on textual guidance or visual trajectory is insufficient for accurately conveying the contextual information of tasks. This paper explores enhanced forms of task guidance for agents, enabling them to comprehend gameplay instructions, thereby facilitating a "read-to-play" capability. Drawing inspiration from the success of multimodal <b>instruction</b> <b>tuning</b> in visual tasks, we treat the visual-based RL task as a long-horizon vision task and construct a set of multimodal game instructions to incorporate <b>instruction</b> <b>tuning</b> into a decision transformer. Experimental results demonstrate that incorporating multimodal game instructions significantly enhances the decision transformer's multitasking and generalization capabilities.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper presents RevOrder, a novel technique aimed at improving arithmetic operations in large language models (LLMs) by reversing the output digits in addition, subtraction, and n-digit by 1-digit (nD by 1D) multiplication tasks. Our method significantly reduces the Count of Sequential Intermediate Digits (CSID) to $\mathcal{O}(1)$, a new metric we introduce to assess equation complexity. Through comprehensive testing, RevOrder not only achieves perfect accuracy in basic arithmetic operations but also substantially boosts <b>LLM</b> performance in division tasks, particularly with large numbers where traditional models struggle. Implementation of RevOrder is cost-effective for both training and inference phases. Moreover, applying RevOrder to <b>fine-tune</b> the LLaMA2-7B model on the GSM8K math task results in a considerable improvement, reducing equation calculation errors by 46% and increasing overall scores from 41.6 to 44.4.

**ABSTRACT**  
Humans extract useful abstractions of the world from noisy sensory data. Serial reproduction allows us to study how people construe the world through a paradigm similar to the game of telephone, where one person observes a stimulus and reproduces it for the next to form a chain of reproductions. Past serial reproduction experiments typically employ a single sensory modality, but humans often communicate abstractions of the world to each other through language. To investigate the effect language on the formation of abstractions, we implement a novel multimodal serial reproduction framework by asking people who receive a visual stimulus to reproduce it in a linguistic format, and vice versa. We ran unimodal and multimodal chains with both humans and <b>GPT-4</b> and find that adding language as a modality has a larger effect on human reproductions than GPT-4's. This suggests human visual and linguistic representations are more dissociable than those of GPT-4.

**ABSTRACT**  
Humans have a tendency to see 'human'-like qualities in objects around them. We name our cars, and talk to pets and even household appliances, as if they could understand us as other humans do. This behavior, called anthropomorphism, is also seeing traction in Machine Learning (ML), where human-like intelligence is claimed to be perceived in Large Language Models (LLMs). In this position paper, considering professional incentives, human biases, and general methodological setups, we discuss how the current search for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is a perfect storm for over-attributing human-like qualities to LLMs. In several experiments, we demonstrate that the discovery of human-interpretable patterns in latent spaces should not be a surprising outcome. Also in consideration of common AI portrayal in the media, we call for the academic community to exercise extra caution, and to be extra aware of principles of academic integrity, in interpreting and communicating about AI research outcomes.

**ABSTRACT**  
Node Importance Estimation (NIE) is crucial for integrating external information into Large Language Models through Retriever-Augmented Generation. Traditional methods, focusing on static, single-graph characteristics, lack adaptability to new graphs and user-specific requirements. CADReN, our proposed method, addresses these limitations by introducing a Contextual Anchor (CA) mechanism. This approach enables the network to assess node importance relative to the CA, considering both structural and semantic features within Knowledge Graphs (KGs). Extensive experiments show that CADReN achieves better performance in cross-graph NIE task, with <b>zero-shot</b> prediction ability. CADReN is also proven to match the performance of previous models on single-graph NIE task. Additionally, we introduce and opensource two new datasets, RIC200 and WK1K, specifically designed for cross-graph NIE research, providing a valuable resource for future developments in this domain.

**ABSTRACT**  
Autonomous agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) that devise plans and tackle real-world challenges have gained prominence.However, tailoring these agents for specialized domains like quantitative investment remains a formidable task. The core challenge involves efficiently building and integrating a domain-specific knowledge base for the agent's learning process. This paper introduces a principled framework to address this challenge, comprising a two-layer loop.In the inner loop, the agent refines its responses by drawing from its knowledge base, while in the outer loop, these responses are tested in real-world scenarios to automatically enhance the knowledge base with new insights.We demonstrate that our approach enables the agent to progressively approximate optimal behavior with provable efficiency.Furthermore, we instantiate this framework through an autonomous agent for mining trading signals named QuantAgent. Empirical results showcase QuantAgent's capability in uncovering viable financial signals and enhancing the accuracy of financial forecasts.

**ABSTRACT**  
Machine learning models that automate decision-making are increasingly being used in consequential areas such as loan approvals, pretrial bail approval, hiring, and many more. Unfortunately, most of these models are black-boxes, i.e., they are unable to reveal how they reach these prediction decisions. A need for transparency demands justification for such predictions. An affected individual might also desire explanations to understand why a decision was made. Ethical and legal considerations may further require informing the individual of changes in the input attribute that could be made to produce a desirable outcome. This paper focuses on the latter problem of automatically generating counterfactual explanations. We propose a framework Counterfactual Generation with s(CASP) (CFGS) that utilizes answer set programming (ASP) and the s(CASP) goal-directed ASP system to automatically generate counterfactual explanations from rules generated by rule-based machine learning (RBML) algorithms. In our framework, we show how counterfactual explanations are computed and justified by imagining worlds where some or all factual assumptions are altered/changed. More importantly, we show how we can navigate between these worlds, namely, go from our original world/scenario where we obtain an undesired outcome to the imagined world/scenario where we obtain a desired/favourable outcome.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper presents a model of pedestrian crossing decisions, based on the theory of computational rationality. It is assumed that crossing decisions are boundedly optimal, with bounds on optimality arising from human cognitive limitations. While previous models of pedestrian behaviour have been either 'black-box' machine learning models or mechanistic models with explicit assumptions about cognitive factors, we combine both approaches. Specifically, we model mechanistically noisy human visual perception and assumed rewards in crossing, but we use <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning</b> to learn bounded optimal behaviour policy. The model reproduces a larger number of known empirical phenomena than previous models, in particular: (1) the effect of the time to arrival of an approaching vehicle on whether the pedestrian accepts the gap, the effect of the vehicle's speed on both (2) gap acceptance and (3) pedestrian timing of crossing in front of yielding vehicles, and (4) the effect on this crossing timing of the stopping distance of the yielding vehicle. Notably, our findings suggest that behaviours previously framed as 'biases' in decision-making, such as speed-dependent gap acceptance, might instead be a product of rational adaptation to the constraints of visual perception. Our approach also permits fitting the parameters of cognitive constraints and rewards per individual, to better account for individual differences. To conclude, by leveraging both RL and mechanistic modelling, our model offers novel insights about pedestrian behaviour, and may provide a useful foundation for more accurate and scalable pedestrian models.

**ABSTRACT**  
Large-scale generative models are shown to be useful for sampling meaningful candidate solutions, yet they often overlook task constraints and user preferences. Their full power is better harnessed when the models are coupled with external verifiers and the final solutions are derived iteratively or progressively according to the verification feedback. In the context of embodied AI, verification often solely involves assessing whether goal conditions specified in the instructions have been met. Nonetheless, for these agents to be seamlessly integrated into daily life, it is crucial to account for a broader range of constraints and preferences beyond bare task success (e.g., a robot should grasp bread with care to avoid significant deformations). However, given the unbounded scope of robot tasks, it is infeasible to construct scripted verifiers akin to those used for explicit-knowledge tasks like the game of Go and theorem proving. This begs the question: when no sound verifier is available, can we use large vision and language models (VLMs), which are approximately omniscient, as scalable Behavior Critics to catch undesirable robot behaviors in videos? To answer this, we first construct a benchmark that contains diverse cases of goal-reaching yet undesirable robot policies. Then, we comprehensively evaluate VLM critics to gain a deeper understanding of their strengths and failure modes. Based on the evaluation, we provide guidelines on how to effectively utilize VLM critiques and showcase a practical way to integrate the feedback into an iterative process of policy refinement. The dataset and codebase are released at: https://guansuns.github.io/pages/vlm-critic.

**ABSTRACT**  
Humans possess a remarkable capacity to recognize and manipulate abstract structure, which is especially apparent in the domain of geometry. Recent research in cognitive science suggests neural networks do not share this capacity, concluding that human geometric abilities come from discrete symbolic structure in human mental representations. However, progress in artificial intelligence (AI) suggests that neural networks begin to demonstrate more human-like <b>reasoning</b> after scaling up standard architectures in both model size and amount of training data. In this study, we revisit empirical results in cognitive science on geometric visual processing and identify three key biases in geometric visual processing: a sensitivity towards complexity, regularity, and the perception of parts and relations. We test tasks from the literature that probe these biases in humans and find that large pre-trained neural network models used in AI demonstrate more human-like abstract geometric processing.

**ABSTRACT**  
Clifford algebras are a natural generalization of the real numbers, the complex numbers, and the quaternions. So far, solely Clifford algebras of the form $Cl_{p,q}$ (i.e., algebras without nilpotent base vectors) have been studied in the context of knowledge graph embeddings. We propose to consider nilpotent base vectors with a nilpotency index of two. In these spaces, denoted $Cl_{p,q,r}$, allows generalizing over approaches based on dual numbers (which cannot be modelled using $Cl_{p,q}$) and capturing patterns that emanate from the absence of higher-order interactions between real and complex parts of entity embeddings. We design two new models for the discovery of the parameters $p$, $q$, and $r$. The first model uses a greedy search to optimize $p$, $q$, and $r$. The second predicts $(p, q,r)$ based on an embedding of the input knowledge graph computed using neural networks. The results of our evaluation on seven benchmark datasets suggest that nilpotent vectors can help capture embeddings better. Our comparison against the state of the art suggests that our approach generalizes better than other approaches on all datasets w.r.t. the MRR it achieves on validation data. We also show that a greedy search suffices to discover values of $p$, $q$ and $r$ that are close to optimal.

**ABSTRACT**  
We propose Embodied AI as the next fundamental step in the pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence, juxtaposing it against current AI advancements, particularly Large Language Models. We traverse the evolution of the embodiment concept across diverse fields - philosophy, psychology, neuroscience, and robotics - to highlight how EAI distinguishes itself from the classical paradigm of static learning. By broadening the scope of Embodied AI, we introduce a theoretical framework based on cognitive architectures, emphasizing perception, action, memory, and learning as essential components of an embodied agent. This framework is aligned with Friston's active inference principle, offering a comprehensive approach to EAI development. Despite the progress made in the field of AI, substantial challenges, such as the formulation of a novel AI learning theory and the innovation of advanced hardware, persist. Our discussion lays down a foundational guideline for future Embodied AI research. Highlighting the importance of creating Embodied AI agents capable of seamless communication, collaboration, and coexistence with humans and other intelligent entities within real-world environments, we aim to steer the AI community towards addressing the multifaceted challenges and seizing the opportunities that lie ahead in the quest for AGI.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Reinforcement</b> <b>Learning</b> (RL) has made significant strides in enabling artificial agents to learn diverse behaviors. However, learning an effective policy often requires a large number of environment interactions. To mitigate sample complexity issues, recent approaches have used high-level task specifications, such as Linear Temporal Logic (LTL$_f$) formulas or Reward Machines (RM), to guide the learning progress of the agent. In this work, we propose a novel approach, called Logical Specifications-guided Dynamic Task Sampling (LSTS), that learns a set of RL policies to guide an agent from an initial state to a goal state based on a high-level task specification, while minimizing the number of environmental interactions. Unlike previous work, LSTS does not assume information about the environment dynamics or the Reward Machine, and dynamically samples promising tasks that lead to successful goal policies. We evaluate LSTS on a gridworld and show that it achieves improved time-to-threshold performance on complex sequential decision-making problems compared to state-of-the-art RM and Automaton-guided RL baselines, such as Q-Learning for Reward Machines and Compositional RL from logical Specifications (DIRL). Moreover, we demonstrate that our method outperforms RM and Automaton-guided RL baselines in terms of sample-efficiency, both in a partially observable robotic task and in a continuous control robotic manipulation task.

**ABSTRACT**  
The prevalence of smart devices with the ability to capture moments in multiple modalities has enabled users to experience multimodal information online. However, large Language (LLMs) and Vision models (LVMs) are still limited in capturing holistic meaning with cross-modal semantic relationships. Without explicit, common sense knowledge (e.g., as a knowledge graph), Visual Language Models (VLMs) only learn implicit representations by capturing high-level patterns in vast corpora, missing essential contextual cross-modal cues. In this work, we design a framework to couple explicit commonsense knowledge in the form of knowledge graphs with large VLMs to improve the performance of a downstream task, predicting the effectiveness of multi-modal marketing campaigns. While the marketing application provides a compelling metric for assessing our methods, our approach enables the early detection of likely persuasive multi-modal campaigns and the assessment and augmentation of marketing theory.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Weakly</b> <b>supervised</b> <b>learning</b> with noisy data has drawn attention in the medical imaging community due to the sparsity of high-quality disease labels. However, little is known about the limitations of such <b>weakly</b> <b>supervised</b> <b>learning</b> and the effect of these constraints on disease classification performance. In this paper, we test the effects of such <b>weak</b> <b>supervision</b> by examining model tolerance for three conditions. First, we examined model tolerance for noisy data by incrementally increasing error in the labels within the training data. Second, we assessed the impact of dataset size by varying the amount of training data. Third, we compared performance differences between binary and multi-label classification. Results demonstrated that the model could endure up to 10% added label error before experiencing a decline in disease classification performance. Disease classification performance steadily rose as the amount of training data was increased for all disease classes, before experiencing a plateau in performance at 75% of training data. Last, the binary model outperformed the multilabel model in every disease category. However, such interpretations may be misleading, as the binary model was heavily influenced by co-occurring diseases and may not have learned the specific features of the disease in the image. In conclusion, this study may help the medical imaging community understand the benefits and risks of <b>weak</b> <b>supervision</b> with noisy labels. Such studies demonstrate the need to build diverse, large-scale datasets and to develop explainable and responsible AI.

**ABSTRACT**  
Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) for fluorescence-guided brain tumor resection enables visualization of differences between tissues that are not distinguishable to humans. This augmentation can maximize brain tumor resection, improving patient outcomes. However, much of the processing in HSI uses simplified linear methods that are unable to capture the non-linear, wavelength-dependent phenomena that must be modeled for accurate recovery of fluorophore abundances. We therefore propose two deep learning models for correction and unmixing, which can account for the nonlinear effects and produce more accurate estimates of abundances. Both models use an autoencoder-like architecture to process the captured spectra. One is trained with protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) concentration labels. The other undergoes semi-supervised training, first learning hyperspectral unmixing <b>self-supervised</b> and then learning to correct fluorescence emission spectra for heterogeneous optical and geometric properties using a reference white-light reflectance spectrum in a <b>few-shot</b> manner. The models were evaluated against phantom and pig brain data with known PpIX concentration; the <b>supervised</b> model achieved Pearson correlation coefficients (R values) between the known and computed PpIX concentrations of 0.997 and 0.990, respectively, whereas the classical approach achieved only 0.93 and 0.82. The semi-supervised approach's R values were 0.98 and 0.91, respectively. On human data, the semi-supervised model gives qualitatively more realistic results than the classical method, better removing bright spots of specular reflectance and reducing the variance in PpIX abundance over biopsies that should be relatively homogeneous. These results show promise for using deep learning to improve HSI in fluorescence-guided neurosurgery.

**ABSTRACT**  
Studying the morphological development of cartilaginous and osseous structures is critical to the early detection of life-threatening skeletal dysmorphology. Embryonic cartilage undergoes rapid structural changes within hours, introducing biological variations and morphological shifts that limit the generalization of deep learning-based segmentation models that infer across multiple embryonic age groups. Obtaining individual models for each age group is expensive and less effective, while direct transfer (predicting an age unseen during training) suffers a potential performance drop due to morphological shifts. We propose a novel Transformer-based segmentation model with improved biological priors that better distills morphologically diverse information through conditional mechanisms. This enables a single model to accurately predict cartilage across multiple age groups. Experiments on the mice cartilage dataset show the superiority of our new model compared to other competitive segmentation models. Additional studies on a separate mice cartilage dataset with a distinct mutation show that our model generalizes well and effectively captures age-based cartilage morphology patterns.

**ABSTRACT**  
This study introduces the 3D Residual-in-Residual Dense Block <b>GAN</b> (3D RRDB-GAN) for 3D super-resolution for radiology imagery. A key aspect of 3D RRDB-GAN is the integration of a 2.5D perceptual loss function, which contributes to improved volumetric image quality and realism. The effectiveness of our model was evaluated through 4x super-resolution experiments across diverse datasets, including Mice Brain MRH, OASIS, HCP1200, and MSD-Task-6. These evaluations, encompassing both quantitative metrics like LPIPS and FID and qualitative assessments through sample visualizations, demonstrate the models effectiveness in detailed image analysis. The 3D RRDB-GAN offers a significant contribution to medical imaging, particularly by enriching the depth, clarity, and volumetric detail of medical images. Its application shows promise in enhancing the interpretation and analysis of complex medical imagery from a comprehensive 3D perspective.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this work, we investigate to use Large Language Models (LLMs) for rumor detection on social media. However, it is challenging for LLMs to reason over the entire propagation information on social media, which contains news contents and numerous comments, due to LLMs may not concentrate on key clues in the complex propagation information, and have trouble in <b>reasoning</b> when facing massive and redundant information. Accordingly, we propose an LLM-empowered Rumor Detection (LeRuD) approach, in which we design prompts to teach LLMs to reason over important clues in news and comments, and divide the entire propagation information into a Chain-of-Propagation for reducing LLMs' burden. We conduct extensive experiments on the Twitter and Weibo datasets, and LeRuD outperforms several state-of-the-art rumor detection models by 3.2% to 7.7%. Meanwhile, by applying LLMs, LeRuD requires no data for training, and thus shows more promising rumor detection ability in <b>few-shot</b> or <b>zero-shot</b> scenarios.

**ABSTRACT**  
Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) has greatly advanced applications of Machine Learning (ML) including model compression, machine translation, and computer vision. Recommender Systems (RecSys) can be seen as an application of ML. Yet, AutoML has found little attention in the RecSys community; nor has RecSys found notable attention in the AutoML community. Only few and relatively simple Automated Recommender Systems (AutoRecSys) libraries exist that adopt AutoML techniques. However, these libraries are based on student projects and do not offer the features and thorough development of AutoML libraries. We set out to determine how AutoML libraries perform in the scenario of an inexperienced user who wants to implement a recommender system. We compared the predictive performance of 60 AutoML, AutoRecSys, ML, and RecSys algorithms from 15 libraries, including a mean predictor baseline, on 14 explicit feedback RecSys datasets. To simulate the perspective of an inexperienced user, the algorithms were evaluated with default hyperparameters. We found that AutoML and AutoRecSys libraries performed best. AutoML libraries performed best for six of the 14 datasets (43%), but it was not always the same AutoML library performing best. The single-best library was the AutoRecSys library Auto-Surprise, which performed best on five datasets (36%). On three datasets (21%), AutoML libraries performed poorly, and RecSys libraries with default parameters performed best. Although, while obtaining 50% of all placements in the top five per dataset, RecSys algorithms fall behind AutoML on average. ML algorithms generally performed the worst.

**ABSTRACT**  
Users want to know the reliability of the recommendations; they do not accept high predictions if there is no reliability evidence. Recommender systems should provide reliability values associated with the predictions. Research into reliability measures requires the existence of simple, plausible and universal reliability quality measures. Research into <b>recommender</b> <b>system</b> quality measures has focused on accuracy. Moreover, novelty, serendipity and diversity have been studied; nevertheless there is an important lack of research into reliability/confidence quality measures. This paper proposes a reliability quality prediction measure (RPI) and a reliability quality <b>recommendation</b> measure (RRI). Both quality measures are based on the hypothesis that the more suitable a reliability measure is, the better accuracy results it will provide when applied. These reliability quality measures show accuracy improvements when appropriated reliability values are associated with their predictions (i.e. high reliability values associated with correct predictions or low reliability values associated with incorrect predictions). The proposed reliability quality metrics will lead to the design of brand new <b>recommender</b> <b>system</b> reliability measures. These measures could be applied to different matrix factorization techniques and to content-based, context-aware and social <b>recommendation</b> approaches. The <b>recommender</b> <b>system</b> reliability measures designed could be tested, compared and improved using the proposed reliability quality metrics.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recommender systems have made significant strides in various industries, primarily driven by extensive efforts to enhance <b>recommendation</b> accuracy. However, this pursuit of accuracy has inadvertently given rise to echo chamber/filter bubble effects. Especially in industry, it could impair user's experiences and prevent user from accessing a wider range of items. One of the solutions is to take diversity into account. However, most of existing works focus on user's explicit preferences, while rarely exploring user's non-interaction preferences. These neglected non-interaction preferences are especially important for broadening user's interests in alleviating echo chamber/filter bubble effects.Therefore, in this paper, we first define diversity as two distinct definitions, i.e., user-explicit diversity (U-diversity) and user-item non-interaction diversity (N-diversity) based on user historical behaviors. Then, we propose a succinct and effective method, named as Controllable Category Diversity Framework (CCDF) to achieve both high U-diversity and N-diversity simultaneously.Specifically, CCDF consists of two stages, User-Category Matching and Constrained Item Matching. The User-Category Matching utilizes the DeepU2C model and a combined loss to capture user's preferences in categories, and then selects the top-$K$ categories with a controllable parameter $K$.These top-$K$ categories will be used as trigger information in Constrained Item Matching. Offline experimental results show that our proposed DeepU2C outperforms state-of-the-art diversity-oriented methods, especially on N-diversity task. The whole framework is validated in a real-world production environment by conducting online A/B testing.

**ABSTRACT**  
Posts in software Q\&A sites often consist of three main parts: title, description and code, which are interconnected and jointly describe the question. Existing tag <b>recommendation</b> methods often treat different modalities as a whole or inadequately consider the interaction between different modalities. Additionally, they focus on extracting information directly from the post itself, neglecting the information from external knowledge sources. Therefore, we propose a Retrieval Augmented Cross-Modal (RACM) Tag <b>Recommendation</b> Model in Software Q\&A Sites. Specifically, we first use the input post as a query and enhance the representation of different modalities by retrieving information from external knowledge sources. For the retrieval-augmented representations, we employ a cross-modal context-aware attention to leverage the main modality description for targeted feature extraction across the submodalities title and code. In the fusion process, a gate mechanism is employed to achieve fine-grained feature selection, controlling the amount of information extracted from the submodalities. Finally, the fused information is used for tag recommendation. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art counterparts.

**ABSTRACT**  
Common click-through rate (CTR) prediction recommender models tend to exhibit feature-level bias, which leads to unfair recommendations among item groups and inaccurate recommendations for users. While existing methods address this issue by adjusting the learning of CTR models, such as through additional optimization objectives, they fail to consider how the bias is caused within these models. To address this research gap, our study performs a top-down analysis on representative CTR models. Through blocking different components of a trained CTR model one by one, we identify the key contribution of the linear component to feature-level bias. We conduct a theoretical analysis of the learning process for the weights in the linear component, revealing how group-wise properties of training data influence them. Our experimental and statistical analyses demonstrate a strong correlation between imbalanced positive sample ratios across item groups and feature-level bias. Based on this understanding, we propose a minimally invasive yet effective strategy to counteract feature-level bias in CTR models by removing the biased linear weights from trained models. Additionally, we present a linear weight adjusting strategy that requires fewer random exposure records than relevant debiasing methods. The superiority of our proposed strategies are validated through extensive experiments on three real-world datasets.

**ABSTRACT**  
In the burgeoning field of autonomous vehicles (AVs), trajectory prediction remains a formidable challenge, especially in mixed autonomy environments. Traditional approaches often rely on computational methods such as time-series analysis. Our research diverges significantly by adopting an interdisciplinary approach that integrates principles of human cognition and observational behavior into trajectory prediction models for AVs. We introduce a novel "adaptive visual sector" mechanism that mimics the dynamic allocation of attention human drivers exhibit based on factors like spatial orientation, proximity, and driving speed. Additionally, we develop a "dynamic traffic graph" using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and <b>Graph</b> <b>Attention</b> <b>Networks</b> (GAT) to capture spatio-temporal dependencies among agents. Benchmark tests on the NGSIM, HighD, and MoCAD datasets reveal that our model (GAVA) outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by at least 15.2%, 19.4%, and 12.0%, respectively. Our findings underscore the potential of leveraging human cognition principles to enhance the proficiency and adaptability of trajectory prediction algorithms in AVs. The code for the proposed model is available at our Github.

**ABSTRACT**  
This work contributes a novel deep navigation policy that enables collision-free flight of aerial robots based on a modular approach exploiting deep collision encoding and reinforcement learning. The proposed solution builds upon a deep collision encoder that is trained on both simulated and real depth images using <b>supervised</b> <b>learning</b> such that it compresses the high-dimensional depth data to a low-dimensional latent space encoding collision information while accounting for the robot size. This compressed encoding is combined with an estimate of the robot's odometry and the desired target location to train a deep <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning</b> navigation policy that offers low-latency computation and robust sim2real performance. A set of <b>simulation</b> and experimental studies in diverse environments are conducted and demonstrate the efficiency of the emerged behavior and its resilience in real-life deployments.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this article, we propose the novel concept of Belief Scene Graphs, which are utility-driven extensions of partial 3D scene graphs, that enable efficient high-level task planning with partial information. We propose a graph-based learning methodology for the computation of belief (also referred to as expectation) on any given 3D scene graph, which is then used to strategically add new nodes (referred to as blind nodes) that are relevant for a robotic mission. We propose the method of Computation of Expectation based on Correlation Information (CECI), to reasonably approximate real Belief/Expectation, by learning histograms from available training data. A novel Graph <b>Convolutional</b> <b>Neural</b> <b>Network</b> (GCN) model is developed, to learn CECI from a repository of 3D scene graphs. As no database of 3D scene graphs exists for the training of the novel CECI model, we present a novel methodology for generating a 3D scene graph dataset based on semantically annotated real-life 3D spaces. The generated dataset is then utilized to train the proposed CECI model and for extensive validation of the proposed method. We establish the novel concept of \textit{Belief Scene Graphs} (BSG), as a core component to integrate expectations into abstract representations. This new concept is an evolution of the classical 3D scene graph concept and aims to enable high-level <b>reasoning</b> for the task planning and optimization of a variety of robotics missions. The efficacy of the overall framework has been evaluated in an object search scenario, and has also been tested on a real-life experiment to emulate human common sense of unseen-objects.

**ABSTRACT**  
Despite the remarkable <b>code</b> <b>generation</b> abilities of large language models LLMs, they still face challenges in complex task handling. Robot development, a highly intricate field, inherently demands human involvement in task allocation and collaborative teamwork . To enhance robot development, we propose an innovative automated collaboration framework inspired by real-world robot developers. This framework employs multiple LLMs in distinct roles analysts, programmers, and testers. Analysts delve deep into user requirements, enabling programmers to produce precise code, while testers <b>fine-tune</b> the parameters based on user feedback for practical robot application. Each <b>LLM</b> tackles diverse, critical tasks within the development process. Clear collaboration rules emulate real world teamwork among LLMs. Analysts, programmers, and testers form a cohesive team overseeing strategy, code, and parameter adjustments . Through this framework, we achieve complex robot development without requiring specialized knowledge, relying solely on non experts participation.

**ABSTRACT**  
Reward engineering has long been a challenge in <b>Reinforcement</b> <b>Learning</b> (RL) research, as it often requires extensive human effort and iterative processes of trial-and-error to design effective reward functions. In this paper, we propose RL-VLM-F, a method that automatically generates reward functions for agents to learn new tasks, using only a text description of the task goal and the agent's visual observations, by leveraging feedbacks from vision language foundation models (VLMs). The key to our approach is to query these models to give preferences over pairs of the agent's image observations based on the text description of the task goal, and then learn a reward function from the preference labels, rather than directly prompting these models to output a raw reward score, which can be noisy and inconsistent. We demonstrate that RL-VLM-F successfully produces effective rewards and policies across various domains - including classic control, as well as manipulation of rigid, articulated, and deformable objects - without the need for human supervision, outperforming prior methods that use large pretrained models for reward generation under the same assumptions.

**ABSTRACT**  
Despite their powerful semantic understanding and <b>code</b> <b>generation</b> capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) still face challenges when dealing with complex tasks. Multi agent strategy generation and motion control are highly complex domains that inherently require experts from multiple fields to collaborate. To enhance multi agent strategy generation and motion control, we propose an innovative architecture that employs the concept of a cloud edge end hierarchical structure. By leveraging multiple large language models with distinct areas of expertise, we can efficiently generate strategies and perform task decomposition. Introducing the cosine similarity approach,aligning task decomposition instructions with robot task sequences at the vector level, we can identify subtasks with incomplete task decomposition and iterate on them multiple times to ultimately generate executable machine task sequences.The robot is guided through these task sequences to complete tasks of higher complexity. With this architecture, we implement the process of natural language control of robots to perform complex tasks, and successfully address the challenge of multi agent execution of open tasks in open scenarios and the problem of task decomposition.

**ABSTRACT**  
Multirotor UAVs are used for a wide spectrum of civilian and public domain applications. Navigation controllers endowed with different attributes and onboard sensor suites enable multirotor autonomous or semi-autonomous, safe flight, operation, and functionality under nominal and detrimental conditions and external disturbances, even when flying in uncertain and dynamically changing environments. During the last decade, given the faster-than-exponential increase of available computational power, different learning-based algorithms have been derived, implemented, and tested to navigate and control, among other systems, multirotor UAVs. Learning algorithms have been, and are used to derive data-driven based models, to identify parameters, to track objects, to develop navigation controllers, and to learn the environment in which multirotors operate. Learning algorithms combined with model-based control techniques have been proven beneficial when applied to multirotors. This survey summarizes published research since 2015, dividing algorithms, techniques, and methodologies into offline and online learning categories, and then, further classifying them into machine learning, deep learning, and <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning</b> sub-categories. An integral part and focus of this survey are on online learning algorithms as applied to multirotors with the aim to register the type of learning techniques that are either hard or almost hard real-time implementable, as well as to understand what information is learned, why, and how, and how fast. The outcome of the survey offers a clear understanding of the recent state-of-the-art and of the type and kind of learning-based algorithms that may be implemented, tested, and executed in real-time.

**ABSTRACT**  
Fish schools present high-efficiency group behaviors through simple individual interactions to collective migration and dynamic escape from the predator. The school behavior of fish is usually a good inspiration to design control architecture for swarm robots. In this paper, a novel fish-inspired self-adaptive approach is proposed for collective escape for the swarm robots. In addition, a bio-inspired neural network (BINN) is introduced to generate collision-free escape robot trajectories through the combination of attractive and repulsive forces. Furthermore, to cope with dynamic environments, a neurodynamics-based self-adaptive mechanism is proposed to improve the self-adaptive performance of the swarm robots in the changing environment. Similar to fish escape maneuvers, <b>simulation</b> and experimental results show that the swarm robots are capable of collectively leaving away from the threats. Several comparison studies demonstrated that the proposed approach can significantly improve the effectiveness and efficiency of system performance, and the flexibility and robustness in complex environments.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper introduces a system designed to generate explanations for the actions performed by an autonomous robot in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI). Explainability in robotics, encapsulated within the concept of an eXplainable Autonomous Robot (XAR), is a growing research area. The work described in this paper aims to take advantage of the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in performing natural language processing tasks. This study focuses on the possibility of generating explanations using such models in combination with a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) method to interpret data gathered from the logs of autonomous systems. In addition, this work also presents a formalization of the proposed explanation system. It has been evaluated through a navigation test from the European Robotics League (ERL), a Europe-wide social robotics competition. Regarding the obtained results, a validation questionnaire has been conducted to measure the quality of the explanations from the perspective of technical users. The results obtained during the experiment highlight the potential utility of LLMs in achieving explanatory capabilities in robots.

**ABSTRACT**  
Predicting the movement of other road users is beneficial for improving automated vehicle (AV) performance. However, the relationship between the time horizon associated with these predictions and AV performance remains unclear. Despite the existence of numerous trajectory prediction algorithms, no studies have been conducted on how varying prediction lengths affect AV safety and other vehicle performance metrics, resulting in undefined horizon requirements for prediction methods. Our study addresses this gap by examining the effects of different prediction horizons on AV performance, focusing on safety, comfort, and efficiency. Through multiple experiments using a state-of-the-art, risk-based predictive trajectory planner, we simulated predictions with horizons up to 20 seconds. Based on our simulations, we propose a framework for specifying the minimum required and optimal prediction horizons based on specific AV performance criteria and application needs. Our results indicate that a horizon of 1.6 seconds is required to prevent collisions with crossing pedestrians, horizons of 7-8 seconds yield the best efficiency, and horizons up to 15 seconds improve passenger comfort. We conclude that prediction horizon requirements are application-dependent, and recommend aiming for a prediction horizon of 11.8 seconds as a general guideline for applications involving crossing pedestrians.

**ABSTRACT**  
The underwater world remains largely unexplored, with Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) playing a crucial role in sub-sea explorations. However, continuous monitoring of underwater environments using AUVs can generate a significant amount of data. In addition, sending live data feed from an underwater environment requires dedicated on-board data storage options for AUVs which can hinder requirements of other higher priority tasks. Informative sampling techniques offer a solution by condensing observations. In this paper, we present a semantically-aware online informative sampling (ON-IS) approach which samples an AUV's visual experience in real-time. Specifically, we obtain visual features from a fine-tuned <b>object</b> <b>detection</b> model to align the sampling outcomes with the desired semantic information. Our contributions are (a) a novel Semantic Online Informative Sampling (SON-IS) algorithm, (b) a user study to validate the proposed approach and (c) a novel evaluation metric to score our proposed algorithm with respect to the suggested samples by human subjects

**ABSTRACT**  
An obstacle toward construction robotization is the lack of methods to plan robot operations within the entire construction planning process. Despite the strength in modeling construction site conditions, 4D BIM technologies cannot perform construction robot task planning considering the contexts of given work environments. To address this limitation, this study presents a framework that integrates 4D BIM and robot task planning, presents an information flow for the integration, and performs high-level robot task planning and detailed simulation. The framework uniquely incorporates a construction robot knowledge base that derives robot-related modeling requirements to augment a 4D BIM model. Then, the 4D BIM model is converted into a robot <b>simulation</b> world where a robot performs a sequence of actions retrieving construction-related information. A case study focusing on the interior wall frame installation demonstrates the potential of systematic integration in achieving context-aware robot task planning and <b>simulation</b> in construction environments.

**ABSTRACT**  
We study how to report <b>few-shot</b> imitation (FSI) policies' behavior errors in novel environments, a novel task named adaptable error detection (AED). The potential to cause serious damage to surrounding areas limits the application of FSI policies in real-world scenarios. Thus, a robust system is necessary to notify operators when FSI policies are inconsistent with the intent of demonstrations. We develop a cross-domain benchmark for the challenging AED task, consisting of 329 base and 158 novel environments. This task introduces three challenges, including (1) detecting behavior errors in novel environments, (2) behavior errors occurring without revealing notable changes, and (3) lacking complete temporal information of the rollout due to the necessity of online detection. To address these challenges, we propose Pattern Observer (PrObe) to parse discernible patterns in the policy feature representations of normal or error states, whose effectiveness is verified in the proposed benchmark. Through our comprehensive evaluation, PrObe consistently surpasses strong baselines and demonstrates a robust capability to identify errors arising from a wide range of FSI policies. Moreover, we conduct comprehensive ablations and experiments (error correction, demonstration quality, etc.) to validate the practicality of our proposed task and methodology.

**ABSTRACT**  
Deep-learning and large scale language-image training have produced image object detectors that generalise well to diverse environments and semantic classes. However, single-image object detectors trained on internet data are not optimally tailored for the embodied conditions inherent in robotics. Instead, robots must detect objects from complex multi-modal data streams involving depth, localisation and temporal correlation, a task termed embodied object detection. Paradigms such as Video <b>Object</b> <b>Detection</b> (VOD) and Semantic Mapping have been proposed to leverage such embodied data streams, but existing work fails to enhance performance using language-image training. In response, we investigate how an image object detector pre-trained using language-image data can be extended to perform embodied object detection. We propose a novel implicit object memory that uses projective geometry to aggregate the features of detected objects across long temporal horizons. The spatial and temporal information accumulated in memory is then used to enhance the image features of the base detector. When tested on embodied data streams sampled from diverse indoor scenes, our approach improves the base object detector by 3.09 mAP, outperforming alternative external memories designed for VOD and Semantic Mapping. Our method also shows a significant improvement of 16.90 mAP relative to baselines that perform embodied <b>object</b> <b>detection</b> without first training on language-image data, and is robust to sensor noise and domain shift experienced in real-world deployment.

**ABSTRACT**  
Locomotion gaits are fundamental for control of soft terrestrial robots. However, synthesis of these gaits is challenging due to modeling of robot-environment interaction and lack of a mathematical framework. This work presents an environment-centric, data-driven and fault-tolerant probabilistic Model-Free Control (pMFC) framework that allows for soft multi-limb robots to learn from their environment and synthesize diverse sets of locomotion gaits for realizing open-loop control. Here, discretization of factors dominating robot-environment interactions enables an environment-specific graphical representation where the edges encode experimental locomotion data corresponding to the robot motion primitives. In this graph, locomotion gaits are defined as simple cycles that are transformation invariant, i.e., the locomotion is independent of the starting vertex of these periodic cycles. Gait synthesis, the problem of finding optimal locomotion gaits for a given substrate, is formulated as Binary Integer Linear Programming (BILP) problems with a linearized cost function, linear constraints, and iterative simple cycle detection. Experimentally, gaits are synthesized for varying robot-environment interactions. Variables include robot morphology - three-limb and four-limb robots, TerreSoRo-III and TerreSoRo-IV; substrate - rubber mat, whiteboard and carpet; and actuator functionality - simulated loss of robot limb actuation. On an average, gait synthesis improves the translation and rotation speeds by 82% and 97% respectively. The results highlight that data-driven methods are vital to soft robot locomotion control due to the significant influence of unexpected asymmetries in the system and the dependence of optimal gait sequences on the experimental robot-environment interaction.

**ABSTRACT**  
The detection of automated accounts, also known as "social bots", has been an increasingly important concern for online social networks (OSNs). While several methods have been proposed for detecting social bots, significant research gaps remain. First, current models exhibit limitations in detecting sophisticated bots that aim to mimic genuine OSN users. Second, these methods often rely on simplistic profile features, which are susceptible to manipulation. In addition to their vulnerability to adversarial manipulations, these models lack generalizability, resulting in subpar performance when trained on one dataset and tested on another. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework for social <b>Bot</b> <b>detection</b> with <b>Self-Supervised</b> <b>Contrastive</b> <b>Learning</b> (BotSSCL). Our framework leverages <b>contrastive</b> <b>learning</b> to distinguish between social bots and humans in the embedding space to improve linear separability. The high-level representations derived by BotSSCL enhance its resilience to variations in data distribution and ensure generalizability. We evaluate BotSSCL's robustness against adversarial attempts to manipulate bot accounts to evade detection. Experiments on two datasets featuring sophisticated bots demonstrate that BotSSCL outperforms other supervised, unsupervised, and <b>self-supervised</b> baseline methods. We achieve approx. 6% and approx. 8% higher (F1) performance than SOTA on both datasets. In addition, BotSSCL also achieves 67% F1 when trained on one dataset and tested with another, demonstrating its generalizability. Lastly, BotSSCL increases adversarial complexity and only allows 4% success to the adversary in evading detection.

**ABSTRACT**  
Studying acquisitions offers invaluable insights into startup trends, aiding informed investment decisions for businesses. However, the scarcity of studies in this domain prompts our focus on shedding light in this area. Employing Crunchbase data, our study delves into the global network of company acquisitions using diverse network analysis techniques. Our findings unveil an acquisition network characterized by a primarily sparse structure comprising localized dense connections. We reveal a prevalent tendency among organizations to acquire companies within their own country and industry. Furthermore, our temporal analysis indicates a growth in network communities over time, accompanied by a trend toward a sparser network. Through centrality metrics computation in the cross-city acquisition network, we identify New York, London, and San Francisco as pivotal and central hubs in the global economic landscape. Finally, we show that the United States, United Kingdom, and Germany are predominant countries in international acquisitions.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper presents an innovative approach to recognizing personality traits using deep learning (DL) methods applied to electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. Within the framework of detecting the big five personality traits model encompassing extra-version, neuroticism, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness, the research explores the potential of ECG-derived spectrograms as informative features. Optimal window sizes for spectrogram generation are determined, and a <b>convolutional</b> <b>neural</b> <b>network</b> (CNN), specifically Resnet-18, and visual <b>transformer</b> (ViT) are employed for feature extraction and personality trait classification. The study utilizes the publicly available ASCERTAIN dataset, which comprises various physiological signals, including ECG recordings, collected from 58 participants during the presentation of video stimuli categorized by valence and arousal levels. The outcomes of this study demonstrate noteworthy performance in personality trait classification, consistently achieving F1-scores exceeding 0.9 across different window sizes and personality traits. These results emphasize the viability of ECG signal spectrograms as a valuable modality for personality trait recognition, with Resnet-18 exhibiting effectiveness in discerning distinct personality traits.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recent developments in computer graphics, hardware, artificial intelligence (AI), and human-computer interaction likely lead to extended reality (XR) devices and setups being more pervasive. While these devices and setups provide users with interactive, engaging, and immersive experiences with different sensing modalities, such as eye and hand trackers, many non-player characters are utilized in a pre-scripted way or by conventional AI techniques. In this paper, we argue for using large language models (LLMs) in XR by embedding them in virtual avatars or as narratives to facilitate more inclusive experiences through <b>prompt</b> engineering according to user profiles and <b>fine-tuning</b> the LLMs for particular purposes. We argue that such inclusion will facilitate diversity for XR use. In addition, we believe that with the versatile conversational capabilities of LLMs, users will engage more with XR environments, which might help XR be more used in everyday life. Lastly, we speculate that combining the information provided to LLM-powered environments by the users and the biometric data obtained through the sensors might lead to novel privacy invasions. While studying such possible privacy invasions, user privacy concerns and preferences should also be investigated. In summary, despite some challenges, embedding LLMs into XR is a promising and novel research area with several opportunities.

**ABSTRACT**  
The rapid development of <b>generative</b> <b>AI</b> (GenAI) models in computer vision necessitates effective evaluation methods to ensure their quality and fairness. Existing tools primarily focus on dataset quality assurance and model explainability, leaving a significant gap in GenAI output evaluation during model development. Current practices often depend on developers' subjective visual assessments, which may lack scalability and generalizability. This paper bridges this gap by conducting a formative study with GenAI model developers in an industrial setting. Our findings led to the development of GenLens, a visual analytic interface designed for the systematic evaluation of GenAI model outputs during the early stages of model development. GenLens offers a quantifiable approach for overviewing and annotating failure cases, customizing issue tags and classifications, and aggregating annotations from multiple users to enhance collaboration. A user study with model developers reveals that GenLens effectively enhances their workflow, evidenced by high satisfaction rates and a strong intent to integrate it into their practices. This research underscores the importance of robust early-stage evaluation tools in GenAI development, contributing to the advancement of fair and high-quality GenAI models.

**ABSTRACT**  
<b>Emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> (ER) technology is an integral part for developing innovative applications such as drowsiness detection and health monitoring that plays a pivotal role in contemporary society. This study delves into ER using electroencephalography (EEG), within immersive virtual reality (VR) environments. There are four main stages in our proposed methodology including data acquisition, pre-processing, feature extraction, and emotion classification. Acknowledging the limitations of existing 2D datasets, we introduce a groundbreaking 3D VR dataset to elevate the precision of emotion elicitation. Leveraging the Interaxon Muse headband for EEG recording and Oculus Quest 2 for VR stimuli, we meticulously recorded data from 40 participants, prioritizing subjects without reported mental illnesses. Pre-processing entails rigorous cleaning, uniform truncation, and the application of a Savitzky-Golay filter to the EEG data. Feature extraction encompasses a comprehensive analysis of metrics such as power spectral density, correlation, rational and divisional asymmetry, and power spectrum. To ensure the robustness of our model, we employed a 10-fold cross-validation, revealing an average validation accuracy of 85.54\%, with a noteworthy maximum accuracy of 90.20\% in the best fold. Subsequently, the trained model demonstrated a commendable test accuracy of 82.03\%, promising favorable outcomes.

**ABSTRACT**  
Molecular Relational Learning (MRL), aiming to understand interactions between molecular pairs, plays a pivotal role in advancing biochemical research. Recently, the adoption of large language models (LLMs), known for their vast knowledge repositories and advanced logical inference capabilities, has emerged as a promising way for efficient and effective MRL. Despite their potential, these methods predominantly rely on the textual data, thus not fully harnessing the wealth of structural information inherent in molecular graphs. Moreover, the absence of a unified framework exacerbates the information underutilization, as it hinders the sharing of interaction rationale learned across diverse datasets. To address these challenges, this work proposes a novel LLM-based multi-modal framework for Molecular inTeraction prediction following Chain-of-Thought (CoT) theory, termed MolTC, which can efficiently integrate rich graphical information of molecular pairs. For achieving a unified MRL, MolTC innovatively develops a dynamic parameter-sharing strategy for cross-dataset information exchange, and introduces a Multi-hierarchical CoT principle to refine training paradigm. Our experiments, conducted across twelve varied datasets involving over 4,000,000 molecular pairs, demonstrate the superiority of our method over current <b>GNN</b> and LLM-based baselines. On the top of that, a comprehensive Molecular Interactive Instructions dataset is constructed for the development of biochemical LLM, including our MolTC. Code is available at https://github.com/MangoKiller/MolTC.

**ABSTRACT**  
Bioinformatics has witnessed a paradigm shift with the increasing integration of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly through the adoption of foundation models (FMs). These AI techniques have rapidly advanced, addressing historical challenges in bioinformatics such as the scarcity of annotated data and the presence of data noise. FMs are particularly adept at handling large-scale, unlabeled data, a common scenario in biological contexts due to the time-consuming and costly nature of experimentally determining labeled data. This characteristic has allowed FMs to excel and achieve notable results in various downstream validation tasks, demonstrating their ability to represent diverse biological entities effectively. Undoubtedly, FMs have ushered in a new era in computational biology, especially in the realm of deep learning. The primary goal of this survey is to conduct a systematic investigation and summary of FMs in bioinformatics, tracing their evolution, current research status, and the methodologies employed. Central to our focus is the application of FMs to specific biological problems, aiming to guide the research community in choosing appropriate FMs for their research needs. We delve into the specifics of the problem at hand including sequence analysis, structure prediction, function annotation, and multimodal integration, comparing the structures and advancements against traditional methods. Furthermore, the review analyses challenges and limitations faced by FMs in biology, such as data noise, model explainability, and potential biases. Finally, we outline potential development paths and strategies for FMs in future biological research, setting the stage for continued innovation and application in this rapidly evolving field. This comprehensive review serves not only as an academic resource but also as a roadmap for future explorations and applications of FMs in biology.

**ABSTRACT**  
The <b>Convolutional</b> <b>Neural</b> <b>Network</b> (CNN) has emerged as a powerful and versatile tool for artificial intelligence (AI) applications. Conventional computing architectures face challenges in meeting the demanding processing requirements of compute-intensive <b>CNN</b> applications, as they suffer from limited throughput and low utilization. To this end, specialized accelerators have been developed to speed up <b>CNN</b> computations. However, as we demonstrate in this paper via extensive design space exploration, different neural network models have different characteristics, which calls for different accelerator architectures and configurations to match their computing demand. We show that a one-size-fits-all fixed architecture does not guarantee optimal power/energy/performance trade-off. To overcome this challenge, this paper proposes ARMAN, a novel reconfigurable systolic-array-based accelerator architecture based on Monolithic 3D (M3D) technology for <b>CNN</b> inference. The proposed accelerator offers the flexibility to reconfigure among different scale-up or scale-out arrangements depending on the neural network structure, providing the optimal trade-off across power, energy, and performance for various neural network models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through evaluations of multiple benchmarks. The results demonstrate that the proposed accelerator exhibits up to 2x, 2.24x, 1.48x, and 2x improvements in terms of execution cycles, power, energy, and EDP respectively, over the non-configurable architecture.

**ABSTRACT**  
In today's data centers, personalized <b>recommendation</b> systems face challenges such as the need for large memory capacity and high bandwidth, especially when performing embedding operations. Previous approaches have relied on DIMM-based near-memory processing techniques or introduced 3D-stacked DRAM to address memory-bound issues and expand memory bandwidth. However, these solutions fall short when dealing with the expanding size of personalized <b>recommendation</b> systems. <b>Recommendation</b> models have grown to sizes exceeding tens of terabytes, making them challenging to run efficiently on traditional single-node inference servers. Although various algorithmic methods have been proposed to reduce embedding table capacity, they often result in increased memory access or inefficient utilization of memory resources. This paper introduces HEAM, a heterogeneous memory architecture that integrates 3D-stacked DRAM with DIMM to accelerate <b>recommendation</b> systems in which compositional embedding is utilized-a technique aimed at reducing the size of embedding tables. The architecture is organized into a three-tier memory hierarchy consisting of conventional DIMM, 3D-stacked DRAM with a base die-level Processing-In-Memory (PIM), and a bank group-level PIM incorporating a Look-Up-Table. This setup is specifically designed to accommodate the unique aspects of compositional embedding, such as temporal locality and embedding table capacity. This design effectively reduces bank access, improves access efficiency, and enhances overall throughput, resulting in a 6.3 times speedup and 58.9% energy savings compared to the baseline.

**ABSTRACT**  
We live in the era of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI). Deepfakes and Large Language Models (LLMs) are two examples of GenAI. Deepfakes, in particular, pose an alarming threat to society as they are capable of spreading misinformation and changing the truth. LLMs are powerful language models that generate general-purpose language. However due to its generative aspect, it can also be a risk for people if used with ill intentions. The ethical use of these technologies is a big concern. This short article tries to find out the interrelationship between them.

**ABSTRACT**  
Large language models (LLMs) can pass explicit bias tests but still harbor implicit biases, similar to humans who endorse egalitarian beliefs yet exhibit subtle biases. Measuring such implicit biases can be a challenge: as LLMs become increasingly proprietary, it may not be possible to access their embeddings and apply existing bias measures; furthermore, implicit biases are primarily a concern if they affect the actual decisions that these systems make. We address both of these challenges by introducing two measures of bias inspired by psychology: <b>LLM</b> Implicit Association Test (IAT) Bias, which is a prompt-based method for revealing implicit bias; and <b>LLM</b> Decision Bias for detecting subtle discrimination in decision-making tasks. Using these measures, we found pervasive human-like stereotype biases in 6 LLMs across 4 social domains (race, gender, religion, health) and 21 categories (weapons, guilt, science, career among others). Our prompt-based measure of implicit bias correlates with embedding-based methods but better predicts downstream behaviors measured by <b>LLM</b> Decision Bias. This measure is based on asking the <b>LLM</b> to decide between individuals, motivated by psychological results indicating that relative not absolute evaluations are more related to implicit biases. Using prompt-based measures informed by psychology allows us to effectively expose nuanced biases and subtle discrimination in proprietary LLMs that do not show explicit bias on standard benchmarks.

**ABSTRACT**  
Intelligent agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated substantial promise in autonomously conducting experiments and facilitating scientific discoveries across various disciplines. While their capabilities are promising, they also introduce novel vulnerabilities that demand careful consideration for safety. However, there exists a notable gap in the literature, as there has been no comprehensive exploration of these vulnerabilities. This position paper fills this gap by conducting a thorough examination of vulnerabilities in LLM-based agents within scientific domains, shedding light on potential risks associated with their misuse and emphasizing the need for safety measures. We begin by providing a comprehensive overview of the potential risks inherent to scientific <b>LLM</b> agents, taking into account user intent, the specific scientific domain, and their potential impact on the external environment. Then, we delve into the origins of these vulnerabilities and provide a scoping review of the limited existing works. Based on our analysis, we propose a triadic framework involving human regulation, agent alignment, and an understanding of environmental feedback (agent regulation) to mitigate these identified risks. Furthermore, we highlight the limitations and challenges associated with safeguarding scientific agents and advocate for the development of improved models, robust benchmarks, and comprehensive regulations to address these issues effectively.

**ABSTRACT**  
As machine learning applications proliferate, we need an understanding of their potential for harm. However, current <b>fairness</b> metrics are rarely grounded in human psychological experiences of harm. Drawing on the social psychology of stereotypes, we use a case study of gender stereotypes in image search to examine how people react to machine learning errors. First, we use survey studies to show that not all machine learning errors reflect stereotypes nor are equally harmful. Then, in experimental studies we randomly expose participants to stereotype-reinforcing, -violating, and -neutral machine learning errors. We find stereotype-reinforcing errors induce more experientially (i.e., subjectively) harmful experiences, while having minimal changes to cognitive beliefs, attitudes, or behaviors. This experiential harm impacts women more than men. However, certain stereotype-violating errors are more experientially harmful for men, potentially due to perceived threats to masculinity. We conclude that harm cannot be the sole guide in <b>fairness</b> mitigation, and propose a nuanced perspective depending on who is experiencing what harm and why.

**ABSTRACT**  
Existing research on malware detection focuses almost exclusively on the detection rate. However, in some cases, it is also important to understand the results of our algorithm, or to obtain more information, such as where to investigate in the file for an analyst. In this aim, we propose a new model to analyze Portable Executable files. Our method consists in splitting the files in different sections, then transform each section into an image, in order to train convolutional neural networks to treat specifically each identified section. Then we use all these scores returned by CNNs to compute a final detection score, using models that enable us to improve our analysis of the importance of each section in the final score.

**ABSTRACT**  
In a zero-trust fabless paradigm, designers are increasingly concerned about hardware-based attacks on the semiconductor supply chain. Logic locking is a design-for-trust method that adds extra key-controlled gates in the circuits to prevent hardware intellectual property theft and overproduction. While attackers have traditionally relied on an oracle to attack logic-locked circuits, machine learning attacks have shown the ability to retrieve the secret key even without access to an oracle. In this paper, we first examine the limitations of state-of-the-art machine learning attacks and argue that the use of key hamming distance as the sole model-guiding structural metric is not always useful. Then, we develop, train, and test a corruptibility-aware graph neural network-based oracle-less attack on logic locking that takes into consideration both the structure and the behavior of the circuits. Our model is explainable in the sense that we analyze what the machine learning model has interpreted in the training process and how it can perform a successful attack. Chip designers may find this information beneficial in securing their designs while avoiding incremental fixes.

**ABSTRACT**  
Smartphones have become indispensable in our daily lives and can do almost everything, from communication to online shopping. However, with the increased usage, cybercrime aimed at mobile devices is rocketing. Smishing attacks, in particular, have observed a significant upsurge in recent years. This problem is further exacerbated by the perpetrator creating new deceptive websites daily, with an average life cycle of under 15 hours. This renders the standard practice of keeping a database of malicious URLs ineffective. To this end, we propose a novel on-device pipeline: COPS that intelligently identifies features of fraudulent messages and URLs to alert the user in real-time. COPS is a lightweight pipeline with a detection module based on the Disentangled <b>Variational</b> <b>Autoencoder</b> of size 3.46MB for smishing and URL phishing detection, and we benchmark it on open datasets. We achieve an accuracy of 98.15% and 99.5%, respectively, for both tasks, with a false negative and false positive rate of a mere 0.037 and 0.015, outperforming previous works with the added advantage of ensuring real-time alerts on resource-constrained devices.

**ABSTRACT**  
Sensing performance is typically evaluated by classical radar metrics, such as Cramer-Rao bound and signal-to-clutter-plus-noise ratio. The recent development of the integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) framework motivated the efforts to unify the performance metric for sensing and communication, where <b>mutual</b> <b>information</b> (MI) was proposed as a sensing performance metric with deterministic signals. However, the need of communication in ISAC systems necessitates the transmission of random signals for sensing applications, whereas an explicit evaluation for the sensing <b>mutual</b> <b>information</b> (SMI) with random signals is not yet available in the literature. This paper aims to fill the research gap and investigate the unification of sensing and communication performance metrics. For that purpose, we first derive the explicit expression for the SMI with random signals utilizing random matrix theory. On top of that, we further build up the connections between SMI and traditional sensing metrics, such as ergodic minimum mean square error (EMMSE), ergodic linear minimum mean square error (ELMMSE), and ergodic Bayesian Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound (EBCRB). Such connections open up the opportunity to unify sensing and communication performance metrics, which facilitates the analysis and design for ISAC systems. Finally, SMI is utilized to optimize the precoder for both sensing-only and ISAC applications. <b>Simulation</b> results validate the accuracy of the theoretical results and the effectiveness of the proposed precoding designs.

**ABSTRACT**  
In Vehicle-to-Everything networks that involve multi-hop communication, the Road Side Units (RSUs) typically aim to collect location information from the participating vehicles to provide security and network diagnostics features. While the vehicles commonly use the Global Positioning System (GPS) for navigation, they may refrain from sharing their precise GPS coordinates with the RSUs due to privacy concerns. Therefore, to jointly address the high localization requirements by the RSUs as well as the vehicles' privacy, we present a novel spatial-provenance framework wherein each vehicle uses <b>Bloom</b> filters to embed their partial location information when forwarding the packets. In this framework, the RSUs and the vehicles agree upon fragmenting the coverage area into several smaller regions so that the vehicles can embed the identity of their regions through <b>Bloom</b> filters. Given the probabilistic nature of <b>Bloom</b> filters, we derive an analytical expression on the error-rates in provenance recovery and then pose an optimization problem to choose the underlying parameters. With the help of extensive <b>simulation</b> results, we show that our method offers near-optimal <b>Bloom</b> filter parameters in learning spatial provenance. Some interesting trade-offs between the communication-overhead, spatial privacy of the vehicles and the error rates in provenance recovery are also discussed.

**ABSTRACT**  
Large language models (LLMs) have recently gained much popularity due to their surprising ability at generating human-like English sentences. LLMs are essentially predictors, estimating the probability of a sequence of words given the past. Therefore, it is natural to evaluate their performance from a universal prediction perspective. In order to do that fairly, we introduce the notion of batch regret as a modification of the classical average regret, and we study its asymptotical value for add-constant predictors, in the case of memoryless sources and first-order Markov sources.

**ABSTRACT**  
Approximate message passing (AMP) algorithms are devised under the Gaussianity assumption of the measurement noise vector. In this work, we relax this assumption within the vector AMP (VAMP) framework to arbitrary independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) noise priors. We do so by rederiving the linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) to accommodate both the noise and signal estimations within the message passing steps of VAMP. Numerical results demonstrate how our proposed algorithm handles non-Gaussian noise models as compared to VAMP. This extension to general noise priors enables the use of AMP algorithms in a wider range of engineering applications where non-Gaussian noise models are more appropriate.

**ABSTRACT**  
The increasing demand for data storage has prompted the exploration of new techniques, with molecular data storage being a promising alternative. In this work, we develop coding schemes for a new storage paradigm that can be represented as a collection of two-dimensional arrays. Motivated by error patterns observed in recent prototype architectures, our study focuses on correcting erasures in the last few symbols of each row, and also correcting arbitrary deletions across rows. We present code constructions and explicit encoders and decoders that are shown to be nearly optimal in many scenarios. We show that the new coding schemes are capable of effectively mitigating these errors, making these emerging storage platforms potentially promising solutions.

**ABSTRACT**  
Multi-antenna relays and intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) have been utilized to construct favorable channels to improve the performance of wireless systems. A common feature between relay systems and IRS-aided systems is the two-hop multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel. As a result, the <b>mutual</b> <b>information</b> (MI) of two-hop MIMO channels has been widely investigated with very engaging results. However, a rigorous investigation on the fundamental limits of two-hop MIMO channels, i.e., the first and second-order analysis, is not yet available in the literature, due to the difficulties caused by the two-hop (product) channel and the noise introduced by the relay (active IRS). In this paper, we employ large-scale random matrix theory (RMT), specifically Gaussian tools, to derive the closed-form deterministic approximation for the mean and variance of the MI. Additionally, we determine the convergence rate for the mean, variance and the characteristic function of the MI, and prove the asymptotic Gaussianity. Furthermore, we also investigate the analytical properties of the fundamental equations that describe the closed-form approximation and prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution. An iterative algorithm is then proposed to obtain the solution for the fundamental equations. Numerical results validate the accuracy of the theoretical analysis.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this paper we address the following question: How can we use Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve code independently of a human, while ensuring that the improved code - does not regress the properties of the original code? - improves the original in a verifiable and measurable way? To address this question, we advocate Assured LLM-Based Software Engineering; a generate-and-test approach, inspired by Genetic Improvement. Assured LLMSE applies a series of semantic filters that discard code that fails to meet these twin guarantees. This overcomes the potential problem of LLM's propensity to hallucinate. It allows us to generate code using LLMs, independently of any human. The human plays the role only of final code reviewer, as they would do with code generated by other human engineers. This paper is an outline of the content of the keynote by Mark Harman at the International Workshop on Interpretability, Robustness, and Benchmarking in Neural Software Engineering, Monday 15th April 2024, Lisbon, Portugal.

**ABSTRACT**  
CodeCompose is an AI-assisted code authoring tool powered by large language models (LLMs) that provides inline suggestions to 10's of thousands of developers at Meta. In this paper, we present how we scaled the product from displaying single-line suggestions to multi-line suggestions. This evolution required us to overcome several unique challenges in improving the usability of these suggestions for developers. First, we discuss how multi-line suggestions can have a 'jarring' effect, as the LLM's suggestions constantly move around the developer's existing code, which would otherwise result in decreased productivity and satisfaction. Second, multi-line suggestions take significantly longer to generate; hence we present several innovative investments we made to reduce the perceived latency for users. These model-hosting optimizations sped up multi-line suggestion latency by 2.5x. Finally, we conduct experiments on 10's of thousands of engineers to understand how multi-line suggestions impact the user experience and contrast this with single-line suggestions. Our experiments reveal that (i) multi-line suggestions account for 42% of total characters accepted (despite only accounting for 16% for displayed suggestions) (ii) multi-line suggestions almost doubled the percentage of keystrokes saved for users from 9% to 17%. Multi-line CodeCompose has been rolled out to all engineers at Meta, and less than 1% of engineers have opted out of multi-line suggestions.

**ABSTRACT**  
Software patches are pivotal in refining and evolving codebases, addressing bugs, vulnerabilities, and optimizations. Patch descriptions provide detailed accounts of changes, aiding comprehension and collaboration among developers. However, manual description creation poses challenges in terms of time consumption and variations in quality and detail. In this paper, we propose PATCHEXPLAINER, an approach that addresses these challenges by framing patch description generation as a <b>machine</b> <b>translation</b> task. In PATCHEXPLAINER, we leverage explicit representations of critical elements, historical context, and syntactic conventions. Moreover, the translation model in PATCHEXPLAINER is designed with an awareness of description similarity. Particularly, the model is explicitly trained to recognize and incorporate similarities present in patch descriptions clustered into groups, improving its ability to generate accurate and consistent descriptions across similar patches. The dual objectives maximize similarity and accurately predict affiliating groups. Our experimental results on a large dataset of real-world software patches show that PATCHEXPLAINER consistently outperforms existing methods, with improvements up to 189% in BLEU, 5.7X in Exact Match rate, and 154% in Semantic Similarity, affirming its effectiveness in generating software patch descriptions.

**ABSTRACT**  
Modern code review is a critical quality assurance process that is widely adopted in both industry and open source software environments. This process can help newcomers learn from the feedback of experienced reviewers; however, it often brings a large workload and stress to reviewers. To alleviate this burden, the field of automated code reviews aims to automate the process, teaching large language models to provide reviews on submitted code, just as a human would. A recent approach pre-trained and fine-tuned the code intelligent language model on a large-scale code review corpus. However, such techniques did not fully utilise quality reviews amongst the training data. Indeed, reviewers with a higher level of experience or familiarity with the code will likely provide deeper insights than the others. In this study, we set out to investigate whether higher-quality reviews can be generated from automated code review models that are trained based on an experience-aware oversampling technique. Through our quantitative and qualitative evaluation, we find that experience-aware oversampling can increase the correctness, level of information, and meaningfulness of reviews generated by the current state-of-the-art model without introducing new data. The results suggest that a vast amount of high-quality reviews are underutilised with current training strategies. This work sheds light on resource-efficient ways to boost automated code review models.

**ABSTRACT**  
Issue tracking systems serve as the primary tool for incorporating external users and customizing a software project to meet the users' requirements. However, the limited number of contributors and the challenge of identifying the best approach for each issue often impede effective resolution. Recently, an increasing number of developers are turning to AI tools like <b>ChatGPT</b> to enhance problem-solving efficiency. While previous studies have demonstrated the potential of <b>ChatGPT</b> in areas such as automatic program repair, debugging, and code generation, there is a lack of study on how developers explicitly utilize <b>ChatGPT</b> to resolve issues in their tracking system. Hence, this study aims to examine the interaction between <b>ChatGPT</b> and developers to analyze their prevalent activities and provide a resolution. In addition, we assess the code reliability by confirming if the code produced by <b>ChatGPT</b> was integrated into the project's codebase using the clone detection tool NiCad. Our investigation reveals that developers mainly use <b>ChatGPT</b> for brainstorming solutions but often opt to write their code instead of using ChatGPT-generated code, possibly due to concerns over the generation of "hallucinated code", as highlighted in the literature.

**ABSTRACT**  
Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in code completion, as evidenced by their essential roles in developing code assistant services such as Copilot. Being trained on in-file contexts, current LLMs are quite effective in completing code for single source files. However, it is challenging for them to conduct repository-level code completion for large software projects that require cross-file information. Existing research on LLM-based repository-level code completion identifies and integrates cross-file contexts, but it suffers from low accuracy and limited context length of LLMs. In this paper, we argue that Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) can provide direct, accurate and real-time cross-file information for repository-level code completion. We propose IDECoder, a practical framework that leverages IDE native static contexts for cross-context construction and diagnosis results for self-refinement. IDECoder utilizes the rich cross-context information available in IDEs to enhance the capabilities of LLMs of repository-level code completion. We conducted preliminary experiments to validate the performance of IDECoder and observed that this synergy represents a promising trend for future exploration.

**ABSTRACT**  
Pre-trained Code Language Models (Code-PLMs) have shown many advancements and achieved state-of-the-art results for many software engineering tasks in the past few years. These models are mainly targeted for popular programming languages such as Java and Python, leaving out many other ones like R. Though R has a wide community of developers and users, there is little known about the applicability of Code-PLMs for R. In this preliminary study, we aim to investigate the vulnerability of Code-PLMs for code entities in R. For this purpose, we use an R dataset of code and comment pairs and then apply CodeAttack, a black-box attack model that uses the structure of code to generate adversarial code samples. We investigate how the model can attack different entities in R. This is the first step towards understanding the importance of R token types, compared to popular programming languages (e.g., Java). We limit our study to code summarization. Our results show that the most vulnerable code entity is the identifier, followed by some syntax tokens specific to R. The results can shed light on the importance of token types and help in developing models for code <b>summarization</b> and method name prediction for the R language.

**ABSTRACT**  
Backhaul traffic congestion caused by the video traffic of a few popular files can be alleviated by storing the to-be-requested content at various levels in wireless video caching networks. Typically, content service providers (CSPs) own the content, and the users request their preferred content from the CSPs using their (wireless) internet service providers (ISPs). As these parties do not reveal their private information and business secrets, traditional techniques may not be readily used to predict the dynamic changes in users' future demands. Motivated by this, we propose a novel resource-aware hierarchical federated learning (RawHFL) solution for predicting user's future content requests. A practical data acquisition technique is used that allows the user to update its local training dataset based on its requested content. Besides, since networking and other computational resources are limited, considering that only a subset of the users participate in the model training, we derive the convergence bound of the proposed algorithm. Based on this bound, we minimize a weighted utility function for jointly configuring the controllable parameters to train the RawHFL energy efficiently under practical resource constraints. Our extensive <b>simulation</b> results validate the proposed algorithm's superiority, in terms of test accuracy and energy cost, over existing baselines.

**ABSTRACT**  
The network flow watermarking technique associates the two communicating parties by actively modifying certain characteristics of the stream generated by the sender so that it covertly carries some special marking information. Some curious users communicating with the hidden server as a Tor client may attempt de-anonymization attacks to uncover the real identity of the hidden server by using this technique. This compromises the privacy of the anonymized communication system. Therefore, we propose a defense scheme against flow watermarking. The scheme is based on deep neural networks and utilizes generative adversarial networks to convert the original Inter-Packet Delays (IPD) into new IPDs generated by the model. We also adopt the concept of adversarial attacks to ensure that the detector will produce an incorrect classification when detecting these new IPDs. This approach ensures that these IPDs are considered "clean", effectively covering the potential watermarks. This scheme is effective against time-based flow watermarking techniques.

**ABSTRACT**  
We propose a synthesis method for the design of digital twins applicable to various systems (pneumatic, hydraulic, electrical/electronic circuits). The methodology allows representing the operation of these systems through an active digital twin, thereby enabling a more suitable and easier computer-aided design, simulation, control, and monitoring. Furthermore, our methodology enables the detection of a system's actions on its own inputs (for example, in pneumatics: backflow of gases trapped in part of a fluidic system onto its own inputs). During the <b>simulation</b> or monitoring phase, the approach also facilitates real-time diagnosis of the controlled system. The outputs, on the controlled physical system or its digital twin, do not depend only on the current inputs but also on the history of the inputs and the history of internal states and variables. In other words, the underlying sequential logic has a memory while an only combinational logic approach does not. These capabilities can contribute to the digital transformation of the factory of the future.

**ABSTRACT**  
Speed responses of motors, especially Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors (PMSMs), are increasing in importance for recent applications, such as electric vehicles or quadrotors. These applications require quick acceleration performance. However, commercial controllers are based mainly on Proportional-Integral (PI) controllers, which are suitable for eliminating steady-state errors but unsuitable for transient response optimization. In this paper, we replaced whole conventional controllers with an end-to-end <b>Recurrent</b> <b>Neural</b> <b>Network</b> (RNN) that has a regularized transition matrix. Our end-to-end controller directly minimizes the transient response time on the basis of optimal control theory. Computer-simulated results show that speed response indices improved using the <b>RNN</b> rather than a PI controller, while both were under comparable power losses. The current vector trajectories of the <b>RNN</b> showed that the <b>RNN</b> could automatically determine arbitrary trajectories in the flux-weakening region in accordance with an arbitrarily designed loss function. In contrast, the traditional flux-weakening methods using PI controllers have pre-determined current vector trajectories.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper addresses the particularities of adaptive optimal control of the uranium extraction-scrubbing operation in the PUREX process. The process dynamics are nonlinear, high dimensional, and have limited online measurements. In addition, analysis and developments are based on a qualified <b>simulation</b> program called PAREX, which was validated with laboratory and industrial data. The control objective is to stabilize the process at a desired solvent saturation level, guaranteeing constraints and handling disturbances. The developed control strategy relies on optimization-based methods for computing control inputs and estimates, i.e., Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) and Nonlinear Moving Horizon Estimation (NMHE). The designs of these two associated algorithms are tailored for this process's particular dynamics and are implemented through an enhanced Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to guarantee constraint satisfaction. Software-in-the-loop simulations using PAREX show that the designed control scheme effectively satisfies control objectives and guarantees constraints during operation.

**ABSTRACT**  
Increasing amount of wildfires in recent years consistently challenges the safe and reliable operations of power systems. To prevent power lines and other electrical components from causing wildfires under extreme conditions, electric utilities often deploy public safety power shutoffs (PSPS) to mitigate the wildfire risks therein. Although PSPS are effective countermeasures against wildfires, uncoordinated strategies can cause disruptions in electricity supply and even lead to cascading failures. Meanwhile, it is extremely important to consider mitigating biased decisions on different communities and populations during the implementation of shutoff actions. In this work, we primarily focus on the dynamic reconfiguration problem of networked microgrids with distributed energy resources. In particular, we formulate a rolling horizon optimization problem allowing for flexible network reconfiguration at each time interval to mitigate wildfire risks. To promote equity and <b>fairness</b> during the span of shutoffs, we further enforce a range of constraints associated with load shedding to discourage disproportionate impact on individual load blocks. Numerical studies on the modified IEEE 13-bus system and a larger-sized Smart-DS system demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm towards more equitable power shutoff operations.

**ABSTRACT**  
Stratospheric balloons have emerged as an affordable and flexible alternative to traditional spacecrafts as they are implemented using commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) equipment without following strict methodologies. HERCCULES is a stratospheric balloon mission that aims to characterize the convective heat and radiative environment in the stratosphere. The purpose of this article is to present the HERCCULES onboard software (OBSW) whose design and complexity is comparable to that of satellite systems, since it must control about sixty COTS equipment using a single Raspberry Pi 4B as onboard computer and ensure the real-time requirements. Compared to similar systems, novel contributions are presented as the OBSW is developed following modelbased and component-based approaches using the TASTE toolchain from the European Space Agency (ESA) for automatic code generation. Besides, the OBSW is verified and validated following the ESA standards and the results obtained demonstrate the suitability and efficiency of the solution and the selected methodologies.

**ABSTRACT**  
Data-driven predictive control promises modelfree wave-dampening strategies for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) in mixed traffic flow. However, the performance suffers from unknown noise and disturbances, which could occur in offline data collection and online predictive control. In this paper, we propose a Robust Data-EnablEd Predictive Leading Cruise Control (RDeeP-LCC) method based on reachability analysis, aiming to achieve safe and optimal control of CAVs under bounded process noise and external disturbances. Precisely, we decouple the mixed platoon system into an error system and a nominal system, and tighten the constraint via the data-driven reachable set technique. Then, the enhanced safety constraint is integrated with the data-driven predictive control formulation to achieve stronger robust control performance for CAVs. Simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in mitigating traffic waves with better robustness.

**ABSTRACT**  
We study the approximation by a Voronoi finite-volume scheme of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation with time-dependent potential in two and three dimensions. We perform an explicit splitting scheme for the time integration alongside a two-point flux approximation scheme in space. We rigorously analyze the error bounds relying on discrete uniform Sobolev inequalities. We also prove the convergence of the pseudo-vorticity of the wave function. We finally perform some numerical simulations to illustrate our theoretical results.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this paper, we consider the numerical approximation of a time-fractional stochastic Cahn--Hilliard equation driven by an additive fractionally integrated Gaussian noise. The model involves a Caputo fractional derivative in time of order $\alpha\in(0,1)$ and a fractional time-integral noise of order $\gamma\in[0,1]$. The numerical scheme approximates the model by a piecewise linear finite element method in space and a <b>convolution</b> quadrature in time (for both time-fractional operators), along with the $L^2$-projection for the noise. We carefully investigate the spatially semidiscrete and fully discrete schemes, and obtain strong convergence rates by using clever energy arguments. The temporal H\"older continuity property of the solution played a key role in the error analysis. Unlike the stochastic Allen--Cahn equation, the presence of the unbounded elliptic operator in front of the cubic nonlinearity in the underlying model adds complexity and challenges to the error analysis. To overcome these difficulties, several new techniques and error estimates are developed. The study concludes with numerical examples that validate the theoretical findings.

**ABSTRACT**  
Academic achievement is a critical measure of intellectual ability, prompting extensive research into cognitive tasks as potential predictors. Neuroimaging technologies, such as functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), offer insights into brain hemodynamics, allowing understanding of the link between cognitive performance and academic achievement. Herein, we explored the association between cognitive tasks and academic achievement by analyzing prefrontal fNIRS signals. A novel quantum annealer (QA) feature selection algorithm was applied to fNIRS data to identify cognitive tasks correlated with CSAT scores. Twelve features (signal mean, median, variance, peak, number of peaks, sum of peaks, slope, minimum, kurtosis, skewness, standard deviation, and root mean square) were extracted from fNIRS signals at two time windows (10- and 60-second) to compare results from various feature variable conditions. The feature selection results from the QA-based and XGBoost regressor algorithms were compared to validate the former's performance. In a three-step validation process using multiple linear regression models, correlation coefficients between the feature variables and the CSAT scores, model fitness (adjusted R2), and model prediction error (RMSE) values were calculated. The quantum annealer demonstrated comparable performance to classical machine learning models, and specific cognitive tasks, including verbal fluency, recognition, and the Corsi block tapping task, were correlated with academic achievement. Group analyses revealed stronger associations between Tower of London and N-back tasks with higher CSAT scores. Quantum annealing algorithms have significant potential in feature selection using fNIRS data, and represents a novel research approach. Future studies should explore predictors of academic achievement and cognitive ability.

**ABSTRACT**  
A confidence sequence (CS) is a sequence of confidence sets that contains a target parameter of an underlying stochastic process at any time step with high probability. This paper proposes a new approach to constructing CSs for means of bounded multivariate stochastic processes using a general gambling framework, extending the recently established coin toss framework for bounded random processes. The proposed gambling framework provides a general recipe for constructing CSs for categorical and probability-vector-valued observations, as well as for general bounded multidimensional observations through a simple reduction. This paper specifically explores the use of the mixture portfolio, akin to Cover's universal portfolio, in the proposed framework and investigates the properties of the resulting CSs. Simulations demonstrate the tightness of these confidence sequences compared to existing methods. When applied to the sampling without-replacement setting for finite categorical data, it is shown that the resulting CS based on a universal gambling strategy is provably tighter than that of the posterior-prior ratio martingale proposed by Waudby-Smith and Ramdas.

**ABSTRACT**  
As Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) become popular, libraries like PyTorch-Geometric (PyG) and Deep Graph Library (DGL) are proposed; these libraries have emerged as the de facto standard for implementing GNNs because they provide graph-oriented APIs and are purposefully designed to manage the inherent sparsity and irregularity in graph structures. However, these libraries show poor scalability on multi-core processors, which under-utilizes the available platform resources and limits the performance. This is because <b>GNN</b> training is a resource-intensive workload with high volume of irregular data accessing, and existing libraries fail to utilize the memory bandwidth efficiently. To address this challenge, we propose ARGO, a novel runtime system for <b>GNN</b> training that offers scalable performance. ARGO exploits multi-processing and core-binding techniques to improve platform resource utilization. We further develop an auto-tuner that searches for the optimal configuration for multi-processing and core-binding. The auto-tuner works automatically, making it completely transparent from the user. Furthermore, the auto-tuner allows ARGO to adapt to various platforms, <b>GNN</b> models, datasets, etc. We evaluate ARGO on two representative <b>GNN</b> models and four widely-used datasets on two platforms. With the proposed autotuner, ARGO is able to select a near-optimal configuration by exploring only 5% of the design space. ARGO speeds up state-of-the-art <b>GNN</b> libraries by up to 5.06x and 4.54x on a four-socket Ice Lake machine with 112 cores and a two-socket Sapphire Rapids machine with 64 cores, respectively. Finally, ARGO can seamlessly integrate into widely-used <b>GNN</b> libraries (e.g., DGL, PyG) with few lines of code and speed up <b>GNN</b> training.

**ABSTRACT**  
Efficient distributed training serves as a powerful catalyst and an essential foundation for the development of large-scale neural networks. In distributed training scenarios, various pipeline parallelism methods are cleverly designed and widely employed. In this paper, we propose ZeroPP, a highly efficient and flexible pipeline parallelism method that trades off pipeline bubbles, memory usage, and communication through adaptive scheduling units. ZeroPP achieves minimal pipeline bubbles by carefully staggering the computation tasks of forward, input gradient, and weight gradient within a scheduling unit. Additionally, ZeroPP optimizes the combination of pipeline parallelism and fully sharded data parallelism using a blockwise schedule. We conduct experiments with popular GPT-style models and observe up to a 30% increase in throughput compared to the state-of-the-art breath-first pipeline parallelism. Besides, our evaluation also demonstrates up to a 68% increase in throughput and a 10% reduction in memory consumption compared to the memory-efficient 1F1B method.

**ABSTRACT**  
Triangle counting in a graph is a fundamental problem and has a wide range of applications in various domains. It is crucial in understanding the structural properties of a graph and is often used as a building block for more complex graph analytics. In this paper, we solve the triangle counting problem in an anonymous graph in a distributed setting using mobile agents and subsequently use this as a subroutine to tackle the truss decomposition and triangle centrality problem. The paper employs mobile agents, placed on the nodes of the graph to coordinate among themselves to solve the triangle enumeration problem for the graph. Following the literature, we consider the synchronous systems where each robot executes its tasks concurrently with all others and hence time complexity can be measured as the number of rounds needed to complete the task. The graph is anonymous, i.e., without any node labels or IDs, but the agents are autonomous with distinct IDs and have limited memory. Agents can only communicate with other agents locally i.e., if and only if they are at the same node. The goal is to devise algorithms that minimise both the time required for triangle counting and the memory usage at each agent. We further demonstrate how the triangle count obtained through the mobile agent approach can be leveraged to address the truss decomposition, triangle centrality and local clustering coefficient problems, which involves finding maximal sub-graphs with strong interconnections. Truss decomposition helps in identifying maximal, highly interconnected sub-graphs, or trusses, within a network, thus, revealing the structural cohesion and tight-knit communities in complex graphs, facilitating the analysis of relationships and information flow in various fields, such as social networks, biology, and <b>recommendation</b> systems.

**ABSTRACT**  
This study introduces a novel machine learning framework, integrating domain knowledge, to accurately predict the bearing capacity of CFSTs, bridging the gap between traditional engineering and machine learning techniques. Utilizing a comprehensive database of 2621 experimental data points on CFSTs, we developed a Domain Knowledge Enhanced Neural Network (DKNN) model. This model incorporates advanced feature engineering techniques, including Pearson correlation, XGBoost, and Random tree algorithms. The DKNN model demonstrated a marked improvement in prediction accuracy, with a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) reduction of over 50% compared to existing models. Its robustness was confirmed through extensive performance assessments, maintaining high accuracy even in noisy environments. Furthermore, sensitivity and SHAP analysis were conducted to assess the contribution of each effective parameter to axial load capacity and propose design recommendations for the diameter of cross-section, material strength range and material combination. This research advances CFST predictive modelling, showcasing the potential of integrating machine learning with domain expertise in structural engineering. The DKNN model sets a new benchmark for accuracy and reliability in the field.

**ABSTRACT**  
We study the problem of fairly assigning a set of discrete tasks (or chores) among a set of agents with additive valuations. Each chore is associated with a start and finish time, and each agent can perform at most one chore at any given time. The goal is to find a fair and efficient schedule of the chores, where <b>fairness</b> pertains to satisfying envy-freeness up to one chore (EF1) and efficiency pertains to maximality (i.e., no unallocated chore can be feasibly assigned to any agent). Our main result is a polynomial-time algorithm for computing an EF1 and maximal schedule for two agents under monotone valuations when the conflict constraints constitute an arbitrary interval graph. The algorithm uses a coloring technique in interval graphs that may be of independent interest. For an arbitrary number of agents, we provide an algorithm for finding a fair schedule under identical dichotomous valuations when the constraints constitute a path graph. We also show that stronger <b>fairness</b> and efficiency properties, including envy-freeness up to any chore (EFX) along with maximality and EF1 along with Pareto optimality, cannot be achieved.

**ABSTRACT**  
The core is a central solution concept in cooperative game theory, defined as the set of feasible allocations or payments such that no subset of agents has incentive to break away and form their own subgroup or coalition. However, it has long been known that the core (and approximations, such as the least-core) are hard to compute. This limits our ability to analyze cooperative games in general, and to fully embrace cooperative game theory contributions in domains such as <b>explainable</b> <b>AI</b> (XAI), where the core can complement the Shapley values to identify influential features or instances supporting predictions by black-box models. We propose novel iterative algorithms for computing variants of the core, which avoid the computational bottleneck of many other approaches; namely solving large linear programs. As such, they scale better to very large problems as we demonstrate across different classes of cooperative games, including weighted voting games, induced subgraph games, and marginal contribution networks. We also explore our algorithms in the context of XAI, providing further evidence of the power of the core for such applications.

**ABSTRACT**  
Single Transferable Vote (STV) elections are a principled approach to electing multiple candidates in a single election. Each ballot has a starting value of 1, and a candidate is elected if they gather a total vote value more than a defined quota. Votes over the quota have their value reduced by a transfer value so as to remove the quota, and are passed to the next candidate on the ballot. Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) are a statistically sound approach to election auditing which guarantees that failure to detect an error in the result is bounded by a limit. A first approach to RLAs for 2-seat STV elections has been defined. In this paper we show how we can improve this approach by <b>reasoning</b> about lower bounds on transfer values, and how we can extend the approach to partially audit an election, if the method does not support a full audit.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper proposes a mechanism to accelerate and optimize the energy consumption of a face detection software based on Haar-like cascading classifiers, taking advantage of the features of low-cost Asymmetric Multicore Processors (AMPs) with limited power budget. A modelling and task scheduling/allocation is proposed in order to efficiently make use of the existing features on big.LITTLE ARM processors, including: (I) source-code adaptation for parallel computing, which enables code acceleration by applying the OmpSs programming model, a task-based programming model that handles data-dependencies between tasks in a transparent fashion; (II) different OmpSs task allocation policies which take into account the processor asymmetry and can dynamically set processing resources in a more efficient way based on their particular features. The proposed mechanism can be efficiently applied to take advantage of the processing elements existing on low-cost and low-energy multi-core embedded devices executing <b>object</b> <b>detection</b> algorithms based on cascading classifiers. Although these classifiers yield the best results for detection algorithms in the field of computer vision, their high computational requirements prevent them from being used on these devices under real-time requirements. Finally, we compare the energy efficiency of a heterogeneous architecture based on asymmetric multicore processors with a suitable task scheduling, with that of a homogeneous symmetric architecture.

**ABSTRACT**  
The Adaptive Momentum Estimation (Adam) algorithm is highly effective in training various deep learning tasks. Despite this, there's limited theoretical understanding for Adam, especially when focusing on its vanilla form in non-convex smooth scenarios with potential unbounded gradients and affine variance noise. In this paper, we study vanilla Adam under these challenging conditions. We introduce a comprehensive noise model which governs affine variance noise, bounded noise and sub-Gaussian noise. We show that Adam can find a stationary point with a $\mathcal{O}(\text{poly}(\log T)/\sqrt{T})$ rate in high probability under this general noise model where $T$ denotes total number iterations, matching the lower rate of stochastic first-order algorithms up to logarithm factors. More importantly, we reveal that Adam is free of tuning step-sizes with any problem-parameters, yielding a better adaptation property than the <b>Stochastic</b> <b>Gradient</b> <b>Descent</b> under the same conditions. We also provide a probabilistic convergence result for Adam under a generalized smooth condition which allows unbounded smoothness parameters and has been illustrated empirically to more accurately capture the smooth property of many practical objective functions.

**ABSTRACT**  
Multi-agent deep <b>reinforcement</b> <b>learning</b> (MADRL) problems often encounter the challenge of sparse rewards. This challenge becomes even more pronounced when coordination among agents is necessary. As performance depends not only on one agent's behavior but rather on the joint behavior of multiple agents, finding an adequate solution becomes significantly harder. In this context, a group of agents can benefit from actively exploring different joint strategies in order to determine the most efficient one. In this paper, we propose an approach for rewarding strategies where agents collectively exhibit novel behaviors. We present JIM (Joint Intrinsic Motivation), a multi-agent intrinsic motivation method that follows the centralized learning with decentralized execution paradigm. JIM rewards joint trajectories based on a centralized measure of novelty designed to function in continuous environments. We demonstrate the strengths of this approach both in a synthetic environment designed to reveal shortcomings of state-of-the-art MADRL methods, and in simulated robotic tasks. Results show that joint exploration is crucial for solving tasks where the optimal strategy requires a high level of coordination.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this work, we solve the problem of finding the best locations to place stations for depositing/collecting shared bicycles. To do this, we model the problem as the p-median problem, that is a major existing localization problem in optimization. The p-median problem seeks to place a set of facilities (bicycle stations) in a way that minimizes the distance between a set of clients (citizens) and their closest facility (bike station). We have used a genetic algorithm, iterated local search, particle swarm optimization, simulated annealing, and variable neighbourhood search, to find the best locations for the bicycle stations and study their comparative advantages. We use irace to parameterize each algorithm automatically, to contribute with a methodology to <b>fine-tune</b> algorithms automatically. We have also studied different real data (distance and weights) from diverse open data sources from a real city, Malaga (Spain), hopefully leading to a final smart city application. We have compared our results with the implemented solution in Malaga. Finally, we have analyzed how we can use our proposal to improve the existing system in the city by adding more stations.

**ABSTRACT**  
Spanning over two decades, the study of qubits in semiconductors for quantum computing has yielded significant breakthroughs. However, the development of large-scale semiconductor quantum circuits is still limited by challenges in efficiently tuning and operating these circuits. Identifying optimal operating conditions for these qubits is complex, involving the exploration of vast parameter spaces. This presents a real 'needle in the haystack' problem, which, until now, has resisted complete automation due to device variability and fabrication imperfections. In this study, we present the first fully autonomous tuning of a semiconductor qubit, from a grounded device to Rabi oscillations, a clear indication of successful qubit operation. We demonstrate this automation, achieved without human intervention, in a Ge/Si core/shell nanowire device. Our approach integrates deep learning, Bayesian optimization, and computer vision techniques. We expect this automation algorithm to apply to a wide range of semiconductor qubit devices, allowing for statistical studies of qubit quality metrics. As a demonstration of the potential of full automation, we characterise how the Rabi frequency and g-factor depend on barrier gate voltages for one of the qubits found by the algorithm. Twenty years after the initial demonstrations of spin qubit operation, this significant advancement is poised to finally catalyze the operation of large, previously unexplored quantum circuits.

**ABSTRACT**  
Geometric quantum machine learning (GQML) aims to embed problem symmetries for learning efficient solving protocols. However, the question remains if (G)QML can be routinely used for constructing protocols with an exponential separation from classical analogs. In this Letter we consider Simon's problem for learning properties of Boolean functions, and show that this can be related to an <b>unsupervised</b> circuit classification problem. Using the workflow of geometric QML, we learn from first principles Simon's algorithm, thus discovering an example of BQP$^A\neq$BPP protocol with respect to some dataset (oracle $A$). Our key findings include the development of an equivariant feature map for embedding Boolean functions, based on twirling with respect to identified bitflip and permutational symmetries, and measurement based on invariant observables with a sampling advantage. The proposed workflow points to the importance of data embeddings and classical post-processing, while keeping the variational circuit as a trivial identity operator. Next, developing the intuition for the function learning, we visualize instances as directed computational hypergraphs, and observe that the GQML protocol can access their global topological features for distinguishing bijective and surjective functions. Finally, we discuss the prospects for learning other BQP$^A$-type protocols, and conjecture that this depends on the ability of simplifying embeddings-based oracles $A$ applied as a linear combination of unitaries.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper explores the integration of Explainable Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) in the realm of financial engineering, specifically focusing on its application in credit decision-making. The rapid evolution of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in finance has necessitated a balance between sophisticated algorithmic decision-making and the need for transparency in these systems. The focus is on how AutoML can streamline the development of robust machine learning models for credit scoring, while <b>Explainable</b> <b>AI</b> (XAI) methods, particularly SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), provide insights into the models' decision-making processes. This study demonstrates how the combination of AutoML and XAI not only enhances the efficiency and accuracy of credit decisions but also fosters trust and collaboration between humans and AI systems. The findings underscore the potential of explainable AutoML in improving the transparency and accountability of AI-driven financial decisions, aligning with regulatory requirements and ethical considerations.

**ABSTRACT**  
The Maximum s-Bundle Problem (MBP) addresses the task of identifying a maximum s-bundle in a given graph. A graph G=(V, E) is called an s-bundle if its vertex connectivity is at least |V|-s, where the vertex connectivity equals the minimum number of vertices whose deletion yields a disconnected or trivial graph. MBP is NP-hard and holds relevance in numerous realworld scenarios emphasizing the vertex connectivity. Exact algorithms for MBP mainly follow the branch-and-bound (BnB) framework, whose performance heavily depends on the quality of the upper bound on the cardinality of a maximum s-bundle and the initial lower bound with graph reduction. In this work, we introduce a novel Partition-based Upper Bound (PUB) that leverages the graph partitioning technique to achieve a tighter upper bound compared to existing ones. To increase the lower bound, we propose to do short random walks on a clique to generate larger initial solutions. Then, we propose a new BnB algorithm that uses the initial lower bound and PUB in preprocessing for graph reduction, and uses PUB in the BnB search process for branch pruning. Extensive experiments with diverse s values demonstrate the significant progress of our algorithm over state-of-the-art BnB MBP algorithms. Moreover, our initial lower bound can also be generalized to other relaxation clique problems.
