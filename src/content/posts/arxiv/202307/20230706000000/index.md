**ABSTRACT**  
We present SDXL, a latent diffusion model for text-to-image synthesis. Compared to previous versions of Stable Diffusion, SDXL leverages a three times larger UNet backbone: The increase of model parameters is mainly due to more attention blocks and a larger cross-attention context as SDXL uses a second text encoder. We design multiple novel conditioning schemes and train SDXL on multiple aspect ratios. We also introduce a refinement model which is used to improve the visual fidelity of samples generated by SDXL using a post-hoc image-to-image technique. We demonstrate that SDXL shows drastically improved performance compared the previous versions of Stable Diffusion and achieves results competitive with those of black-box state-of-the-art image generators. In the spirit of promoting open research and fostering transparency in large model training and evaluation, we provide access to code and model weights at https://github.com/Stability-AI/generative-models

**ABSTRACT**  
Existing datasets for manually labelled query-based video summarization are costly and thus small, limiting the performance of supervised deep video summarization models. Self-supervision can address the data sparsity challenge by using a pretext task and defining a method to acquire extra data with pseudo labels to pre-train a supervised deep model. In this work, we introduce segment-level pseudo labels from input videos to properly model both the relationship between a pretext task and a target task, and the implicit relationship between the pseudo label and the human-defined label. The pseudo labels are generated based on existing human-defined frame-level labels. To create more accurate query-dependent video summaries, a semantics booster is proposed to generate context-aware query representations. Furthermore, we propose mutual attention to help capture the interactive information between visual and textual modalities. Three commonly-used video summarization benchmarks are used to thoroughly validate the proposed approach. Experimental results show that the proposed video summarization algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recent works in object detection in LiDAR point clouds mostly focus on predicting bounding boxes around objects. This prediction is commonly achieved using anchor-based or anchor-free detectors that predict bounding boxes, requiring significant explicit prior knowledge about the objects to work properly. To remedy these limitations, we propose MaskBEV, a bird's-eye view (BEV) mask-based object detector neural architecture. MaskBEV predicts a set of BEV instance masks that represent the footprints of detected objects. Moreover, our approach allows object detection and footprint completion in a single pass. MaskBEV also reformulates the detection problem purely in terms of classification, doing away with regression usually done to predict bounding boxes. We evaluate the performance of MaskBEV on both SemanticKITTI and KITTI datasets while analyzing the architecture advantages and limitations.

**ABSTRACT**  
Equipping embodied agents with commonsense is important for robots to successfully complete complex human instructions in general environments. Recent large language models (LLM) can embed rich semantic knowledge for agents in plan generation of complex tasks, while they lack the information about the realistic world and usually yield infeasible action sequences. In this paper, we propose a TAsk Planing Agent (TaPA) in embodied tasks for grounded planning with physical scene constraint, where the agent generates executable plans according to the existed objects in the scene by aligning LLMs with the visual perception models. Specifically, we first construct a multimodal dataset containing triplets of indoor scenes, instructions and action plans, where we provide the designed prompts and the list of existing objects in the scene for GPT-3.5 to generate a large number of instructions and corresponding planned actions. The generated data is leveraged for grounded plan tuning of pre-trained LLMs. During inference, we discover the objects in the scene by extending open-vocabulary object detectors to multi-view RGB images collected in different achievable locations. Experimental results show that the generated plan from our TaPA framework can achieve higher success rate than LLaVA and GPT-3.5 by a sizable margin, which indicates the practicality of embodied task planning in general and complex environments.

**ABSTRACT**  
The rapid evolution of high-end smartphones with advanced high-resolution cameras has resulted in contactless capture of fingerprint biometrics that are more reliable and suitable for verification. Similar to other biometric systems, contactless fingerprint-verification systems are vulnerable to presentation attacks. In this paper, we present a comparative study on the generalizability of seven different pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and a Vision Transformer (ViT) to reliably detect presentation attacks. Extensive experiments were carried out on publicly available smartphone-based presentation attack datasets using four different Presentation Attack Instruments (PAI). The detection performance of the eighth deep feature technique was evaluated using the leave-one-out protocol to benchmark the generalization performance for unseen PAI. The obtained results indicated the best generalization performance with the ResNet50 CNN.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this paper, we present EdgeFace, a lightweight and efficient face recognition network inspired by the hybrid architecture of EdgeNeXt. By effectively combining the strengths of both CNN and Transformer models, and a low rank linear layer, EdgeFace achieves excellent face recognition performance optimized for edge devices. The proposed EdgeFace network not only maintains low computational costs and compact storage, but also achieves high face recognition accuracy, making it suitable for deployment on edge devices. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmark face datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of EdgeFace in comparison to state-of-the-art lightweight models and deep face recognition models. Our EdgeFace model with 1.77M parameters achieves state of the art results on LFW (99.73%), IJB-B (92.67%), and IJB-C (94.85%), outperforming other efficient models with larger computational complexities. The code to replicate the experiments will be made available publicly.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recent Diffusion Transformers (e.g., DiT) have demonstrated their powerful effectiveness in generating high-quality 2D images. However, it is still being determined whether the Transformer architecture performs equally well in 3D shape generation, as previous 3D diffusion methods mostly adopted the U-Net architecture. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel Diffusion Transformer for 3D shape generation, namely DiT-3D, which can directly operate the denoising process on voxelized point clouds using plain Transformers. Compared to existing U-Net approaches, our DiT-3D is more scalable in model size and produces much higher quality generations. Specifically, the DiT-3D adopts the design philosophy of DiT but modifies it by incorporating 3D positional and patch embeddings to adaptively aggregate input from voxelized point clouds. To reduce the computational cost of self-attention in 3D shape generation, we incorporate 3D window attention into Transformer blocks, as the increased 3D token length resulting from the additional dimension of voxels can lead to high computation. Finally, linear and devoxelization layers are used to predict the denoised point clouds. In addition, our transformer architecture supports efficient fine-tuning from 2D to 3D, where the pre-trained DiT-2D checkpoint on ImageNet can significantly improve DiT-3D on ShapeNet. Experimental results on the ShapeNet dataset demonstrate that the proposed DiT-3D achieves state-of-the-art performance in high-fidelity and diverse 3D point cloud generation. In particular, our DiT-3D decreases the 1-Nearest Neighbor Accuracy of the state-of-the-art method by 4.59 and increases the Coverage metric by 3.51 when evaluated on Chamfer Distance.

**ABSTRACT**  
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a prevalent psychiatric condition characterized by atypical cognitive, emotional, and social patterns. Timely and accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective interventions and improved outcomes in individuals with ASD. In this study, we propose a novel Multi-Atlas Enhanced Transformer framework, METAFormer, ASD classification. Our framework utilizes resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data from the ABIDE I dataset, comprising 406 ASD and 476 typical control (TC) subjects. METAFormer employs a multi-atlas approach, where flattened connectivity matrices from the AAL, CC200, and DOS160 atlases serve as input to the transformer encoder. Notably, we demonstrate that self-supervised pretraining, involving the reconstruction of masked values from the input, significantly enhances classification performance without the need for additional or separate training data. Through stratified cross-validation, we evaluate the proposed framework and show that it surpasses state-of-the-art performance on the ABIDE I dataset, with an average accuracy of 83.7% and an AUC-score of 0.832. The code for our framework is available at https://github.com/Lugges991/METAFormer

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper provides a novel framework for single-domain generalized object detection (i.e., Single-DGOD), where we are interested in learning and maintaining the semantic structures of self-augmented compound cross-domain samples to enhance the model's generalization ability. Different from DGOD trained on multiple source domains, Single-DGOD is far more challenging to generalize well to multiple target domains with only one single source domain. Existing methods mostly adopt a similar treatment from DGOD to learn domain-invariant features by decoupling or compressing the semantic space. However, there may have two potential limitations: 1) pseudo attribute-label correlation, due to extremely scarce single-domain data; and 2) the semantic structural information is usually ignored, i.e., we found the affinities of instance-level semantic relations in samples are crucial to model generalization. In this paper, we introduce Semantic Reasoning with Compound Domains (SRCD) for Single-DGOD. Specifically, our SRCD contains two main components, namely, the texture-based self-augmentation (TBSA) module, and the local-global semantic reasoning (LGSR) module. TBSA aims to eliminate the effects of irrelevant attributes associated with labels, such as light, shadow, color, etc., at the image level by a light-yet-efficient self-augmentation. Moreover, LGSR is used to further model the semantic relationships on instance features to uncover and maintain the intrinsic semantic structures. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SRCD.

**ABSTRACT**  
Stroke lesion volume is a key radiologic measurement for assessing the prognosis of Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS) patients, which is challenging to be automatically measured on Non-Contrast CT (NCCT) scans. Recent diffusion probabilistic models have shown potentials of being used for image segmentation. In this paper, a novel Synchronous image-label Diffusion Probability Model (SDPM) is proposed for stroke lesion segmentation on NCCT using Markov diffusion process. The proposed SDPM is fully based on a Latent Variable Model (LVM), offering a complete probabilistic elaboration. An additional net-stream, parallel with a noise prediction stream, is introduced to obtain initial noisy label estimates for efficiently inferring the final labels. By optimizing the specified variational boundaries, the trained model can infer multiple label estimates for reference given the input images with noises. The proposed model was assessed on three stroke lesion datasets including one public and two private datasets. Compared to several U-net and transformer-based segmentation methods, our proposed SDPM model is able to achieve state-of-the-art performance. The code is publicly available.

**ABSTRACT**  
With the perpetual increase of complexity of the state-of-the-art deep neural networks, it becomes a more and more challenging task to maintain their interpretability. Our work aims to evaluate the effects of adversarial training utilized to produce robust models - less vulnerable to adversarial attacks. It has been shown to make computer vision models more interpretable. Interpretability is as essential as robustness when we deploy the models to the real world. To prove the correlation between these two problems, we extensively examine the models using local feature-importance methods (SHAP, Integrated Gradients) and feature visualization techniques (Representation Inversion, Class Specific Image Generation). Standard models, compared to robust are more susceptible to adversarial attacks, and their learned representations are less meaningful to humans. Conversely, these models focus on distinctive regions of the images which support their predictions. Moreover, the features learned by the robust model are closer to the real ones.

**ABSTRACT**  
Many skin lesion analysis (SLA) methods recently focused on developing a multi-modal-based multi-label classification method due to two factors. The first is multi-modal data, i.e., clinical and dermoscopy images, which can provide complementary information to obtain more accurate results than single-modal data. The second one is that multi-label classification, i.e., seven-point checklist (SPC) criteria as an auxiliary classification task can not only boost the diagnostic accuracy of melanoma in the deep learning (DL) pipeline but also provide more useful functions to the clinical doctor as it is commonly used in clinical dermatologist's diagnosis. However, most methods only focus on designing a better module for multi-modal data fusion; few methods explore utilizing the label correlation between SPC and skin disease for performance improvement. This study fills the gap that introduces a Graph Convolution Network (GCN) to exploit prior co-occurrence between each category as a correlation matrix into the DL model for the multi-label classification. However, directly applying GCN degraded the performances in our experiments; we attribute this to the weak generalization ability of GCN in the scenario of insufficient statistical samples of medical data. We tackle this issue by proposing a Graph-Ensemble Learning Model (GELN) that views the prediction from GCN as complementary information of the predictions from the fusion model and adaptively fuses them by a weighted averaging scheme, which can utilize the valuable information from GCN while avoiding its negative influences as much as possible. To evaluate our method, we conduct experiments on public datasets. The results illustrate that our GELN can consistently improve the classification performance on different datasets and that the proposed method can achieve state-of-the-art performance in SPC and diagnosis classification.

**ABSTRACT**  
The application of mobile biometrics as a user-friendly authentication method has increased in the last years. Recent studies have proposed novel behavioral biometric recognition systems based on Transformers, which currently outperform the state of the art in several application scenarios. On-line handwritten signature verification aims to verify the identity of subjects, based on their biometric signatures acquired using electronic devices such as tablets or smartphones. This paper investigates the suitability of architectures based on recent Transformers for on-line signature verification. In particular, four different configurations are studied, two of them rely on the Vanilla Transformer encoder, and the two others have been successfully applied to the tasks of gait and activity recognition. We evaluate the four proposed configurations according to the experimental protocol proposed in the SVC-onGoing competition. The results obtained in our experiments are promising, and promote the use of Transformers for on-line signature verification.

**ABSTRACT**  
Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising approach for remote sensing image classification due to its ability to leverage large amounts of unlabeled data. In contrast to traditional supervised learning, SSL aims to learn representations of data without the need for explicit labels. This is achieved by formulating auxiliary tasks that can be used to create pseudo-labels for the unlabeled data and learn pre-trained models. The pre-trained models can then be fine-tuned on downstream tasks such as remote sensing image scene classification. The paper analyzes the effectiveness of SSL pre-training using Million AID - a large unlabeled remote sensing dataset on various remote sensing image scene classification datasets as downstream tasks. More specifically, we evaluate the effectiveness of SSL pre-training using the iBOT framework coupled with Vision transformers (ViT) in contrast to supervised pre-training of ViT using the ImageNet dataset. The comprehensive experimental work across 14 datasets with diverse properties reveals that in-domain SSL leads to improved predictive performance of models compared to the supervised counterparts.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper aims to address the unsupervised video anomaly detection (VAD) problem, which involves classifying each frame in a video as normal or abnormal, without any access to labels. To accomplish this, the proposed method employs conditional diffusion models, where the input data is the spatiotemporal features extracted from a pre-trained network, and the condition is the features extracted from compact motion representations that summarize a given video segment in terms of its motion and appearance. Our method utilizes a data-driven threshold and considers a high reconstruction error as an indicator of anomalous events. This study is the first to utilize compact motion representations for VAD and the experiments conducted on two large-scale VAD benchmarks demonstrate that they supply relevant information to the diffusion model, and consequently improve VAD performances w.r.t the prior art. Importantly, our method exhibits better generalization performance across different datasets, notably outperforming both the state-of-the-art and baseline methods. The code of our method is available at https://github.com/AnilOsmanTur/conditioned_video_anomaly_diffusion

**ABSTRACT**  
Harvesting fully ripe tomatoes with mobile robots presents significant challenges in real-world scenarios. These challenges arise from factors such as occlusion caused by leaves and branches, as well as the color similarity between tomatoes and the surrounding foliage during the fruit development stage. The natural environment further compounds these issues with varying light conditions, viewing angles, occlusion factors, and different maturity levels. To overcome these obstacles, this research introduces a novel framework that leverages a convolutional transformer architecture to autonomously recognize and grade tomatoes, irrespective of their occlusion level, lighting conditions, and ripeness. The proposed model is trained and tested using carefully annotated images curated specifically for this purpose. The dataset is prepared under various lighting conditions, viewing perspectives, and employs different mobile camera sensors, distinguishing it from existing datasets such as Laboro Tomato and Rob2Pheno Annotated Tomato. The effectiveness of the proposed framework in handling cluttered and occluded tomato instances was evaluated using two additional public datasets, Laboro Tomato and Rob2Pheno Annotated Tomato, as benchmarks. The evaluation results across these three datasets demonstrate the exceptional performance of our proposed framework, surpassing the state-of-the-art by 58.14%, 65.42%, and 66.39% in terms of mean average precision scores for KUTomaData, Laboro Tomato, and Rob2Pheno Annotated Tomato, respectively. The results underscore the superiority of the proposed model in accurately detecting and delineating tomatoes compared to baseline methods and previous approaches. Specifically, the model achieves an F1-score of 80.14%, a Dice coefficient of 73.26%, and a mean IoU of 66.41% on the KUTomaData image dataset.

**ABSTRACT**  
Autonomous vehicles and Advanced Driving Assistance Systems (ADAS) have the potential to radically change the way we travel. Many such vehicles currently rely on segmentation and object detection algorithms to detect and track objects around its surrounding. The data collected from the vehicles are often sent to cloud servers to facilitate continual/life-long learning of these algorithms. Considering the bandwidth constraints, the data is compressed before sending it to servers, where it is typically decompressed for training and analysis. In this work, we propose the use of a learning-based compression Codec to reduce the overhead in latency incurred for the decompression operation in the standard pipeline. We demonstrate that the learned compressed representation can also be used to perform tasks like semantic segmentation in addition to decompression to obtain the images. We experimentally validate the proposed pipeline on the Cityscapes dataset, where we achieve a compression factor up to $66 \times$ while preserving the information required to perform segmentation with a dice coefficient of $0.84$ as compared to $0.88$ achieved using decompressed images while reducing the overall compute by $11\%$.

**ABSTRACT**  
Abdominal wall defects often lead to pain, discomfort, and recurrence of incisional hernias, resulting in significant morbidity and repeated surgical repairs worldwide. Mesh repair for large hernias is usually based on the defect area with a fixed overlap, without considering biomechanical aspects such as muscle activation, intra-abdominal pressure, tissue elasticity, and abdominal wall distention. To address this issue, we present a biomechanical approach to incisional hernia repair that takes into account the unstable abdominal wall. Additionally, we introduce HEDI, a tool that uses dynamic computed tomography with Valsalva maneuver to automatically detect and assess hernia size, volume, and abdominal wall instability. Our first clinical application of HEDI in the preoperative evaluation of 31 patients shows significantly improved success rates compared to reported rates, with all patients remaining pain-free and showing no hernia recurrence after three years of follow-up.

**ABSTRACT**  
LiDAR scanning for surveying applications acquire measurements over wide areas and long distances, which produces large-scale 3D point clouds with significant local density variations. While existing 3D semantic segmentation models conduct downsampling and upsampling to build robustness against varying point densities, they are less effective under the large local density variations characteristic of point clouds from surveying applications. To alleviate this weakness, we propose a novel architecture called HDVNet that contains a nested set of encoder-decoder pathways, each handling a specific point density range. Limiting the interconnections between the feature maps enables HDVNet to gauge the reliability of each feature based on the density of a point, e.g., downweighting high density features not existing in low density objects. By effectively handling input density variations, HDVNet outperforms state-of-the-art models in segmentation accuracy on real point clouds with inconsistent density, using just over half the weights.

**ABSTRACT**  
Deep learning models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in learning complex patterns and concepts from training data. However, recent findings indicate that these models tend to rely heavily on simple and easily discernible features present in the background of images rather than the main concepts or objects they are intended to classify. This phenomenon poses a challenge to image classifiers as the crucial elements of interest in images may be overshadowed. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to address this issue and improve the learning of main concepts by image classifiers. Our central idea revolves around concurrently guiding the model's attention toward the foreground during the classification task. By emphasizing the foreground, which encapsulates the primary objects of interest, we aim to shift the focus of the model away from the dominant influence of the background. To accomplish this, we introduce a mechanism that encourages the model to allocate sufficient attention to the foreground. We investigate various strategies, including modifying the loss function or incorporating additional architectural components, to enable the classifier to effectively capture the primary concept within an image. Additionally, we explore the impact of different foreground attention mechanisms on model performance and provide insights into their effectiveness. Through extensive experimentation on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed approach in improving the classification accuracy of image classifiers. Our findings highlight the importance of foreground attention in enhancing model understanding and representation of the main concepts within images. The results of this study contribute to advancing the field of image classification and provide valuable insights for developing more robust and accurate deep-learning models.

**ABSTRACT**  
Few-shot image generation (FSIG) aims to learn to generate new and diverse images given few (e.g., 10) training samples. Recent work has addressed FSIG by leveraging a GAN pre-trained on a large-scale source domain and adapting it to the target domain with few target samples. Central to recent FSIG methods are knowledge preservation criteria, which select and preserve a subset of source knowledge to the adapted model. However, a major limitation of existing methods is that their knowledge preserving criteria consider only source domain/task and fail to consider target domain/adaptation in selecting source knowledge, casting doubt on their suitability for setups of different proximity between source and target domain. Our work makes two contributions. Firstly, we revisit recent FSIG works and their experiments. We reveal that under setups which assumption of close proximity between source and target domains is relaxed, many existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods which consider only source domain in knowledge preserving perform no better than a baseline method. As our second contribution, we propose Adaptation-Aware kernel Modulation (AdAM) for general FSIG of different source-target domain proximity. Extensive experiments show that AdAM consistently achieves SOTA performance in FSIG, including challenging setups where source and target domains are more apart.

**ABSTRACT**  
Accurately matching local features between a pair of images is a challenging computer vision task. Previous studies typically use attention based graph neural networks (GNNs) with fully-connected graphs over keypoints within/across images for visual and geometric information reasoning. However, in the context of feature matching, considerable keypoints are non-repeatable due to occlusion and failure of the detector, and thus irrelevant for message passing. The connectivity with non-repeatable keypoints not only introduces redundancy, resulting in limited efficiency, but also interferes with the representation aggregation process, leading to limited accuracy. Targeting towards high accuracy and efficiency, we propose MaKeGNN, a sparse attention-based GNN architecture which bypasses non-repeatable keypoints and leverages matchable ones to guide compact and meaningful message passing. More specifically, our Bilateral Context-Aware Sampling Module first dynamically samples two small sets of well-distributed keypoints with high matchability scores from the image pair. Then, our Matchable Keypoint-Assisted Context Aggregation Module regards sampled informative keypoints as message bottlenecks and thus constrains each keypoint only to retrieve favorable contextual information from intra- and inter- matchable keypoints, evading the interference of irrelevant and redundant connectivity with non-repeatable ones. Furthermore, considering the potential noise in initial keypoints and sampled matchable ones, the MKACA module adopts a matchability-guided attentional aggregation operation for purer data-dependent context propagation. By these means, we achieve the state-of-the-art performance on relative camera estimation, fundamental matrix estimation, and visual localization, while significantly reducing computational and memory complexity compared to typical attentional GNNs.

**ABSTRACT**  
Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become increasingly popular for classification tasks on graph-structured data. Yet, the interplay between graph topology and feature evolution in GNNs is not well understood. In this paper, we focus on node-wise classification, illustrated with community detection on stochastic block model graphs, and explore the feature evolution through the lens of the "Neural Collapse" (NC) phenomenon. When training instance-wise deep classifiers (e.g. for image classification) beyond the zero training error point, NC demonstrates a reduction in the deepest features' within-class variability and an increased alignment of their class means to certain symmetric structures. We start with an empirical study that shows that a decrease in within-class variability is also prevalent in the node-wise classification setting, however, not to the extent observed in the instance-wise case. Then, we theoretically study this distinction. Specifically, we show that even an "optimistic" mathematical model requires that the graphs obey a strict structural condition in order to possess a minimizer with exact collapse. Interestingly, this condition is viable also for heterophilic graphs and relates to recent empirical studies on settings with improved GNNs' generalization. Furthermore, by studying the gradient dynamics of the theoretical model, we provide reasoning for the partial collapse observed empirically. Finally, we present a study on the evolution of within- and between-class feature variability across layers of a well-trained GNN and contrast the behavior with spectral methods.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recent advances in text-to-image generative models provide the ability to generate high-quality images from short text descriptions. These foundation models, when pre-trained on billion-scale datasets, are effective for various downstream tasks with little or no further training. A natural question to ask is how such models may be adapted for image compression. We investigate several techniques in which the pre-trained models can be directly used to implement compression schemes targeting novel low rate regimes. We show how text descriptions can be used in conjunction with side information to generate high-fidelity reconstructions that preserve both semantics and spatial structure of the original. We demonstrate that at very low bit-rates, our method can significantly improve upon learned compressors in terms of perceptual and semantic fidelity, despite no end-to-end training.

**ABSTRACT**  
Modeling weather and climate is an essential endeavor to understand the near- and long-term impacts of climate change, as well as inform technology and policymaking for adaptation and mitigation efforts. In recent years, there has been a surging interest in applying data-driven methods based on machine learning for solving core problems such as weather forecasting and climate downscaling. Despite promising results, much of this progress has been impaired due to the lack of large-scale, open-source efforts for reproducibility, resulting in the use of inconsistent or underspecified datasets, training setups, and evaluations by both domain scientists and artificial intelligence researchers. We introduce ClimateLearn, an open-source PyTorch library that vastly simplifies the training and evaluation of machine learning models for data-driven climate science. ClimateLearn consists of holistic pipelines for dataset processing (e.g., ERA5, CMIP6, PRISM), implementation of state-of-the-art deep learning models (e.g., Transformers, ResNets), and quantitative and qualitative evaluation for standard weather and climate modeling tasks. We supplement these functionalities with extensive documentation, contribution guides, and quickstart tutorials to expand access and promote community growth. We have also performed comprehensive forecasting and downscaling experiments to showcase the capabilities and key features of our library. To our knowledge, ClimateLearn is the first large-scale, open-source effort for bridging research in weather and climate modeling with modern machine learning systems. Our library is available publicly at https://github.com/aditya-grover/climate-learn.

**ABSTRACT**  
Seismic advances in generative AI algorithms for imagery, text, and other data types has led to the temptation to use synthetic data to train next-generation models. Repeating this process creates an autophagous (self-consuming) loop whose properties are poorly understood. We conduct a thorough analytical and empirical analysis using state-of-the-art generative image models of three families of autophagous loops that differ in how fixed or fresh real training data is available through the generations of training and in whether the samples from previous generation models have been biased to trade off data quality versus diversity. Our primary conclusion across all scenarios is that without enough fresh real data in each generation of an autophagous loop, future generative models are doomed to have their quality (precision) or diversity (recall) progressively decrease. We term this condition Model Autophagy Disorder (MAD), making analogy to mad cow disease.

**ABSTRACT**  
We consider the problem of learning models for risk-sensitive reinforcement learning. We theoretically demonstrate that proper value equivalence, a method of learning models which can be used to plan optimally in the risk-neutral setting, is not sufficient to plan optimally in the risk-sensitive setting. We leverage distributional reinforcement learning to introduce two new notions of model equivalence, one which is general and can be used to plan for any risk measure, but is intractable; and a practical variation which allows one to choose which risk measures they may plan optimally for. We demonstrate how our framework can be used to augment any model-free risk-sensitive algorithm, and provide both tabular and large-scale experiments to demonstrate its ability.

**ABSTRACT**  
Diffusion models based on permutation-equivariant networks can learn permutation-invariant distributions for graph data. However, in comparison to their non-invariant counterparts, we have found that these invariant models encounter greater learning challenges since 1) their effective target distributions exhibit more modes; 2) their optimal one-step denoising scores are the score functions of Gaussian mixtures with more components. Motivated by this analysis, we propose a non-invariant diffusion model, called $\textit{SwinGNN}$, which employs an efficient edge-to-edge 2-WL message passing network and utilizes shifted window based self-attention inspired by SwinTransformers. Further, through systematic ablations, we identify several critical training and sampling techniques that significantly improve the sample quality of graph generation. At last, we introduce a simple post-processing trick, $\textit{i.e.}$, randomly permuting the generated graphs, which provably converts any graph generative model to a permutation-invariant one. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world protein and molecule datasets show that our SwinGNN achieves state-of-the-art performances. Our code is released at https://github.com/qiyan98/SwinGNN.

**ABSTRACT**  
Heterogeneous graph neural networks (GNNs) have been successful in handling heterogeneous graphs. In existing heterogeneous GNNs, meta-path plays an essential role. However, recent work pointed out that simple homogeneous graph model without meta-path can also achieve comparable results, which calls into question the necessity of meta-path. In this paper, we first present the intrinsic difference about meta-path-based and meta-path-free models, i.e., how to select neighbors for node aggregation. Then, we propose a novel framework to utilize the rich type semantic information in heterogeneous graphs comprehensively, namely HAGNN (Hybrid Aggregation for Heterogeneous GNNs). The core of HAGNN is to leverage the meta-path neighbors and the directly connected neighbors simultaneously for node aggregations. HAGNN divides the overall aggregation process into two phases: meta-path-based intra-type aggregation and meta-path-free inter-type aggregation. During the intra-type aggregation phase, we propose a new data structure called fused meta-path graph and perform structural semantic aware aggregation on it. Finally, we combine the embeddings generated by each phase. Compared with existing heterogeneous GNN models, HAGNN can take full advantage of the heterogeneity in heterogeneous graphs. Extensive experimental results on node classification, node clustering, and link prediction tasks show that HAGNN outperforms the existing modes, demonstrating the effectiveness of HAGNN.

**ABSTRACT**  
Multivariate time series forecasting plays a critical role in diverse domains. While recent advancements in deep learning methods, especially Transformers, have shown promise, there remains a gap in addressing the significance of inter-series dependencies. This paper introduces SageFormer, a Series-aware Graph-enhanced Transformer model designed to effectively capture and model dependencies between series using graph structures. SageFormer tackles two key challenges: effectively representing diverse temporal patterns across series and mitigating redundant information among series. Importantly, the proposed series-aware framework seamlessly integrates with existing Transformer-based models, augmenting their ability to model inter-series dependencies. Through extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets, we showcase the superior performance of SageFormer compared to previous state-of-the-art approaches.

**ABSTRACT**  
Detecting abnormal patterns that deviate from a certain regular repeating pattern in time series is essential in many big data applications. However, the lack of labels, the dynamic nature of time series data, and unforeseeable abnormal behaviors make the detection process challenging. Despite the success of recent deep anomaly detection approaches, the mystical mechanisms in such black-box models have become a new challenge in safety-critical applications. The lack of model transparency and prediction reliability hinders further breakthroughs in such domains. This paper proposes ProtoAD, using prototypes as the example-based explanation for the state of regular patterns during anomaly detection. Without significant impact on the detection performance, prototypes shed light on the deep black-box models and provide intuitive understanding for domain experts and stakeholders. We extend the widely used prototype learning in classification problems into anomaly detection. By visualizing both the latent space and input space prototypes, we intuitively demonstrate how regular data are modeled and why specific patterns are considered abnormal.

**ABSTRACT**  
Peak-Hour Series Forecasting (PHSF) is a crucial yet underexplored task in various domains. While state-of-the-art deep learning models excel in regular Time Series Forecasting (TSF), they struggle to achieve comparable results in PHSF. This can be attributed to the challenges posed by the high degree of non-stationarity in peak-hour series, which makes direct forecasting more difficult than standard TSF. Additionally, manually extracting the maximum value from regular forecasting results leads to suboptimal performance due to models minimizing the mean deficit. To address these issues, this paper presents Seq2Peak, a novel framework designed specifically for PHSF tasks, bridging the performance gap observed in TSF models. Seq2Peak offers two key components: the CyclicNorm pipeline to mitigate the non-stationarity issue, and a simple yet effective trainable-parameter-free peak-hour decoder with a hybrid loss function that utilizes both the original series and peak-hour series as supervised signals. Extensive experimentation on publicly available time series datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed framework, yielding a remarkable average relative improvement of 37.7\% across four real-world datasets for both transformer- and non-transformer-based TSF models.

**ABSTRACT**  
Tailoring treatment for individual patients is crucial yet challenging in order to achieve optimal healthcare outcomes. Recent advances in reinforcement learning offer promising personalized treatment recommendations; however, they rely solely on current patient observations (vital signs, demographics) as the patient's state, which may not accurately represent the true health status of the patient. This limitation hampers policy learning and evaluation, ultimately limiting treatment effectiveness. In this study, we propose the Deep Attention Q-Network for personalized treatment recommendations, utilizing the Transformer architecture within a deep reinforcement learning framework to efficiently incorporate all past patient observations. We evaluated the model on real-world sepsis and acute hypotension cohorts, demonstrating its superiority to state-of-the-art models. The source code for our model is available at https://github.com/stevenmsm/RL-ICU-DAQN.

**ABSTRACT**  
Self-supervised learning in federated learning paradigm has been gaining a lot of interest both in industry and research due to the collaborative learning capability on unlabeled yet isolated data. However, self-supervised based federated learning strategies suffer from performance degradation due to label scarcity and diverse data distributions, i.e., data heterogeneity. In this paper, we propose the SelfFed framework for Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). Our proposed SelfFed framework works in two phases. The first phase is the pre-training paradigm that performs augmentive modeling using Swin Transformer based encoder in a decentralized manner. The first phase of SelfFed framework helps to overcome the data heterogeneity issue. The second phase is the fine-tuning paradigm that introduces contrastive network and a novel aggregation strategy that is trained on limited labeled data for a target task in a decentralized manner. This fine-tuning stage overcomes the label scarcity problem. We perform our experimental analysis on publicly available medical imaging datasets and show that our proposed SelfFed framework performs better when compared to existing baselines concerning non-independent and identically distributed (IID) data and label scarcity. Our method achieves a maximum improvement of 8.8% and 4.1% on Retina and COVID-FL datasets on non-IID dataset. Further, our proposed method outperforms existing baselines even when trained on a few (10%) labeled instances.

**ABSTRACT**  
Differentiating malware is important to determine their behaviors and level of threat; as well as to devise defensive strategy against them. In response, various anti-malware systems have been developed to distinguish between different malwares. However, most of the recent malware families are Artificial Intelligence (AI) enable and can deceive traditional anti-malware systems using different obfuscation techniques. Therefore, only AI-enabled anti-malware system is robust against these techniques and can detect different features in the malware files that aid in malicious activities. In this study we review two AI-enabled techniques for detecting malware in Windows and Android operating system, respectively. Both the techniques achieved perfect accuracy in detecting various malware families.

**ABSTRACT**  
Modeling and forecasting multivariate time series not only facilitates the decision making of practitioners, but also deepens our scientific understanding of the underlying dynamical systems. Spatial-temporal graph neural networks (STGNNs) are emerged as powerful predictors and have become the de facto models for learning spatiotemporal representations in recent years. However, existing architectures of STGNNs tend to be complicated by stacking a series of fancy layers. The designed models could be either redundant or enigmatic, which pose great challenges on their complexity and scalability. Such concerns prompt us to re-examine the designs of modern STGNNs and identify core principles that contribute to a powerful and efficient neural predictor. Here we present a compact predictive model that is fully defined by a dense encoder-decoder and a message-passing layer, powered by node identifications, without any complex sequential modules, e.g., TCNs, RNNs, and Transformers. Empirical results demonstrate how a simple and elegant model with proper inductive basis can compare favorably w.r.t. the state of the art with elaborate designs, while being much more interpretable and computationally efficient for spatial-temporal forecasting problem. We hope our findings would open new horizons for future studies to revisit the design of more concise neural forecasting architectures.

**ABSTRACT**  
Reinforcement learning is an essential paradigm for solving sequential decision problems under uncertainty. Despite many remarkable achievements in recent decades, applying reinforcement learning methods in the real world remains challenging. One of the main obstacles is that reinforcement learning agents lack a fundamental understanding of the world and must therefore learn from scratch through numerous trial-and-error interactions. They may also face challenges in providing explanations for their decisions and generalizing the acquired knowledge. Causality, however, offers a notable advantage as it can formalize knowledge in a systematic manner and leverage invariance for effective knowledge transfer. This has led to the emergence of causal reinforcement learning, a subfield of reinforcement learning that seeks to enhance existing algorithms by incorporating causal relationships into the learning process. In this survey, we comprehensively review the literature on causal reinforcement learning. We first introduce the basic concepts of causality and reinforcement learning, and then explain how causality can address core challenges in non-causal reinforcement learning. We categorize and systematically review existing causal reinforcement learning approaches based on their target problems and methodologies. Finally, we outline open issues and future directions in this emerging field.

**ABSTRACT**  
Knowledge graph embeddings (KGE) have been extensively studied to embed large-scale relational data for many real-world applications. Existing methods have long ignored the fact many KGs contain two fundamentally different views: high-level ontology-view concepts and fine-grained instance-view entities. They usually embed all nodes as vectors in one latent space. However, a single geometric representation fails to capture the structural differences between two views and lacks probabilistic semantics towards concepts' granularity. We propose Concept2Box, a novel approach that jointly embeds the two views of a KG using dual geometric representations. We model concepts with box embeddings, which learn the hierarchy structure and complex relations such as overlap and disjoint among them. Box volumes can be interpreted as concepts' granularity. Different from concepts, we model entities as vectors. To bridge the gap between concept box embeddings and entity vector embeddings, we propose a novel vector-to-box distance metric and learn both embeddings jointly. Experiments on both the public DBpedia KG and a newly-created industrial KG showed the effectiveness of Concept2Box.

**ABSTRACT**  
The balance of game content significantly impacts the gaming experience. Unbalanced game content diminishes engagement or increases frustration because of repetitive failure. Although game designers intend to adjust the difficulty of game content, this is a repetitive, labor-intensive, and challenging process, especially for commercial-level games with extensive content. To address this issue, the game research community has explored automated game balancing using artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. However, previous studies have focused on limited game content and did not consider the importance of the generalization ability of playtesting agents when encountering content changes. In this study, we propose RaidEnv, a new game simulator that includes diverse and customizable content for the boss raid scenario in MMORPG games. Additionally, we design two benchmarks for the boss raid scenario that can aid in the practical application of game AI. These benchmarks address two open problems in automatic content balancing, and we introduce two evaluation metrics to provide guidance for AI in automatic content balancing. This novel game research platform expands the frontiers of automatic game balancing problems and offers a framework within a realistic game production pipeline.

**ABSTRACT**  
The human brain possesses the extraordinary capability to contextualize the information it receives from our environment. The entorhinal-hippocampal plays a critical role in this function, as it is deeply engaged in memory processing and constructing cognitive maps using place and grid cells. Comprehending and leveraging this ability could significantly augment the field of artificial intelligence. The multi-scale successor representation serves as a good model for the functionality of place and grid cells and has already shown promise in this role. Here, we introduce a model that employs successor representations and neural networks, along with word embedding vectors, to construct a cognitive map of three separate concepts. The network adeptly learns two different scaled maps and situates new information in proximity to related pre-existing representations. The dispersion of information across the cognitive map varies according to its scale - either being heavily concentrated, resulting in the formation of the three concepts, or spread evenly throughout the map. We suggest that our model could potentially improve current AI models by providing multi-modal context information to any input, based on a similarity metric for the input and pre-existing knowledge representations.

**ABSTRACT**  
The use of knowledge graphs (KGs) enhances the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the responses provided by a conversational agent. While generating answers during conversations consists in generating text from these KGs, it is still regarded as a challenging task that has gained significant attention in recent years. In this document, we provide a review of different architectures used for knowledge graph-to-text generation including: Graph Neural Networks, the Graph Transformer, and linearization with seq2seq models. We discuss the advantages and limitations of each architecture and conclude that the choice of architecture will depend on the specific requirements of the task at hand. We also highlight the importance of considering constraints such as execution time and model validity, particularly in the context of conversational agents. Based on these constraints and the availability of labeled data for the domains of DAVI, we choose to use seq2seq Transformer-based models (PLMs) for the Knowledge Graph-to-Text Generation task. We aim to refine benchmark datasets of kg-to-text generation on PLMs and to explore the emotional and multilingual dimensions in our future work. Overall, this review provides insights into the different approaches for knowledge graph-to-text generation and outlines future directions for research in this area.

**ABSTRACT**  
We present a novel Diffusion Offline Multi-agent Model (DOM2) for offline Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). Different from existing algorithms that rely mainly on conservatism in policy design, DOM2 enhances policy expressiveness and diversity based on diffusion. Specifically, we incorporate a diffusion model into the policy network and propose a trajectory-based data-augmentation scheme in training. These key ingredients make our algorithm more robust to environment changes and achieve significant improvements in performance, generalization and data-efficiency. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that DOM2 outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in multi-agent particle and multi-agent MuJoCo environments, and generalizes significantly better in shifted environments thanks to its high expressiveness and diversity. Furthermore, DOM2 shows superior data efficiency and can achieve state-of-the-art performance with $20+$ times less data compared to existing algorithms.

**ABSTRACT**  
Mean decrease in impurity (MDI) is a popular feature importance measure for random forests (RFs). We show that the MDI for a feature $X_k$ in each tree in an RF is equivalent to the unnormalized $R^2$ value in a linear regression of the response on the collection of decision stumps that split on $X_k$. We use this interpretation to propose a flexible feature importance framework called MDI+. Specifically, MDI+ generalizes MDI by allowing the analyst to replace the linear regression model and $R^2$ metric with regularized generalized linear models (GLMs) and metrics better suited for the given data structure. Moreover, MDI+ incorporates additional features to mitigate known biases of decision trees against additive or smooth models. We further provide guidance on how practitioners can choose an appropriate GLM and metric based upon the Predictability, Computability, Stability framework for veridical data science. Extensive data-inspired simulations show that MDI+ significantly outperforms popular feature importance measures in identifying signal features. We also apply MDI+ to two real-world case studies on drug response prediction and breast cancer subtype classification. We show that MDI+ extracts well-established predictive genes with significantly greater stability compared to existing feature importance measures. All code and models are released in a full-fledged python package on Github.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper provides a comprehensive review of the literature concerning the utilization of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, with a particular focus on transformer-based large language models (LLMs) trained using Big Code, within the domain of AI-assisted programming tasks. LLMs, augmented with software naturalness, have played a crucial role in facilitating AI-assisted programming applications, including code generation, code completion, code translation, code refinement, code summarization, defect detection, and clone detection. Notable examples of such applications include the GitHub Copilot powered by OpenAI's Codex and DeepMind AlphaCode. This paper presents an overview of the major LLMs and their applications in downstream tasks related to AI-assisted programming. Furthermore, it explores the challenges and opportunities associated with incorporating NLP techniques with software naturalness in these applications, with a discussion on extending AI-assisted programming capabilities to Apple's Xcode for mobile software development. This paper also presents the challenges of and opportunities for incorporating NLP techniques with software naturalness, empowering developers with advanced coding assistance and streamlining the software development process.

**ABSTRACT**  
Large language models (LLMs) exhibit a wide range of promising capabilities -- from step-by-step planning to commonsense reasoning -- that may provide utility for robots, but remain prone to confidently hallucinated predictions. In this work, we present KnowNo, which is a framework for measuring and aligning the uncertainty of LLM-based planners such that they know when they don't know and ask for help when needed. KnowNo builds on the theory of conformal prediction to provide statistical guarantees on task completion while minimizing human help in complex multi-step planning settings. Experiments across a variety of simulated and real robot setups that involve tasks with different modes of ambiguity (e.g., from spatial to numeric uncertainties, from human preferences to Winograd schemas) show that KnowNo performs favorably over modern baselines (which may involve ensembles or extensive prompt tuning) in terms of improving efficiency and autonomy, while providing formal assurances. KnowNo can be used with LLMs out of the box without model-finetuning, and suggests a promising lightweight approach to modeling uncertainty that can complement and scale with the growing capabilities of foundation models.

**ABSTRACT**  
Quickly and reliably finding accurate inverse kinematics (IK) solutions remains a challenging problem for robotic manipulation. Existing numerical solvers typically produce a single solution only and rely on local search techniques to minimize a highly nonconvex objective function. Recently, learning-based approaches that approximate the entire feasible set of solutions have shown promise as a means to generate multiple fast and accurate IK results in parallel. However, existing learning-based techniques have a significant drawback: each robot of interest requires a specialized model that must be trained from scratch. To address this shortcoming, we investigate a novel distance-geometric robot representation coupled with a graph structure that allows us to leverage the flexibility of graph neural networks (GNNs). We use this approach to train a generative graphical inverse kinematics solver (GGIK) that is able to produce a large number of diverse solutions in parallel while also generalizing well -- a single learned model can be used to produce IK solutions for a variety of different robots. The graphical formulation elegantly exposes the symmetry and Euclidean equivariance of the IK problem that stems from the spatial nature of robot manipulators. We exploit this symmetry by encoding it into the architecture of our learned model, yielding a flexible solver that is able to produce sets of IK solutions for multiple robots.

**ABSTRACT**  
Palm-sized nano-drones are an appealing class of edge nodes, but their limited computational resources prevent running large deep-learning models onboard. Adopting an edge-fog computational paradigm, we can offload part of the computation to the fog; however, this poses security concerns if the fog node, or the communication link, can not be trusted. To tackle this concern, we propose a novel distributed edge-fog execution scheme that validates fog computation by redundantly executing a random subnetwork aboard our nano-drone. Compared to a State-of-the-Art visual pose estimation network that entirely runs onboard, a larger network executed in a distributed way improves the $R^2$ score by +0.19; in case of attack, our approach detects it within 2s with 95% probability.

**ABSTRACT**  
Occlusion is a major challenge for LiDAR-based object detection methods. This challenge becomes safety-critical in urban traffic where the ego vehicle must have reliable object detection to avoid collision while its field of view is severely reduced due to the obstruction posed by a large number of road users. Collaborative perception via Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication, which leverages the diverse perspective thanks to the presence at multiple locations of connected agents to form a complete scene representation, is an appealing solution. State-of-the-art V2X methods resolve the performance-bandwidth tradeoff using a mid-collaboration approach where the Bird-Eye View images of point clouds are exchanged so that the bandwidth consumption is lower than communicating point clouds as in early collaboration, and the detection performance is higher than late collaboration, which fuses agents' output, thanks to a deeper interaction among connected agents. While achieving strong performance, the real-world deployment of most mid-collaboration approaches is hindered by their overly complicated architectures, involving learnable collaboration graphs and autoencoder-based compressor/ decompressor, and unrealistic assumptions about inter-agent synchronization. In this work, we devise a simple yet effective collaboration method that achieves a better bandwidth-performance tradeoff than prior state-of-the-art methods while minimizing changes made to the single-vehicle detection models and relaxing unrealistic assumptions on inter-agent synchronization. Experiments on the V2X-Sim dataset show that our collaboration method achieves 98\% of the performance of an early-collaboration method, while only consuming the equivalent bandwidth of a late-collaboration method.

**ABSTRACT**  
The advancement in generative AI could be boosted with more accessible mathematics. Beyond human-AI chat, large language models (LLMs) are emerging in programming, algorithm discovery, and theorem proving, yet their genomics application is limited. This project introduces Math Agents and mathematical embedding as fresh entries to the "Moore's Law of Mathematics", using a GPT-based workflow to convert equations from literature into LaTeX and Python formats. While many digital equation representations exist, there's a lack of automated large-scale evaluation tools. LLMs are pivotal as linguistic user interfaces, providing natural language access for human-AI chat and formal languages for large-scale AI-assisted computational infrastructure. Given the infinite formal possibility spaces, Math Agents, which interact with math, could potentially shift us from "big data" to "big math". Math, unlike the more flexible natural language, has properties subject to proof, enabling its use beyond traditional applications like high-validation math-certified icons for AI alignment aims. This project aims to use Math Agents and mathematical embeddings to address the ageing issue in information systems biology by applying multiscalar physics mathematics to disease models and genomic data. Generative AI with episodic memory could help analyse causal relations in longitudinal health records, using SIR Precision Health models. Genomic data is suggested for addressing the unsolved Alzheimer's disease problem.

**ABSTRACT**  
We performed a billion locality sensitive hash comparisons between artificially generated data samples to answer the critical question - can we verify the "correctness" of generative AI output in a non-deterministic, trustless, decentralized network? We generate millions of data samples from a variety of open source diffusion and large language models and describe the procedures and trade-offs between generating more verses less deterministic output in a heterogenous, stochastic network. Further, we analyze the outputs to provide empirical evidence of different parameterizations of tolerance and error bounds for verification. Finally, given that we have the generated an enormous amount of simulated data, we also release a new training dataset called ImageNet-Gen for use in augmenting existing training pipelines. For our results, we show that with a majority vote between three independent verifiers, we can detect image generated perceptual collisions in generated AI with over 99.89% probability and less than 0.0267% chance of intra-class collision. For large language models (LLMs), we are able to gain 100% consensus using greedy methods or n-way beam searches to generate consensus demonstrated on different LLMs. In the context of generative AI training, we pinpoint and minimize the major sources of stochasticity and present gossip and synchronization training techniques for verifiability. Thus, this work provides a practical, solid foundation for AI verification and consensus for the minimization of trust in a decentralized network.

**ABSTRACT**  
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained growing interest in miscellaneous applications owing to their outstanding ability in extracting latent representation on graph structures. To render GNN-based service for IoT-driven smart applications, traditional model serving paradigms usually resort to the cloud by fully uploading geo-distributed input data to remote datacenters. However, our empirical measurements reveal the significant communication overhead of such cloud-based serving and highlight the profound potential in applying the emerging fog computing. To maximize the architectural benefits brought by fog computing, in this paper, we present Fograph, a novel distributed real-time GNN inference framework that leverages diverse and dynamic resources of multiple fog nodes in proximity to IoT data sources. By introducing heterogeneity-aware execution planning and GNN-specific compression techniques, Fograph tailors its design to well accommodate the unique characteristics of GNN serving in fog environments. Prototype-based evaluation and case study demonstrate that Fograph significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art cloud serving and fog deployment by up to 5.39x execution speedup and 6.84x throughput improvement.

**ABSTRACT**  
Web3Recommend is a decentralized Social Recommender System implementation that enables Web3 Platforms on Android to generate recommendations that balance trust and relevance. Generating recommendations in decentralized networks is a non-trivial problem because these networks lack a global perspective due to the absence of a central authority. Further, decentralized networks are prone to Sybil Attacks in which a single malicious user can generate multiple fake or Sybil identities. Web3Recommend relies on a novel graph-based content recommendation design inspired by GraphJet, a recommendation system used in Twitter enhanced with MeritRank, a decentralized reputation scheme that provides Sybil-resistance to the system. By adding MeritRank's decay parameters to the vanilla Social Recommender Systems' personalized SALSA graph algorithm, we can provide theoretical guarantees against Sybil Attacks in the generated recommendations. Similar to GraphJet, we focus on generating real-time recommendations by only acting on recent interactions in the social network, allowing us to cater temporally contextual recommendations while keeping a tight bound on the memory usage in resource-constrained devices, allowing for a seamless user experience. As a proof-of-concept, we integrate our system with MusicDAO, an open-source Web3 music-sharing platform, to generate personalized, real-time recommendations. Thus, we provide the first Sybil-resistant Social Recommender System, allowing real-time recommendations beyond classic user-based collaborative filtering. The system is also rigorously tested with extensive unit and integration tests. Further, our experiments demonstrate the trust-relevance balance of recommendations against multiple adversarial strategies in a test network generated using data from real music platforms.

Protoform reconstruction is the task of inferring what morphemes or words appeared like in the ancestral languages of a set of daughter languages. Meloni et al. (2021) achieved the state-of-the-art on Latin protoform reconstruction with an RNN-based encoder-decoder with attention model. We update their model with the state-of-the-art seq2seq model: the Transformer. Our model outperforms their model on a suite of different metrics on two different datasets: their Romance data of 8,000 cognates spanning 5 languages and a Chinese dataset (Hou 2004) of 800+ cognates spanning 39 varieties. We also probe our model for potential phylogenetic signal contained in the model. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/cmu-llab/acl-2023.

**ABSTRACT**  
In text classification tasks, fine tuning pretrained language models like BERT and GPT-3 yields competitive accuracy; however, both methods require pretraining on large text datasets. In contrast, general topic modeling methods possess the advantage of analyzing documents to extract meaningful patterns of words without the need of pretraining. To leverage topic modeling's unsupervised insights extraction on text classification tasks, we develop the Knowledge Distillation Semi-supervised Topic Modeling (KDSTM). KDSTM requires no pretrained embeddings, few labeled documents and is efficient to train, making it ideal under resource constrained settings. Across a variety of datasets, our method outperforms existing supervised topic modeling methods in classification accuracy, robustness and efficiency and achieves similar performance compare to state of the art weakly supervised text classification methods.

We provide a first exploration of these representations and how they can be used for understanding the inner sentimental workings of single sentences. We train predictors of the quantiles of the distributions of final sentiments of sentences from the hidden representations of an LLM applied to prefixes of increasing lengths. After showing that predictors of distributions of valence, determination, admiration, anxiety and annoyance are well calibrated, we provide examples of using these predictors for analyzing sentences, illustrating, for instance, how even ordinary conjunctions (e.g., "but") can dramatically alter the emotional trajectory of an utterance. We then show how to exploit the distributional predictions to generate sentences with sentiments in the tails of distributions. We discuss the implications of our results for the inner workings of thoughts, for instance for psychiatric dysfunction.

**ABSTRACT**  
Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) is a widely used criterion for training supervised sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models. It enables learning the relations between input and output sequences, termed alignments, by marginalizing over perfect alignments (that yield the ground truth), at the expense of imperfect alignments. This binary differentiation of perfect and imperfect alignments falls short of capturing other essential alignment properties that hold significance in other real-world applications. Here we propose $\textit{Align With Purpose}$, a $\textbf{general Plug-and-Play framework}$ for enhancing a desired property in models trained with the CTC criterion. We do that by complementing the CTC with an additional loss term that prioritizes alignments according to a desired property. Our method does not require any intervention in the CTC loss function, enables easy optimization of a variety of properties, and allows differentiation between both perfect and imperfect alignments. We apply our framework in the domain of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and show its generality in terms of property selection, architectural choice, and scale of training dataset (up to 280,000 hours). To demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, we apply it to two unrelated properties: emission time and word error rate (WER). For the former, we report an improvement of up to 570ms in latency optimization with a minor reduction in WER, and for the latter, we report a relative improvement of 4.5% WER over the baseline models. To the best of our knowledge, these applications have never been demonstrated to work on a scale of data as large as ours. Notably, our method can be implemented using only a few lines of code, and can be extended to other alignment-free loss functions and to domains other than ASR.

**ABSTRACT**  
Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) often requires both KG structural and textual information to be effective. Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have been used to learn the textual information, usually under the fine-tune paradigm for the KGC task. However, the fine-tuned PLMs often overwhelmingly focus on the textual information and overlook structural knowledge. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes CSProm-KG (Conditional Soft Prompts for KGC) which maintains a balance between structural information and textual knowledge. CSProm-KG only tunes the parameters of Conditional Soft Prompts that are generated by the entities and relations representations. We verify the effectiveness of CSProm-KG on three popular static KGC benchmarks WN18RR, FB15K-237 and Wikidata5M, and two temporal KGC benchmarks ICEWS14 and ICEWS05-15. CSProm-KG outperforms competitive baseline models and sets new state-of-the-art on these benchmarks. We conduct further analysis to show (i) the effectiveness of our proposed components, (ii) the efficiency of CSProm-KG, and (iii) the flexibility of CSProm-KG.

**ABSTRACT**  
Although there is widespread recognition of racial bias in US law, it is unclear how such bias appears in the language of law, namely judicial opinions, and whether it varies across time period or region. Building upon approaches for measuring implicit racial bias in large-scale corpora, we approximate GloVe word embeddings for over 6 million US federal and state court cases from 1860 to 2009. We find strong evidence of racial bias across nearly all regions and time periods, as traditionally Black names are more closely associated with pre-classified "unpleasant" terms whereas traditionally White names are more closely associated with pre-classified "pleasant" terms. We also test whether legal opinions before 1950 exhibit more implicit racial bias than those after 1950, as well as whether opinions from Southern states exhibit less change in racial bias than those from Northeastern states. We do not find evidence of elevated bias in legal opinions before 1950, or evidence that legal opinions from Northeastern states show greater change in racial bias over time compared to Southern states. These results motivate further research into institutionalized racial bias.

**ABSTRACT**  
The automatic detection of hate speech online is an active research area in NLP. Most of the studies to date are based on social media datasets that contribute to the creation of hate speech detection models trained on them. However, data creation processes contain their own biases, and models inherently learn from these dataset-specific biases. In this paper, we perform a large-scale cross-dataset comparison where we fine-tune language models on different hate speech detection datasets. This analysis shows how some datasets are more generalisable than others when used as training data. Crucially, our experiments show how combining hate speech detection datasets can contribute to the development of robust hate speech detection models. This robustness holds even when controlling by data size and compared with the best individual datasets.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this paper, we present several baselines for automatic speech recognition (ASR) models for the two official written languages in Norway: Bokm{\aa}l and Nynorsk. We compare the performance of models of varying sizes and pre-training approaches on multiple Norwegian speech datasets. Additionally, we measure the performance of these models against previous state-of-the-art ASR models, as well as on out-of-domain datasets. We improve the state of the art on the Norwegian Parliamentary Speech Corpus (NPSC) from a word error rate (WER) of 17.10\% to 7.60\%, with models achieving 5.81\% for Bokm{\aa}l and 11.54\% for Nynorsk. We also discuss the challenges and potential solutions for further improving ASR models for Norwegian.

**ABSTRACT**  
Spoken dialogue systems (SDSs) have been separately developed under two different categories, task-oriented and chit-chat. The former focuses on achieving functional goals and the latter aims at creating engaging social conversations without special goals. Creating a unified conversational model that can engage in both chit-chat and task-oriented dialogue is a promising research topic in recent years. However, the potential ``initiative'' that occurs when there is a change between dialogue modes in one dialogue has rarely been explored. In this work, we investigate two kinds of dialogue scenarios, one starts from chit-chat implicitly involving task-related topics and finally switching to task-oriented requests; the other starts from task-oriented interaction and eventually changes to casual chat after all requested information is provided. We contribute two efficient prompt models which can proactively generate a transition sentence to trigger system-initiated transitions in a unified dialogue model. One is a discrete prompt model trained with two discrete tokens, the other one is a continuous prompt model using continuous prompt embeddings automatically generated by a classifier. We furthermore show that the continuous prompt model can also be used to guide the proactive transitions between particular domains in a multi-domain task-oriented setting.

**ABSTRACT**  
Document understanding refers to automatically extract, analyze and comprehend information from various types of digital documents, such as a web page. Existing Multi-model Large Language Models (MLLMs), including mPLUG-Owl, have demonstrated promising zero-shot capabilities in shallow OCR-free text recognition, indicating their potential for OCR-free document understanding. Nevertheless, without in-domain training, these models tend to ignore fine-grained OCR features, such as sophisticated tables or large blocks of text, which are essential for OCR-free document understanding. In this paper, we propose mPLUG-DocOwl based on mPLUG-Owl for OCR-free document understanding. Specifically, we first construct a instruction tuning dataset featuring a wide range of visual-text understanding tasks. Then, we strengthen the OCR-free document understanding ability by jointly train the model on language-only, general vision-and-language, and document instruction tuning dataset with our unified instruction tuning strategy. We also build an OCR-free document instruction understanding evaluation set LLMDoc to better compare models' capabilities on instruct compliance and document understanding. Experimental results show that our model outperforms existing multi-modal models, demonstrating its strong ability of document understanding. Besides, without specific fine-tuning, mPLUG-DocOwl generalizes well on various downstream tasks. Our code, models, training data and evaluation set are available at https://github.com/X-PLUG/mPLUG-DocOwl.

**ABSTRACT**  
The knowledge-augmented deep learning paradigm refers to a paradigm in which domain knowledge is identified and integrated into deep models. Conventional methods typically employ task-specific approaches to gather external knowledge from various sources. In contrast, large language models are extensively pre-trained and can serve as a comprehensive source of external knowledge. In this paper, we propose CoT-KA, a Chain-of-Thought-based method that augments knowledge for deep learning. CoT-KA avoids the need for additional knowledge retrieval or knowledge reasoning models, as required in conventional augmentation methods. Our results demonstrate that CoT-KA outperforms both pure CoT-based methods and the non-augmented method across the majority of eleven publicly available benchmarks for various reasoning tasks.

**ABSTRACT**  
Grammatical error correction is one of the fundamental tasks in Natural Language Processing. For the Russian language, most of the spellcheckers available correct typos and other simple errors with high accuracy, but often fail when faced with non-native (L2) writing, since the latter contains errors that are not typical for native speakers. In this paper, we propose a pipeline involving a language model intended for correcting errors in L2 Russian writing. The language model proposed is trained on untagged texts of the Newspaper subcorpus of the Russian National Corpus, and the quality of the model is validated against the RULEC-GEC corpus.

**ABSTRACT**  
As the representation capability of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) improve, there is growing concern that they will inherit social biases from unprocessed corpora. Most previous debiasing techniques used Counterfactual Data Augmentation (CDA) to balance the training corpus. However, CDA slightly modifies the original corpus, limiting the representation distance between different demographic groups to a narrow range. As a result, the debiasing model easily fits the differences between counterfactual pairs, which affects its debiasing performance with limited text resources. In this paper, we propose an adversarial training-inspired two-stage debiasing model using Contrastive learning with Continuous Prompt Augmentation (named CCPA) to mitigate social biases in PLMs' encoding. In the first stage, we propose a data augmentation method based on continuous prompt tuning to push farther the representation distance between sample pairs along different demographic groups. In the second stage, we utilize contrastive learning to pull closer the representation distance between the augmented sample pairs and then fine-tune PLMs' parameters to get debiased encoding. Our approach guides the model to achieve stronger debiasing performance by adding difficulty to the training process. Extensive experiments show that CCPA outperforms baselines in terms of debiasing performance. Meanwhile, experimental results on the GLUE benchmark show that CCPA retains the language modeling capability of PLMs.

**ABSTRACT**  
Despite the huge progress in myriad generation tasks, pretrained language models (LMs) such as GPT2 still tend to generate repetitive texts with maximization-based decoding algorithms for open-ended generation. We attribute their overestimation of token-level repetition probabilities to the learning bias: LMs capture simple repetitive patterns faster with the MLE loss. We propose self-contrastive training to penalize the output of a premature checkpoint of the same model when it incorrectly predicts repetition, which is shown to mitigate repetition effectively while maintaining fluency on two datasets. Furthermore, we find that LMs use longer-range dependencies to predict repetitive tokens than non-repetitive ones, which may be the cause of sentence-level repetition loops.

**ABSTRACT**  
While understanding and removing gender biases in language models has been a long-standing problem in Natural Language Processing, prior research work has primarily been limited to English. In this work, we investigate some of the challenges with evaluating and mitigating biases in multilingual settings which stem from a lack of existing benchmarks and resources for bias evaluation beyond English especially for non-western context. In this paper, we first create a benchmark for evaluating gender biases in pre-trained masked language models by extending DisCo to different Indian languages using human annotations. We extend various debiasing methods to work beyond English and evaluate their effectiveness for SOTA massively multilingual models on our proposed metric. Overall, our work highlights the challenges that arise while studying social biases in multilingual settings and provides resources as well as mitigation techniques to take a step toward scaling to more languages.

**ABSTRACT**  
Despite their promising performance across various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, current NLP systems are vulnerable to textual adversarial attacks. To defend against these attacks, most existing methods apply adversarial training by incorporating adversarial examples. However, these methods have to rely on ground-truth labels to generate adversarial examples, rendering it impractical for large-scale model pre-training which is commonly used nowadays for NLP and many other tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel learning framework called SCAT (Self-supervised Contrastive Learning via Adversarial Training), which can learn robust representations without requiring labeled data. Specifically, SCAT modifies random augmentations of the data in a fully labelfree manner to generate adversarial examples. Adversarial training is achieved by minimizing the contrastive loss between the augmentations and their adversarial counterparts. We evaluate SCAT on two text classification datasets using two state-of-the-art attack schemes proposed recently. Our results show that SCAT can not only train robust language models from scratch, but it can also significantly improve the robustness of existing pre-trained language models. Moreover, to demonstrate its flexibility, we show that SCAT can also be combined with supervised adversarial training to further enhance model robustness.

**ABSTRACT**  
The recent advances in NLP, have led to a new trend of applying LLMs to real-world scenarios. While the latest LLMs are astonishingly fluent when interacting with humans, they suffer from the misinformation problem by unintentionally generating factually false statements. This can lead to harmful consequences, especially when produced within sensitive contexts, such as healthcare. Yet few previous works have focused on evaluating misinformation in the long-form generation of LLMs, especially for knowledge-intensive topics. Moreover, although LLMs have been shown to perform well in different languages, misinformation evaluation has been mostly conducted in English. To this end, we present a benchmark, CARE-MI, for evaluating LLM misinformation in: 1) a sensitive topic, specifically the maternity and infant care domain; and 2) a language other than English, namely Chinese. Most importantly, we provide an innovative paradigm for building long-form generation evaluation benchmarks that can be transferred to other knowledge-intensive domains and low-resourced languages. Our proposed benchmark fills the gap between the extensive usage of LLMs and the lack of datasets for assessing the misinformation generated by these models. It contains 1,612 expert-checked questions, accompanied with human-selected references. Using our benchmark, we conduct extensive experiments and found that current Chinese LLMs are far from perfect in the topic of maternity and infant care. In an effort to minimize the reliance on human resources for performance evaluation, we offer a judgment model for automatically assessing the long-form output of LLMs using the benchmark questions. Moreover, we compare potential solutions for long-form generation evaluation and provide insights for building more robust and efficient automated metric.

**ABSTRACT**  
There has been significant interest in zero and few-shot learning for dialogue state tracking (DST) due to the high cost of collecting and annotating task-oriented dialogues. Recent work has demonstrated that in-context learning requires very little data and zero parameter updates, and even outperforms trained methods in the few-shot setting (Hu et al. 2022). We propose RefPyDST, which advances the state of the art with three advancements to in-context learning for DST. First, we formulate DST as a Python programming task, explicitly modeling language coreference as variable reference in Python. Second, since in-context learning depends highly on the context examples, we propose a method to retrieve a diverse set of relevant examples to improve performance. Finally, we introduce a novel re-weighting method during decoding that takes into account probabilities of competing surface forms, and produces a more accurate dialogue state prediction. We evaluate our approach using MultiWOZ and achieve state-of-the-art multi-domain joint-goal accuracy in zero and few-shot settings.

**ABSTRACT**  
Prompts have been shown to be an effective method to adapt a frozen Pretrained Language Model (PLM) to perform well on downstream tasks. Prompts can be represented by a human-engineered word sequence or by a learned continuous embedding. In this work, we investigate conditional and compositional differentiable prompting. We propose a new model, Prompt Production System (PRopS), which learns to transform task instructions or input metadata, into continuous prompts that elicit task-specific outputs from the PLM. Our model uses a modular network structure based on our neural formulation of Production Systems, which allows the model to learn discrete rules -- neural functions that learn to specialize in transforming particular prompt input patterns, making it suitable for compositional transfer learning and few-shot learning. We present extensive empirical and theoretical analysis and show that PRopS consistently surpasses other PLM adaptation techniques, and often improves upon fully fine-tuned models, on compositional generalization tasks, controllable summarization and multilingual translation, while needing fewer trainable parameters.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper proposes exploiting the common sense knowledge learned by large language models to perform zero-shot reasoning about crimes given textual descriptions of surveillance videos. We show that when video is (manually) converted to high quality textual descriptions, large language models are capable of detecting and classifying crimes with state-of-the-art performance using only zero-shot reasoning. However, existing automated video-to-text approaches are unable to generate video descriptions of sufficient quality to support reasoning (garbage video descriptions into the large language model, garbage out).

In community question-answering platforms, tags play essential roles in effective information organization and retrieval, better question routing, faster response to questions, and assessment of topic popularity. Hence, automatic assistance for predicting and suggesting tags for posts is of high utility to users of such platforms. To develop better tag prediction across diverse communities and domains, we performed a thorough analysis of users' tagging behavior in 17 StackExchange communities. We found various common inherent properties of this behavior in those diverse domains. We used the findings to develop a flexible neural tag prediction architecture, which predicts both popular tags and more granular tags for each question. Our extensive experiments and obtained performance show the effectiveness of our model

**ABSTRACT**  
Novel digital data sources and tools like machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) have the potential to revolutionize data about development and can contribute to monitoring and mitigating humanitarian problems. The potential of applying novel technologies to solving some of humanity's most pressing issues has garnered interest outside the traditional disciplines studying and working on international development. Today, scientific communities in fields like Computational Social Science, Network Science, Complex Systems, Human Computer Interaction, Machine Learning, and the broader AI field are increasingly starting to pay attention to these pressing issues. However, are sophisticated data driven tools ready to be used for solving real-world problems with imperfect data and of staggering complexity? We outline the current state-of-the-art and identify barriers, which need to be surmounted in order for data-driven technologies to become useful in humanitarian and development contexts. We argue that, without organized and purposeful efforts, these new technologies risk at best falling short of promised goals, at worst they can increase inequality, amplify discrimination, and infringe upon human rights.

**ABSTRACT**  
The rapid advancement and widespread use of large language models (LLMs) have raised significant concerns regarding the potential leakage of personally identifiable information (PII). These models are often trained on vast quantities of web-collected data, which may inadvertently include sensitive personal data. This paper presents ProPILE, a novel probing tool designed to empower data subjects, or the owners of the PII, with awareness of potential PII leakage in LLM-based services. ProPILE lets data subjects formulate prompts based on their own PII to evaluate the level of privacy intrusion in LLMs. We demonstrate its application on the OPT-1.3B model trained on the publicly available Pile dataset. We show how hypothetical data subjects may assess the likelihood of their PII being included in the Pile dataset being revealed. ProPILE can also be leveraged by LLM service providers to effectively evaluate their own levels of PII leakage with more powerful prompts specifically tuned for their in-house models. This tool represents a pioneering step towards empowering the data subjects for their awareness and control over their own data on the web.

**ABSTRACT**  
Internet of things (IoT) has been playing an important role in many sectors, such as smart cities, smart agriculture, smart healthcare, and smart manufacturing. However, IoT devices are highly vulnerable to cyber-attacks, which may result in security breaches and data leakages. To effectively prevent these attacks, a variety of machine learning-based network intrusion detection methods for IoT networks have been developed, which often rely on either feature extraction or feature selection techniques for reducing the dimension of input data before being fed into machine learning models. This aims to make the detection complexity low enough for real-time operations, which is particularly vital in any intrusion detection systems. This paper provides a comprehensive comparison between these two feature reduction methods of intrusion detection in terms of various performance metrics, namely, precision rate, recall rate, detection accuracy, as well as runtime complexity, in the presence of the modern UNSW-NB15 dataset as well as both binary and multiclass classification. For example, in general, the feature selection method not only provides better detection performance but also lower training and inference time compared to its feature extraction counterpart, especially when the number of reduced features K increases. However, the feature extraction method is much more reliable than its selection counterpart, particularly when K is very small, such as K = 4. Additionally, feature extraction is less sensitive to changing the number of reduced features K than feature selection, and this holds true for both binary and multiclass classifications. Based on this comparison, we provide a useful guideline for selecting a suitable intrusion detection type for each specific scenario, as detailed in Tab. 14 at the end of Section IV.

**ABSTRACT**  
We study efficient mechanisms for differentially private kernel density estimation (DP-KDE). Prior work for the Gaussian kernel described algorithms that run in time exponential in the number of dimensions $d$. This paper breaks the exponential barrier, and shows how the KDE can privately be approximated in time linear in $d$, making it feasible for high-dimensional data. We also present improved bounds for low-dimensional data.   Our results are obtained through a general framework, which we term Locality Sensitive Quantization (LSQ), for constructing private KDE mechanisms where existing KDE approximation techniques can be applied. It lets us leverage several efficient non-private KDE methods -- like Random Fourier Features, the Fast Gauss Transform, and Locality Sensitive Hashing -- and ``privatize'' them in a black-box manner. Our experiments demonstrate that our resulting DP-KDE mechanisms are fast and accurate on large datasets in both high and low dimensions.

**ABSTRACT**  
For decades, the evolution of cooperation has piqued the interest of numerous academic disciplines such as game theory, economics, biology, and computer science. In this work, we demonstrate the emergence of a novel and effective resource exchange protocol formed by dropping and picking up resources in a foraging environment. This form of cooperation is made possible by the introduction of a campfire, which adds an extended period of congregation and downtime for agents to explore otherwise unlikely interactions. We find that the agents learn to avoid getting cheated by their exchange partners, but not always from a third party. We also observe the emergence of behavior analogous to tolerated theft, despite the lack of any punishment, combat, or larceny mechanism in the environment.

**ABSTRACT**  
Collaborative intelligence (CI) involves dividing an artificial intelligence (AI) model into two parts: front-end, to be deployed on an edge device, and back-end, to be deployed in the cloud. The deep feature tensors produced by the front-end are transmitted to the cloud through a communication channel, which may be subject to packet loss. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel approach to enhance the resilience of the CI system in the presence of packet loss through Unequal Loss Protection (ULP). The proposed ULP approach involves a feature importance estimator, which estimates the importance of feature packets produced by the front-end, and then selectively applies Forward Error Correction (FEC) codes to protect important packets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can significantly improve the reliability and robustness of the CI system in the presence of packet loss.

**ABSTRACT**  
Trustworthy deployment of deep learning medical imaging models into real-world clinical practice requires that they be calibrated. However, models that are well calibrated overall can still be poorly calibrated for a sub-population, potentially resulting in a clinician unwittingly making poor decisions for this group based on the recommendations of the model. Although methods have been shown to successfully mitigate biases across subgroups in terms of model accuracy, this work focuses on the open problem of mitigating calibration biases in the context of medical image analysis. Our method does not require subgroup attributes during training, permitting the flexibility to mitigate biases for different choices of sensitive attributes without re-training. To this end, we propose a novel two-stage method: Cluster-Focal to first identify poorly calibrated samples, cluster them into groups, and then introduce group-wise focal loss to improve calibration bias. We evaluate our method on skin lesion classification with the public HAM10000 dataset, and on predicting future lesional activity for multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. In addition to considering traditional sensitive attributes (e.g. age, sex) with demographic subgroups, we also consider biases among groups with different image-derived attributes, such as lesion load, which are required in medical image analysis. Our results demonstrate that our method effectively controls calibration error in the worst-performing subgroups while preserving prediction performance, and outperforming recent baselines.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recently, deep learning methods have been widely used for tumor segmentation of multimodal medical images with promising results. However, most existing methods are limited by insufficient representational ability, specific modality number and high computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a hybrid densely connected network for tumor segmentation, named H-DenseFormer, which combines the representational power of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the Transformer structures. Specifically, H-DenseFormer integrates a Transformer-based Multi-path Parallel Embedding (MPE) module that can take an arbitrary number of modalities as input to extract the fusion features from different modalities. Then, the multimodal fusion features are delivered to different levels of the encoder to enhance multimodal learning representation. Besides, we design a lightweight Densely Connected Transformer (DCT) block to replace the standard Transformer block, thus significantly reducing computational complexity. We conduct extensive experiments on two public multimodal datasets, HECKTOR21 and PI-CAI22. The experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods while having lower computational complexity.

**ABSTRACT**  
Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful approach for modelling and learning from graph-structured data. Multiple fields have since benefitted enormously from the capabilities of GNNs, such as recommendation systems, social network analysis, drug discovery, and robotics. However, accelerating and efficiently processing GNNs require a unique approach that goes beyond conventional artificial neural network accelerators, due to the substantial computational and memory requirements of GNNs. The slowdown of scaling in CMOS platforms also motivates a search for alternative implementation substrates. In this paper, we present GHOST, the first silicon-photonic hardware accelerator for GNNs. GHOST efficiently alleviates the costs associated with both vertex-centric and edge-centric operations. It implements separately the three main stages involved in running GNNs in the optical domain, allowing it to be used for the inference of various widely used GNN models and architectures, such as graph convolution networks and graph attention networks. Our simulation studies indicate that GHOST exhibits at least 10.2x better throughput and 3.8x better energy efficiency when compared to GPU, TPU, CPU and multiple state-of-the-art GNN hardware accelerators.

**ABSTRACT**  
Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) provide an energy-efficient deep learning option due to their unique spike-based event-driven (i.e., spike-driven) paradigm. In this paper, we incorporate the spike-driven paradigm into Transformer by the proposed Spike-driven Transformer with four unique properties: 1) Event-driven, no calculation is triggered when the input of Transformer is zero; 2) Binary spike communication, all matrix multiplications associated with the spike matrix can be transformed into sparse additions; 3) Self-attention with linear complexity at both token and channel dimensions; 4) The operations between spike-form Query, Key, and Value are mask and addition. Together, there are only sparse addition operations in the Spike-driven Transformer. To this end, we design a novel Spike-Driven Self-Attention (SDSA), which exploits only mask and addition operations without any multiplication, and thus having up to $87.2\times$ lower computation energy than vanilla self-attention. Especially in SDSA, the matrix multiplication between Query, Key, and Value is designed as the mask operation. In addition, we rearrange all residual connections in the vanilla Transformer before the activation functions to ensure that all neurons transmit binary spike signals. It is shown that the Spike-driven Transformer can achieve 77.1\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K, which is the state-of-the-art result in the SNN field.

**ABSTRACT**  
Can we develop a model that can synthesize realistic speech directly from a latent space, without explicit conditioning? Despite several efforts over the last decade, previous adversarial and diffusion-based approaches still struggle to achieve this, even on small-vocabulary datasets. To address this, we propose AudioStyleGAN (ASGAN) -- a generative adversarial network for unconditional speech synthesis tailored to learn a disentangled latent space. Building upon the StyleGAN family of image synthesis models, ASGAN maps sampled noise to a disentangled latent vector which is then mapped to a sequence of audio features so that signal aliasing is suppressed at every layer. To successfully train ASGAN, we introduce a number of new techniques, including a modification to adaptive discriminator augmentation which probabilistically skips discriminator updates. We apply it on the small-vocabulary Google Speech Commands digits dataset, where it achieves state-of-the-art results in unconditional speech synthesis. It is also substantially faster than existing top-performing diffusion models. We confirm that ASGAN's latent space is disentangled: we demonstrate how simple linear operations in the space can be used to perform several tasks unseen during training. Specifically, we perform evaluations in voice conversion, speech enhancement, speaker verification, and keyword classification. Our work indicates that GANs are still highly competitive in the unconditional speech synthesis landscape, and that disentangled latent spaces can be used to aid generalization to unseen tasks.

**ABSTRACT**  
Sixth-generation (6G) network slicing is the backbone of future communications systems. It inaugurates the era of extreme ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (xURLLC) and pervades the digitalization of the various vertical immersive use cases. Since 6G inherently underpins artificial intelligence (AI), we propose a systematic and standalone slice termed SliceOps that is natively embedded in the 6G architecture, which gathers and manages the whole AI lifecycle through monitoring, re-training, and deploying the machine learning (ML) models as a service for the 6G slices. By leveraging machine learning operations (MLOps) in conjunction with eXplainable AI (XAI), SliceOps strives to cope with the opaqueness of black-box AI using explanation-guided reinforcement learning (XRL) to fulfill transparency, trustworthiness, and interpretability in the network slicing ecosystem. This article starts by elaborating on the architectural and algorithmic aspects of SliceOps. Then, the deployed cloud-native SliceOps working is exemplified via a latency-aware resource allocation problem. The deep RL (DRL)-based SliceOps agents within slices provide AI services aiming to allocate optimal radio resources and impede service quality degradation. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of SliceOps-driven slicing. The article discusses afterward the SliceOps challenges and limitations. Finally, the key open research directions corresponding to the proposed approach are identified.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper delves into an advanced implementation of Chain-of-Thought-Prompting in Large Language Models, focusing on the use of tools (or "plug-ins") within the explicit reasoning paths generated by this prompting method. We find that tool-enabled conversational agents often become sidetracked, as additional context from tools like search engines or calculators diverts from original user intents. To address this, we explore a concept wherein the user becomes the tool, providing necessary details and refining their requests. Through Conversation Analysis, we characterize this interaction as insert-expansion - an intermediary conversation designed to facilitate the preferred response. We explore possibilities arising from this 'user-as-a-tool' approach in two empirical studies using direct comparison, and find benefits in the recommendation domain.

**ABSTRACT**  
Artificial intelligence's progress holds great promise in assisting society in addressing pressing societal issues. In particular Large Language Models (LLM) and the derived chatbots, like ChatGPT, have highly improved the natural language processing capabilities of AI systems allowing them to process an unprecedented amount of unstructured data. The consequent hype has also backfired, raising negative sentiment even after novel AI methods' surprising contributions. One of the causes, but also an important issue per se, is the rising and misleading feeling of being able to access and process any form of knowledge to solve problems in any domain with no effort or previous expertise in AI or problem domain, disregarding current LLMs limits, such as hallucinations and reasoning limits. Acknowledging AI fallibility is crucial to address the impact of dogmatic overconfidence in possibly erroneous suggestions generated by LLMs. At the same time, it can reduce fear and other negative attitudes toward AI. AI literacy interventions are necessary that allow the public to understand such LLM limits and learn how to use them in a more effective manner, i.e. learning to "prompt". With this aim, a pilot educational intervention was performed in a high school with 30 students. It involved (i) presenting high-level concepts about intelligence, AI, and LLM, (ii) an initial naive practice with ChatGPT in a non-trivial task, and finally (iii) applying currently-accepted prompting strategies. Encouraging preliminary results have been collected such as students reporting a) high appreciation of the activity, b) improved quality of the interaction with the LLM during the educational activity, c) decreased negative sentiments toward AI, d) increased understanding of limitations and specifically We aim to study factors that impact AI acceptance and to refine and repeat this activity in more controlled settings.

**ABSTRACT**  
On-chain data (metrics) of blockchain networks, akin to company fundamentals, provide crucial and comprehensive insights into the networks. Despite their informative nature, on-chain data have not been utilized in reinforcement learning (RL)-based systems for cryptocurrency (crypto) portfolio management (PM). An intriguing subject is the extent to which the utilization of on-chain data can enhance an RL-based system's return performance compared to baselines. Therefore, in this study, we propose CryptoRLPM, a novel RL-based system incorporating on-chain data for end-to-end crypto PM. CryptoRLPM consists of five units, spanning from information comprehension to trading order execution. In CryptoRLPM, the on-chain data are tested and specified for each crypto to solve the issue of ineffectiveness of metrics. Moreover, the scalable nature of CryptoRLPM allows changes in the portfolios' cryptos at any time. Backtesting results on three portfolios indicate that CryptoRLPM outperforms all the baselines in terms of accumulated rate of return (ARR), daily rate of return (DRR), and Sortino ratio (SR). Particularly, when compared to Bitcoin, CryptoRLPM enhances the ARR, DRR, and SR by at least 83.14%, 0.5603%, and 2.1767 respectively.

**ABSTRACT**  
To realize the potential benefits and mitigate potential risks of AI, it is necessary to develop a framework of governance that conforms to ethics and fundamental human values. Although several organizations have issued guidelines and ethical frameworks for trustworthy AI, without a mediating governance structure, these ethical principles will not translate into practice. In this paper, we propose a multilevel governance approach that involves three groups of interdependent stakeholders: governments, corporations, and citizens. We examine their interrelationships through dimensions of trust, such as competence, integrity, and benevolence. The levels of governance combined with the dimensions of trust in AI provide practical insights that can be used to further enhance user experiences and inform public policy related to AI.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper addresses the exploration-exploitation dilemma inherent in decision-making, focusing on multi-armed bandit problems. The problems involve an agent deciding whether to exploit current knowledge for immediate gains or explore new avenues for potential long-term rewards. We here introduce a novel algorithm, approximate information maximization (AIM), which employs an analytical approximation of the entropy gradient to choose which arm to pull at each point in time. AIM matches the performance of Infomax and Thompson sampling while also offering enhanced computational speed, determinism, and tractability. Empirical evaluation of AIM indicates its compliance with the Lai-Robbins asymptotic bound and demonstrates its robustness for a range of priors. Its expression is tunable, which allows for specific optimization in various settings.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper introduces the Multi-scale Feature Aggregation Conformer (MFA-Conformer) structure for audio anti-spoofing countermeasure (CM). MFA-Conformer combines a convolutional neural networkbased on the Transformer, allowing it to aggregate global andlocal information. This may benefit the anti-spoofing CM system to capture the synthetic artifacts hidden both locally and globally. In addition, given the excellent performance of MFA Conformer on automatic speech recognition (ASR) and automatic speaker verification (ASV) tasks, we present a transfer learning method that utilizes pretrained Conformer models on ASR or ASV tasks to enhance the robustness of CM systems. The proposed method is evaluated on both Chinese and Englishs poofing detection databases. On the FAD clean set, the MFA-Conformer model pretrained on the ASR task achieves an EER of 0.038%, which dramatically outperforms the baseline. Moreover, experimental results demonstrate that proposed transfer learning method on Conformer is effective on pure speech segments after voice activity detection processing.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recently, ''pre-training and fine-tuning'' has been adopted as a standard workflow for many graph tasks since it can take general graph knowledge to relieve the lack of graph annotations from each application. However, graph tasks with node level, edge level, and graph level are far diversified, making the pre-training pretext often incompatible with these multiple tasks. This gap may even cause a ''negative transfer'' to the specific application, leading to poor results. Inspired by the prompt learning in natural language processing (NLP), which has presented significant effectiveness in leveraging prior knowledge for various NLP tasks, we study the prompting topic for graphs with the motivation of filling the gap between pre-trained models and various graph tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-task prompting method for graph models. Specifically, we first unify the format of graph prompts and language prompts with the prompt token, token structure, and inserting pattern. In this way, the prompting idea from NLP can be seamlessly introduced to the graph area. Then, to further narrow the gap between various graph tasks and state-of-the-art pre-training strategies, we further study the task space of various graph applications and reformulate downstream problems to the graph-level task. Afterward, we introduce meta-learning to efficiently learn a better initialization for the multi-task prompt of graphs so that our prompting framework can be more reliable and general for different tasks. We conduct extensive experiments, results from which demonstrate the superiority of our method.

We show theoretically the potential to solve Bayesian inverse problems accurately with only a small number of numerical samples when the AI surrogate model error is small. Several numerical experiment results are included which demonstrates the advantage of the hybrid method.

**ABSTRACT**  
A novel human emotion recognition method based on automatically selected Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) signal features and SVM is proposed in this paper. GSR signals were acquired by e-Health Sensor Platform V2.0. Then, the data is de-noised by wavelet function and normalized to get rid of the individual difference. 30 features are extracted from the normalized data, however, directly using of these features will lead to a low recognition rate. In order to gain the optimized features, a covariance based feature selection is employed in our method. Finally, a SVM with input of the optimized features is utilized to achieve the human emotion recognition. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method leads to good human emotion recognition, and the recognition accuracy is more than 66.67%.
