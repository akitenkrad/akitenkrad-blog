**ABSTRACT**  
In recent decades, social network anonymization has become a crucial research field due to its pivotal role in preserving users' privacy. However, the high diversity of approaches introduced in relevant studies poses a challenge to gaining a profound understanding of the field. In response to this, the current study presents an exhaustive and well-structured bibliometric analysis of the social network anonymization field. To begin our research, related studies from the period of 2007-2022 were collected from the Scopus Database then pre-processed. Following this, the VOSviewer was used to visualize the network of authors' keywords. Subsequently, extensive statistical and network analyses were performed to identify the most prominent keywords and trending topics. Additionally, the application of co-word analysis through SciMAT and the Alluvial diagram allowed us to explore the themes of social network anonymization and scrutinize their evolution over time. These analyses culminated in an innovative taxonomy of the existing approaches and anticipation of potential trends in this domain. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first bibliometric analysis in the social network anonymization field, which offers a deeper understanding of the current state and an insightful roadmap for future research in this domain.

**ABSTRACT**  
The 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine was accompanied by a large-scale, pro-Russian propaganda campaign on social media. However, the strategy behind the dissemination of propaganda has remained unclear, particularly how the online discourse was strategically shaped by the propagandists' community. Here, we analyze the strategy of the Twitter community using an inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) approach. Specifically, IRL allows us to model online behavior as a Markov decision process, where the goal is to infer the underlying reward structure that guides propagandists when interacting with users with a supporting or opposing stance toward the invasion. Thereby, we aim to understand empirically whether and how between-user interactions are strategically used to promote the proliferation of Russian propaganda. For this, we leverage a large-scale dataset with 349,455 posts with pro-Russian propaganda from 132,131 users. We show that bots and humans follow a different strategy: bots respond predominantly to pro-invasion messages, suggesting that they seek to drive virality; while messages indicating opposition primarily elicit responses from humans, suggesting that they tend to engage in critical discussions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study analyzing the strategy behind propaganda from the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine through the lens of IRL.

**ABSTRACT**  
The popularity of online social networks has enabled rapid dissemination of information. People now can share and consume information much more rapidly than ever before. However, low-quality and/or accidentally/deliberately fake information can also spread rapidly. This can lead to considerable and negative impacts on society. Identifying, labelling and debunking online misinformation as early as possible has become an increasingly urgent problem. Many methods have been proposed to detect fake news including many deep learning and graph-based approaches. In recent years, graph-based methods have yielded strong results, as they can closely model the social context and propagation process of online news. In this paper, we present a systematic review of fake news detection studies based on graph-based and deep learning-based techniques. We classify existing graph-based methods into knowledge-driven methods, propagation-based methods, and heterogeneous social context-based methods, depending on how a graph structure is constructed to model news related information flows. We further discuss the challenges and open problems in graph-based fake news detection and identify future research directions.

**ABSTRACT**  
We present a novel method for mining opinions from text collections using generative language models trained on data collected from different populations. We describe the basic definitions, methodology and a generic algorithm for opinion insight mining. We demonstrate the performance of our method in an experiment where a pre-trained generative model is fine-tuned using specifically tailored content with unnatural and fully annotated opinions. We show that our approach can learn and transfer the opinions to the semantic classes while maintaining the proportion of polarisation. Finally, we demonstrate the usage of an insight mining system to scale up the discovery of opinion insights from a real text corpus.

**ABSTRACT**  
This guide introduces Large Language Models (LLM) as a highly versatile text analysis method within the social sciences. As LLMs are easy-to-use, cheap, fast, and applicable on a broad range of text analysis tasks, ranging from text annotation and classification to sentiment analysis and critical discourse analysis, many scholars believe that LLMs will transform how we do text analysis. This how-to guide is aimed at students and researchers with limited programming experience, and offers a simple introduction to how LLMs can be used for text analysis in your own research project, as well as advice on best practices. We will go through each of the steps of analyzing textual data with LLMs using Python: installing the software, setting up the API, loading the data, developing an analysis prompt, analyzing the text, and validating the results. As an illustrative example, we will use the challenging task of identifying populism in political texts, and show how LLMs move beyond the existing state-of-the-art.

**ABSTRACT**  
With the global increase in experimental data artifacts, harnessing them in a unified fashion leads to a major stumbling block - bad metadata. To bridge this gap, this work presents a Natural Language Processing (NLP) informed application, called FAIRMetaText, that compares metadata. Specifically, FAIRMetaText analyzes the natural language descriptions of metadata and provides a mathematical similarity measure between two terms. This measure can then be utilized for analyzing varied metadata, by suggesting terms for compliance or grouping similar terms for identification of replaceable terms. The efficacy of the algorithm is presented qualitatively and quantitatively on publicly available research artifacts and demonstrates large gains across metadata related tasks through an in-depth study of a wide variety of Large Language Models (LLMs). This software can drastically reduce the human effort in sifting through various natural language metadata while employing several experimental datasets on the same topic.

**ABSTRACT**  
Modern language models capture a large body of factual knowledge. However, some facts can be incorrectly induced or become obsolete over time, resulting in factually incorrect generations. This has led to the development of various editing methods that allow updating facts encoded by the model. Evaluation of these methods has primarily focused on testing whether an individual fact has been successfully injected, and if similar predictions for other subjects have not changed. Here we argue that such evaluation is limited, since injecting one fact (e.g. ``Jack Depp is the son of Johnny Depp'') introduces a ``ripple effect'' in the form of additional facts that the model needs to update (e.g.``Jack Depp is the sibling of Lily-Rose Depp''). To address this issue, we propose a novel set of evaluation criteria that consider the implications of an edit on related facts. Using these criteria, we then construct \ripple{}, a diagnostic benchmark of 5K factual edits, capturing a variety of types of ripple effects. We evaluate prominent editing methods on \ripple{}, showing that current methods fail to introduce consistent changes in the model's knowledge. In addition, we find that a simple in-context editing baseline obtains the best scores on our benchmark, suggesting a promising research direction for model editing.

**ABSTRACT**  
The zero-shot learning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) make them ideal for text classification without annotation or supervised training. Many studies have shown impressive results across multiple tasks. While tasks, data, and results differ widely, their similarities to human annotation can aid us in tackling new tasks with minimal expenses. We evaluate using 5 state-of-the-art LLMs as "annotators" on 5 different tasks (age, gender, topic, sentiment prediction, and hate speech detection), across 4 languages: English, French, German, and Spanish. No single model excels at all tasks, across languages, or across all labels within a task. However, aggregation techniques designed for human annotators perform substantially better than any one individual model. Overall, though, LLMs do not rival even simple supervised models, so they do not (yet) replace the need for human annotation. We also discuss the tradeoffs between speed, accuracy, cost, and bias when it comes to aggregated model labeling versus human annotation.

**ABSTRACT**  
Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on extensive textual corpora have emerged as leading solutions for a broad array of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Despite their notable performance, these models are prone to certain limitations such as misunderstanding human instructions, generating potentially biased content, or factually incorrect (hallucinated) information. Hence, aligning LLMs with human expectations has become an active area of interest within the research community. This survey presents a comprehensive overview of these alignment technologies, including the following aspects. (1) Data collection: the methods for effectively collecting high-quality instructions for LLM alignment, including the use of NLP benchmarks, human annotations, and leveraging strong LLMs. (2) Training methodologies: a detailed review of the prevailing training methods employed for LLM alignment. Our exploration encompasses Supervised Fine-tuning, both Online and Offline human preference training, along with parameter-efficient training mechanisms. (3) Model Evaluation: the methods for evaluating the effectiveness of these human-aligned LLMs, presenting a multifaceted approach towards their assessment. In conclusion, we collate and distill our findings, shedding light on several promising future research avenues in the field. This survey, therefore, serves as a valuable resource for anyone invested in understanding and advancing the alignment of LLMs to better suit human-oriented tasks and expectations.

**ABSTRACT**  
We propose Reinforcement Learning from Contrast Distillation (RLCD), a method for aligning language models to follow natural language principles without using human feedback. RLCD trains a preference model using simulated preference pairs that contain both a high-quality and low-quality example, generated using contrasting positive and negative prompts. The preference model is then used to improve a base unaligned language model via reinforcement learning. Empirically, RLCD outperforms RLAIF (Bai et al., 2022b) and context distillation (Huang et al., 2022) baselines across three diverse alignment tasks--harmlessness, helpfulness, and story outline generation--and on both 7B and 30B model scales for preference data simulation.

**ABSTRACT**  
Punctuation restoration is an important task in automatic speech recognition (ASR) which aim to restore the syntactic structure of generated ASR texts to improve readability. While punctuated texts are abundant from written documents, the discrepancy between written punctuated texts and ASR texts limits the usability of written texts in training punctuation restoration systems for ASR texts. This paper proposes a reinforcement learning method to exploit in-topic written texts and recent advances in large pre-trained generative language models to bridge this gap. The experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ASR test set on two benchmark datasets for punctuation restoration.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper presents a study on the feasibility of using large language models (LLM) for coding with low-resource and domain-specific programming languages that typically lack the amount of data required for effective LLM processing techniques. This study focuses on the econometric scripting language named hansl of the open-source software gretl and employs a proprietary LLM based on GPT-3.5. Our findings suggest that LLMs can be a useful tool for writing, understanding, improving, and documenting gretl code, which includes generating descriptive docstrings for functions and providing precise explanations for abstract and poorly documented econometric code. While the LLM showcased promoting docstring-to-code translation capability, we also identify some limitations, such as its inability to improve certain sections of code and to write accurate unit tests. This study is a step towards leveraging the power of LLMs to facilitate software development in low-resource programming languages and ultimately to lower barriers to entry for their adoption.

**ABSTRACT**  
Classic approaches to content moderation typically apply a rule-based heuristic approach to flag content. While rules are easily customizable and intuitive for humans to interpret, they are inherently fragile and lack the flexibility or robustness needed to moderate the vast amount of undesirable content found online today. Recent advances in deep learning have demonstrated the promise of using highly effective deep neural models to overcome these challenges. However, despite the improved performance, these data-driven models lack transparency and explainability, often leading to mistrust from everyday users and a lack of adoption by many platforms. In this paper, we present Rule By Example (RBE): a novel exemplar-based contrastive learning approach for learning from logical rules for the task of textual content moderation. RBE is capable of providing rule-grounded predictions, allowing for more explainable and customizable predictions compared to typical deep learning-based approaches. We demonstrate that our approach is capable of learning rich rule embedding representations using only a few data examples. Experimental results on 3 popular hate speech classification datasets show that RBE is able to outperform state-of-the-art deep learning classifiers as well as the use of rules in both supervised and unsupervised settings while providing explainable model predictions via rule-grounding.

**ABSTRACT**  
Despite the tremendous success of Neural Machine Translation (NMT), its performance on low-resource language pairs still remains subpar, partly due to the limited ability to handle previously unseen inputs, i.e., generalization. In this paper, we propose a method called Joint Dropout, that addresses the challenge of low-resource neural machine translation by substituting phrases with variables, resulting in significant enhancement of compositionality, which is a key aspect of generalization. We observe a substantial improvement in translation quality for language pairs with minimal resources, as seen in BLEU and Direct Assessment scores. Furthermore, we conduct an error analysis, and find Joint Dropout to also enhance generalizability of low-resource NMT in terms of robustness and adaptability across different domains

**ABSTRACT**  
Automatically summarizing radiology reports into a concise impression can reduce the manual burden of clinicians and improve the consistency of reporting. Previous work aimed to enhance content selection and factuality through guided abstractive summarization. However, two key issues persist. First, current methods heavily rely on domain-specific resources to extract the guidance signal, limiting their transferability to domains and languages where those resources are unavailable. Second, while automatic metrics like ROUGE show progress, we lack a good understanding of the errors and failure modes in this task. To bridge these gaps, we first propose a domain-agnostic guidance signal in form of variable-length extractive summaries. Our empirical results on two English benchmarks demonstrate that this guidance signal improves upon unguided summarization while being competitive with domain-specific methods. Additionally, we run an expert evaluation of four systems according to a taxonomy of 11 fine-grained errors. We find that the most pressing differences between automatic summaries and those of radiologists relate to content selection including omissions (up to 52%) and additions (up to 57%). We hypothesize that latent reporting factors and corpus-level inconsistencies may limit models to reliably learn content selection from the available data, presenting promising directions for future work.

**ABSTRACT**  
The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized machine learning and related fields, showcasing remarkable abilities in comprehending, generating, and manipulating human language. However, their conventional usage through API-based text prompt submissions imposes certain limitations in terms of context constraints and external source availability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework called Reinforced Retrieval Augmented Machine Learning (RRAML). RRAML integrates the reasoning capabilities of LLMs with supporting information retrieved by a purpose-built retriever from a vast user-provided database. By leveraging recent advancements in reinforcement learning, our method effectively addresses several critical challenges. Firstly, it circumvents the need for accessing LLM gradients. Secondly, our method alleviates the burden of retraining LLMs for specific tasks, as it is often impractical or impossible due to restricted access to the model and the computational intensity involved. Additionally we seamlessly link the retriever's task with the reasoner, mitigating hallucinations and reducing irrelevant, and potentially damaging retrieved documents. We believe that the research agenda outlined in this paper has the potential to profoundly impact the field of AI, democratizing access to and utilization of LLMs for a wide range of entities.

**ABSTRACT**  
Call Centers have huge amount of audio data which can be used for achieving valuable business insights and transcription of phone calls is manually tedious task. An effective Automated Speech Recognition system can accurately transcribe these calls for easy search through call history for specific context and content allowing automatic call monitoring, improving QoS through keyword search and sentiment analysis. ASR for Call Center requires more robustness as telephonic environment are generally noisy. Moreover, there are many low-resourced languages that are on verge of extinction which can be preserved with help of Automatic Speech Recognition Technology. Urdu is the $10^{th}$ most widely spoken language in the world, with 231,295,440 worldwide still remains a resource constrained language in ASR. Regional call-center conversations operate in local language, with a mix of English numbers and technical terms generally causing a "code-switching" problem. Hence, this paper describes an implementation framework of a resource efficient Automatic Speech Recognition/ Speech to Text System in a noisy call-center environment using Chain Hybrid HMM and CNN-TDNN for Code-Switched Urdu Language. Using Hybrid HMM-DNN approach allowed us to utilize the advantages of Neural Network with less labelled data. Adding CNN with TDNN has shown to work better in noisy environment due to CNN's additional frequency dimension which captures extra information from noisy speech, thus improving accuracy. We collected data from various open sources and labelled some of the unlabelled data after analysing its general context and content from Urdu language as well as from commonly used words from other languages, primarily English and were able to achieve WER of 5.2% with noisy as well as clean environment in isolated words or numbers as well as in continuous spontaneous speech.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recent advancements in natural language and Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled AI agents to simulate human-like interactions within virtual worlds. However, these interactions still face limitations in complexity and flexibility, particularly in scenarios involving multiple characters and novel objects. Pre-defining all interactable objects in the agent's world model presents challenges, and conveying implicit intentions to multiple characters through complex interactions remains difficult. To address these issues, we propose integrating virtual Game Masters (GMs) into the agent's world model, drawing inspiration from Tabletop Role-Playing Games (TRPGs). GMs play a crucial role in overseeing information, estimating players' intentions, providing environment descriptions, and offering feedback, compensating for current world model deficiencies. To facilitate future explorations for complex interactions, we introduce a benchmark named Tachikuma, comprising a Multiple character and novel Object based interaction Estimation (MOE) task and a supporting dataset. MOE challenges models to understand characters' intentions and accurately determine their actions within intricate contexts involving multi-character and novel object interactions. Besides, the dataset captures log data from real-time communications during gameplay, providing diverse, grounded, and complex interactions for further explorations. Finally, we present a simple prompting baseline and evaluate its performance, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing interaction understanding. We hope that our dataset and task will inspire further research in complex interactions with natural language, fostering the development of more advanced AI agents.

**ABSTRACT**  
Topic models have evolved from conventional Bayesian probabilistic models to Neural Topic Models (NTMs) over the last two decays. Although NTMs have achieved promising performance when trained and tested on a specific corpus, their generalisation ability across corpora is rarely studied. In practice, we often expect that an NTM trained on a source corpus can still produce quality topical representation for documents in a different target corpus without retraining. In this work, we aim to improve NTMs further so that their benefits generalise reliably across corpora and tasks. To do so, we propose to model similar documents by minimising their semantical distance when training NTMs. Specifically, similar documents are created by data augmentation during training; The semantical distance between documents is measured by the Hierarchical Topic Transport Distance (HOTT), which computes the Optimal Transport (OT) distance between the topical representations. Our framework can be readily applied to most NTMs as a plug-and-play module. Extensive experiments show that our framework significantly improves the generalisation ability regarding neural topical representation across corpora.

**ABSTRACT**  
Language Models today provide a high accuracy across a large number of downstream tasks. However, they remain susceptible to adversarial attacks, particularly against those where the adversarial examples maintain considerable similarity to the original text. Given the multilingual nature of text, the effectiveness of adversarial examples across translations and how machine translations can improve the robustness of adversarial examples remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study on the robustness of current text adversarial attacks to round-trip translation. We demonstrate that 6 state-of-the-art text-based adversarial attacks do not maintain their efficacy after round-trip translation. Furthermore, we introduce an intervention-based solution to this problem, by integrating Machine Translation into the process of adversarial example generation and demonstrating increased robustness to round-trip translation. Our results indicate that finding adversarial examples robust to translation can help identify the insufficiency of language models that is common across languages, and motivate further research into multilingual adversarial attacks.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this paper, we study the problem of secret language in NLP, where current language models (LMs) seem to have a hidden vocabulary that allows them to interpret absurd inputs as meaningful concepts. We investigate two research questions: ``Does the secret language phenomenon exist in different language models?'' and ``Does secret language depend on specific context?'' To answer these questions, we introduce a novel method named \textit{SecretFinding}, a gradient-based approach that can automatically discover secret languages in LMs. We conduct experiments on five representative models (Electra, ALBERT, Roberta, DistillBERT, and CLIP) finetuned on four NLP benchmarks (SST-2, MRPC, SNLI, and SQuAD) and a language-grounding benchmark (MSCOCO). Our experimental results show that even when we replace the most important words with others that are semantically dissimilar to the original words in a sentence, LMs do not consider the new sentence semantically dissimilar to the original, as the output does not change with a high probability. This phenomenon holds true across the five models and five tasks and gives a positive answer to the first research question. As for the second research question, we find that the secret language discovered by \textit{SecretFinding} is quite general and could even be transferred to other models in the black-box settings, such as GPT-3 and ChatGPT. Finally, we discuss the causes of secret language, how to eliminate it, the potential connection to memorization, and ethical implications. Examples of secret language found by SecretFinding are available on https://huggingface.co/spaces/anonymousauthors/ACL23_SecretLanguage.

**ABSTRACT**  
The research presented here uses the tools of Social Network Analysis to empirically show a socio-cultural phenomenon already addressed by the social sciences and history namely: the historical marginalisation of women in the field of cinema. The novelty of our approach lies in the use of a large amount of heterogeneous historical data. On the one hand, we built a network of interactions between people involved in the film field in Ibero-America during the first half of the twentieth century. On the other hand, we propose a $k$-core decomposition and a multi-layered analysis, as a quantitative way to study the position of women within the cultural melieu. After conducting our analysis, we concluded that women were mostly situated in the outer $k$-shells of the empirical network, and their distribution was not uniform across the $k$-shells. From a qualitative perspective, these results can be interpreted as the consequence of the lack of evidence of the participation of women in the public sphere.

**ABSTRACT**  
For more than a decade, researchers have measured progress in object recognition on ImageNet-based generalization benchmarks such as ImageNet-A, -C, and -R. Recent advances in foundation models, trained on orders of magnitude more data, have begun to saturate these standard benchmarks, but remain brittle in practice. This suggests standard benchmarks, which tend to focus on predefined or synthetic changes, may not be sufficient for measuring real world generalization. Consequently, we propose studying generalization across geography as a more realistic measure of progress using two datasets of objects from households across the globe. We conduct an extensive empirical evaluation of progress across nearly 100 vision models up to most recent foundation models. We first identify a progress gap between standard benchmarks and real-world, geographical shifts: progress on ImageNet results in up to 2.5x more progress on standard generalization benchmarks than real-world distribution shifts. Second, we study model generalization across geographies by measuring the disparities in performance across regions, a more fine-grained measure of real world generalization. We observe all models have large geographic disparities, even foundation CLIP models, with differences of 7-20% in accuracy between regions. Counter to modern intuition, we discover progress on standard benchmarks fails to improve geographic disparities and often exacerbates them: geographic disparities between the least performant models and today's best models have more than tripled. Our results suggest scaling alone is insufficient for consistent robustness to real-world distribution shifts. Finally, we highlight in early experiments how simple last layer retraining on more representative, curated data can complement scaling as a promising direction of future work, reducing geographic disparity on both benchmarks by over two-thirds.

**ABSTRACT**  
Large language models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been proven to excel at multiple tasks, such as commonsense reasoning. Powerful as these models can be, they are not grounded in the 3D physical world, which involves richer concepts such as spatial relationships, affordances, physics, layout, and so on. In this work, we propose to inject the 3D world into large language models and introduce a whole new family of 3D-LLMs. Specifically, 3D-LLMs can take 3D point clouds and their features as input and perform a diverse set of 3D-related tasks, including captioning, dense captioning, 3D question answering, task decomposition, 3D grounding, 3D-assisted dialog, navigation, and so on. Using three types of prompting mechanisms that we design, we are able to collect over 300k 3D-language data covering these tasks. To efficiently train 3D-LLMs, we first utilize a 3D feature extractor that obtains 3D features from rendered multi- view images. Then, we use 2D VLMs as our backbones to train our 3D-LLMs. By introducing a 3D localization mechanism, 3D-LLMs can better capture 3D spatial information. Experiments on ScanQA show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by a large margin (e.g., the BLEU-1 score surpasses state-of-the-art score by 9%). Furthermore, experiments on our held-in datasets for 3D captioning, task composition, and 3D-assisted dialogue show that our model outperforms 2D VLMs. Qualitative examples also show that our model could perform more tasks beyond the scope of existing LLMs and VLMs. Project Page: : https://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/3dllm/.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this paper, we propose a new operator, called 3D DeFormable Attention (DFA3D), for 2D-to-3D feature lifting, which transforms multi-view 2D image features into a unified 3D space for 3D object detection. Existing feature lifting approaches, such as Lift-Splat-based and 2D attention-based, either use estimated depth to get pseudo LiDAR features and then splat them to a 3D space, which is a one-pass operation without feature refinement, or ignore depth and lift features by 2D attention mechanisms, which achieve finer semantics while suffering from a depth ambiguity problem. In contrast, our DFA3D-based method first leverages the estimated depth to expand each view's 2D feature map to 3D and then utilizes DFA3D to aggregate features from the expanded 3D feature maps. With the help of DFA3D, the depth ambiguity problem can be effectively alleviated from the root, and the lifted features can be progressively refined layer by layer, thanks to the Transformer-like architecture. In addition, we propose a mathematically equivalent implementation of DFA3D which can significantly improve its memory efficiency and computational speed. We integrate DFA3D into several methods that use 2D attention-based feature lifting with only a few modifications in code and evaluate on the nuScenes dataset. The experiment results show a consistent improvement of +1.41\% mAP on average, and up to +15.1\% mAP improvement when high-quality depth information is available, demonstrating the superiority, applicability, and huge potential of DFA3D.

**ABSTRACT**  
Humans effortlessly grasp the connection between sketches and real-world objects, even when these sketches are far from realistic. Moreover, human sketch understanding goes beyond categorization -- critically, it also entails understanding how individual elements within a sketch correspond to parts of the physical world it represents. What are the computational ingredients needed to support this ability? Towards answering this question, we make two contributions: first, we introduce a new sketch-photo correspondence benchmark, $\textit{PSC6k}$, containing 150K annotations of 6250 sketch-photo pairs across 125 object categories, augmenting the existing Sketchy dataset with fine-grained correspondence metadata. Second, we propose a self-supervised method for learning dense correspondences between sketch-photo pairs, building upon recent advances in correspondence learning for pairs of photos. Our model uses a spatial transformer network to estimate the warp flow between latent representations of a sketch and photo extracted by a contrastive learning-based ConvNet backbone. We found that this approach outperformed several strong baselines and produced predictions that were quantitatively consistent with other warp-based methods. However, our benchmark also revealed systematic differences between predictions of the suite of models we tested and those of humans. Taken together, our work suggests a promising path towards developing artificial systems that achieve more human-like understanding of visual images at different levels of abstraction.

**ABSTRACT**  
With rapid advancements in depth sensors and deep learning, skeleton-based person re-identification (re-ID) models have recently achieved remarkable progress with many advantages. Most existing solutions learn single-level skeleton features from body joints with the assumption of equal skeleton importance, while they typically lack the ability to exploit more informative skeleton features from various levels such as limb level with more global body patterns. The label dependency of these methods also limits their flexibility in learning more general skeleton representations. This paper proposes a generic unsupervised Hierarchical skeleton Meta-Prototype Contrastive learning (Hi-MPC) approach with Hard Skeleton Mining (HSM) for person re-ID with unlabeled 3D skeletons. Firstly, we construct hierarchical representations of skeletons to model coarse-to-fine body and motion features from the levels of body joints, components, and limbs. Then a hierarchical meta-prototype contrastive learning model is proposed to cluster and contrast the most typical skeleton features ("prototypes") from different-level skeletons. By converting original prototypes into meta-prototypes with multiple homogeneous transformations, we induce the model to learn the inherent consistency of prototypes to capture more effective skeleton features for person re-ID. Furthermore, we devise a hard skeleton mining mechanism to adaptively infer the informative importance of each skeleton, so as to focus on harder skeletons to learn more discriminative skeleton representations. Extensive evaluations on five datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms a wide variety of state-of-the-art skeleton-based methods. We further show the general applicability of our method to cross-view person re-ID and RGB-based scenarios with estimated skeletons.

**ABSTRACT**  
Event-based sensors, with their high temporal resolution (1us) and dynamical range (120dB), have the potential to be deployed in high-speed platforms such as vehicles and drones. However, the highly sparse and fluctuating nature of events poses challenges for conventional object detection techniques based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). In contrast, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are well-suited for representing event-based data due to their inherent temporal dynamics. In particular, we demonstrate that the membrane potential dynamics can modulate network activity upon fluctuating events and strengthen features of sparse input. In addition, the spike-triggered adaptive threshold can stabilize training which further improves network performance. Based on this, we develop an efficient spiking feature pyramid network for event-based object detection. Our proposed SNN outperforms previous SNNs and sophisticated ANNs with attention mechanisms, achieving a mean average precision (map50) of 47.7% on the Gen1 benchmark dataset. This result significantly surpasses the previous best SNN by 9.7% and demonstrates the potential of SNNs for event-based vision. Our model has a concise architecture while maintaining high accuracy and much lower computation cost as a result of sparse computation. Our code will be publicly available.

**ABSTRACT**  
Since the training data for the target model in a data-free black-box attack is not available, most recent schemes utilize GANs to generate data for training substitute model. However, these GANs-based schemes suffer from low training efficiency as the generator needs to be retrained for each target model during the substitute training process, as well as low generation quality. To overcome these limitations, we consider utilizing the diffusion model to generate data, and propose a data-free black-box attack scheme based on diffusion model to improve the efficiency and accuracy of substitute training. Despite the data generated by the diffusion model exhibits high quality, it presents diverse domain distributions and contains many samples that do not meet the discriminative criteria of the target model. To further facilitate the diffusion model to generate data suitable for the target model, we propose a Latent Code Augmentation (LCA) method to guide the diffusion model in generating data. With the guidance of LCA, the data generated by the diffusion model not only meets the discriminative criteria of the target model but also exhibits high diversity. By utilizing this data, it is possible to train substitute model that closely resemble the target model more efficiently. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our LCA achieves higher attack success rates and requires fewer query budgets compared to GANs-based schemes for different target models.

**ABSTRACT**  
Detecting objects based on language descriptions is a popular task that includes Open-Vocabulary object Detection (OVD) and Referring Expression Comprehension (REC). In this paper, we advance them to a more practical setting called Described Object Detection (DOD) by expanding category names to flexible language expressions for OVD and overcoming the limitation of REC to only grounding the pre-existing object. We establish the research foundation for DOD tasks by constructing a Description Detection Dataset ($D^3$), featuring flexible language expressions and annotating all described objects without omission. By evaluating previous SOTA methods on $D^3$, we find some troublemakers that fail current REC, OVD, and bi-functional methods. REC methods struggle with confidence scores, rejecting negative instances, and multi-target scenarios, while OVD methods face constraints with long and complex descriptions. Recent bi-functional methods also do not work well on DOD due to their separated training procedures and inference strategies for REC and OVD tasks. Building upon the aforementioned findings, we propose a baseline that largely improves REC methods by reconstructing the training data and introducing a binary classification sub-task, outperforming existing methods.

**ABSTRACT**  
Medical imaging is a key component in clinical diagnosis, treatment planning and clinical trial design, accounting for almost 90% of all healthcare data. CNNs achieved performance gains in medical image analysis (MIA) over the last years. CNNs can efficiently model local pixel interactions and be trained on small-scale MI data. The main disadvantage of typical CNN models is that they ignore global pixel relationships within images, which limits their generalisation ability to understand out-of-distribution data with different 'global' information. The recent progress of Artificial Intelligence gave rise to Transformers, which can learn global relationships from data. However, full Transformer models need to be trained on large-scale data and involve tremendous computational complexity. Attention and Transformer compartments (Transf/Attention) which can well maintain properties for modelling global relationships, have been proposed as lighter alternatives of full Transformers. Recently, there is an increasing trend to co-pollinate complementary local-global properties from CNN and Transf/Attention architectures, which led to a new era of hybrid models. The past years have witnessed substantial growth in hybrid CNN-Transf/Attention models across diverse MIA problems. In this systematic review, we survey existing hybrid CNN-Transf/Attention models, review and unravel key architectural designs, analyse breakthroughs, and evaluate current and future opportunities as well as challenges. We also introduced a comprehensive analysis framework on generalisation opportunities of scientific and clinical impact, based on which new data-driven domain generalisation and adaptation methods can be stimulated.

**ABSTRACT**  
CLIP has become a promising language-supervised visual pre-training framework and achieves excellent performance over a wide range of tasks. This paper aims to distill small CLIP models supervised by a large teacher CLIP model. We propose several distillation strategies, including relation, feature, gradient and contrastive paradigm, to examine the impact on CLIP distillation. We show that the simplest feature mimicry with MSE loss performs best. Moreover, interactive contrastive learning and relation-based distillation are also critical in performance improvement. We apply the unified method to distill several student networks trained on 15 million (image, text) pairs. Distillation improves the student CLIP models consistently over zero-shot ImageNet classification and cross-modal retrieval benchmarks. We hope our empirical study will become an important baseline for future CLIP distillation research. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/winycg/CLIP-KD}.

**ABSTRACT**  
Unsupervised anomaly detection in medical images such as chest radiographs is stepping into the spotlight as it mitigates the scarcity of the labor-intensive and costly expert annotation of anomaly data. However, nearly all existing methods are formulated as a one-class classification trained only on representations from the normal class and discard a potentially significant portion of the unlabeled data. This paper focuses on a more practical setting, dual distribution anomaly detection for chest X-rays, using the entire training data, including both normal and unlabeled images. Inspired by a modern self-supervised vision transformer model trained using partial image inputs to reconstruct missing image regions -- we propose AMAE, a two-stage algorithm for adaptation of the pre-trained masked autoencoder (MAE). Starting from MAE initialization, AMAE first creates synthetic anomalies from only normal training images and trains a lightweight classifier on frozen transformer features. Subsequently, we propose an adaptation strategy to leverage unlabeled images containing anomalies. The adaptation scheme is accomplished by assigning pseudo-labels to unlabeled images and using two separate MAE based modules to model the normative and anomalous distributions of pseudo-labeled images. The effectiveness of the proposed adaptation strategy is evaluated with different anomaly ratios in an unlabeled training set. AMAE leads to consistent performance gains over competing self-supervised and dual distribution anomaly detection methods, setting the new state-of-the-art on three public chest X-ray benchmarks: RSNA, NIH-CXR, and VinDr-CXR.

**ABSTRACT**  
CT images corrupted by metal artifacts have serious negative effects on clinical diagnosis. Considering the difficulty of collecting paired data with ground truth in clinical settings, unsupervised methods for metal artifact reduction are of high interest. However, it is difficult for previous unsupervised methods to retain structural information from CT images while handling the non-local characteristics of metal artifacts. To address these challenges, we proposed a novel Dense Transformer based Enhanced Coding Network (DTEC-Net) for unsupervised metal artifact reduction. Specifically, we introduce a Hierarchical Disentangling Encoder, supported by the high-order dense process, and transformer to obtain densely encoded sequences with long-range correspondence. Then, we present a second-order disentanglement method to improve the dense sequence's decoding process. Extensive experiments and model discussions illustrate DTEC-Net's effectiveness, which outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods on a benchmark dataset, and greatly reduces metal artifacts while restoring richer texture details.

**ABSTRACT**  
Self-supervised learning of visual representations has been focusing on learning content features, which do not capture object motion or location, and focus on identifying and differentiating objects in images and videos. On the other hand, optical flow estimation is a task that does not involve understanding the content of the images on which it is estimated. We unify the two approaches and introduce MC-JEPA, a joint-embedding predictive architecture and self-supervised learning approach to jointly learn optical flow and content features within a shared encoder, demonstrating that the two associated objectives; the optical flow estimation objective and the self-supervised learning objective; benefit from each other and thus learn content features that incorporate motion information. The proposed approach achieves performance on-par with existing unsupervised optical flow benchmarks, as well as with common self-supervised learning approaches on downstream tasks such as semantic segmentation of images and videos.

**ABSTRACT**  
In past decade, previous balanced datasets have been used to advance algorithms for classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, and anomaly detection in industrial applications. Specifically, for condition-based maintenance, automating visual inspection is crucial to ensure high quality. Deterioration prognostic attempts to optimize the fine decision process for predictive maintenance and proactive repair. In civil infrastructure and living environment, damage data mining cannot avoid the imbalanced data issue because of rare unseen events and high quality status by improved operations. For visual inspection, deteriorated class acquired from the surface of concrete and steel components are occasionally imbalanced. From numerous related surveys, we summarize that imbalanced data problems can be categorized into four types; 1) missing range of target and label valuables, 2) majority-minority class imbalance, 3) foreground-background of spatial imbalance, 4) long-tailed class of pixel-wise imbalance. Since 2015, there has been many imbalanced studies using deep learning approaches that includes regression, image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation. However, anomaly detection for imbalanced data is not yet well known. In the study, we highlight one-class anomaly detection application whether anomalous class or not, and demonstrate clear examples on imbalanced vision datasets: wooden, concrete deterioration, and disaster damage. We provide key results on damage vision mining advantage, hypothesizing that the more effective range of positive ratio, the higher accuracy gain of anomaly detection application. Finally, the applicability of the damage learning methods, limitations, and future works are mentioned.

**ABSTRACT**  
Inspired by the fact that the matrix formulated by nonlocal similar patches in a natural image is of low rank, the rank approximation issue have been extensively investigated over the past decades, among which weighted nuclear norm minimization (WNNM) and weighted Schatten $p$-norm minimization (WSNM) are two prevailing methods have shown great superiority in various image restoration (IR) problems. Due to the physical characteristic of color images, color image restoration (CIR) is often a much more difficult task than its grayscale image counterpart. However, when applied to CIR, the traditional WNNM/WSNM method only processes three color channels individually and fails to consider their cross-channel correlations. Very recently, a quaternion-based WNNM approach (QWNNM) has been developed to mitigate this issue, which is capable of representing the color image as a whole in the quaternion domain and preserving the inherent correlation among the three color channels. Despite its empirical success, unfortunately, the convergence behavior of QWNNM has not been strictly studied yet. In this paper, on the one side, we extend the WSNM into quaternion domain and correspondingly propose a novel quaternion-based WSNM model (QWSNM) for tackling the CIR problems. Extensive experiments on two representative CIR tasks, including color image denoising and deblurring, demonstrate that the proposed QWSNM method performs favorably against many state-of-the-art alternatives, in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. On the other side, more importantly, we preliminarily provide a theoretical convergence analysis, that is, by modifying the quaternion alternating direction method of multipliers (QADMM) through a simple continuation strategy, we theoretically prove that both the solution sequences generated by the QWNNM and QWSNM have fixed-point convergence guarantees.

**ABSTRACT**  
One of the main challenges in LiDAR-based 3D object detection is that the sensors often fail to capture the complete spatial information about the objects due to long distance and occlusion. Two-stage detectors with point cloud completion approaches tackle this problem by adding more points to the regions of interest (RoIs) with a pre-trained network. However, these methods generate dense point clouds of objects for all region proposals, assuming that objects always exist in the RoIs. This leads to the indiscriminate point generation for incorrect proposals as well. Motivated by this, we propose Point Generation R-CNN (PG-RCNN), a novel end-to-end detector that generates semantic surface points of foreground objects for accurate detection. Our method uses a jointly trained RoI point generation module to process the contextual information of RoIs and estimate the complete shape and displacement of foreground objects. For every generated point, PG-RCNN assigns a semantic feature that indicates the estimated foreground probability. Extensive experiments show that the point clouds generated by our method provide geometrically and semantically rich information for refining false positive and misaligned proposals. PG-RCNN achieves competitive performance on the KITTI benchmark, with significantly fewer parameters than state-of-the-art models. The code is available at https://github.com/quotation2520/PG-RCNN.

**ABSTRACT**  
Medical image segmentation has made significant progress when a large amount of labeled data are available. However, annotating medical image segmentation datasets is expensive due to the requirement of professional skills. Additionally, classes are often unevenly distributed in medical images, which severely affects the classification performance on minority classes. To address these problems, this paper proposes Co-Distribution Alignment (Co-DA) for semi-supervised medical image segmentation. Specifically, Co-DA aligns marginal predictions on unlabeled data to marginal predictions on labeled data in a class-wise manner with two differently initialized models before using the pseudo-labels generated by one model to supervise the other. Besides, we design an over-expectation cross-entropy loss for filtering the unlabeled pixels to reduce noise in their pseudo-labels. Quantitative and qualitative experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art semi-supervised medical image segmentation methods on both the 2D CaDIS dataset and the 3D LGE-MRI and ACDC datasets, achieving an mIoU of 0.8515 with only 24% labeled data on CaDIS, and a Dice score of 0.8824 and 0.8773 with only 20% data on LGE-MRI and ACDC, respectively.

**ABSTRACT**  
DETR-like models have significantly boosted the performance of detectors and even outperformed classical convolutional models. However, all tokens are treated equally without discrimination brings a redundant computational burden in the traditional encoder structure. The recent sparsification strategies exploit a subset of informative tokens to reduce attention complexity maintaining performance through the sparse encoder. But these methods tend to rely on unreliable model statistics. Moreover, simply reducing the token population hinders the detection performance to a large extent, limiting the application of these sparse models. We propose Focus-DETR, which focuses attention on more informative tokens for a better trade-off between computation efficiency and model accuracy. Specifically, we reconstruct the encoder with dual attention, which includes a token scoring mechanism that considers both localization and category semantic information of the objects from multi-scale feature maps. We efficiently abandon the background queries and enhance the semantic interaction of the fine-grained object queries based on the scores. Compared with the state-of-the-art sparse DETR-like detectors under the same setting, our Focus-DETR gets comparable complexity while achieving 50.4AP (+2.2) on COCO.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recent advancements in large-scale Vision Transformers have made significant strides in improving pre-trained models for medical image segmentation. However, these methods face a notable challenge in acquiring a substantial amount of pre-training data, particularly within the medical field. To address this limitation, we present Masked Multi-view with Swin Transformers (SwinMM), a novel multi-view pipeline for enabling accurate and data-efficient self-supervised medical image analysis. Our strategy harnesses the potential of multi-view information by incorporating two principal components. In the pre-training phase, we deploy a masked multi-view encoder devised to concurrently train masked multi-view observations through a range of diverse proxy tasks. These tasks span image reconstruction, rotation, contrastive learning, and a novel task that employs a mutual learning paradigm. This new task capitalizes on the consistency between predictions from various perspectives, enabling the extraction of hidden multi-view information from 3D medical data. In the fine-tuning stage, a cross-view decoder is developed to aggregate the multi-view information through a cross-attention block. Compared with the previous state-of-the-art self-supervised learning method Swin UNETR, SwinMM demonstrates a notable advantage on several medical image segmentation tasks. It allows for a smooth integration of multi-view information, significantly boosting both the accuracy and data-efficiency of the model.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this paper, we strive to answer the question "how to collaboratively learn convolutional neural network (CNN)-based and vision transformer (ViT)-based models by selecting and exchanging the reliable knowledge between them for semantic segmentation?" Accordingly, we propose an online knowledge distillation (KD) framework that can simultaneously learn compact yet effective CNN-based and ViT-based models with two key technical breakthroughs to take full advantage of CNNs and ViT while compensating their limitations. Firstly, we propose heterogeneous feature distillation (HFD) to improve students' consistency in low-layer feature space by mimicking heterogeneous features between CNNs and ViT. Secondly, to facilitate the two students to learn reliable knowledge from each other, we propose bidirectional selective distillation (BSD) that can dynamically transfer selective knowledge. This is achieved by 1) region-wise BSD determining the directions of knowledge transferred between the corresponding regions in the feature space and 2) pixel-wise BSD discerning which of the prediction knowledge to be transferred in the logit space. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art online distillation methods by a large margin, and shows its efficacy in learning collaboratively between ViT-based and CNN-based models.

**ABSTRACT**  
Document dewarping from a distorted camera-captured image is of great value for OCR and document understanding. The document boundary plays an important role which is more evident than the inner region in document dewarping. Current learning-based methods mainly focus on complete boundary cases, leading to poor document correction performance of documents with incomplete boundaries. In contrast to these methods, this paper proposes MataDoc, the first method focusing on arbitrary boundary document dewarping with margin and text aware regularizations. Specifically, we design the margin regularization by explicitly considering background consistency to enhance boundary perception. Moreover, we introduce word position consistency to keep text lines straight in rectified document images. To produce a comprehensive evaluation of MataDoc, we propose a novel benchmark ArbDoc, mainly consisting of document images with arbitrary boundaries in four typical scenarios. Extensive experiments confirm the superiority of MataDoc with consideration for the incomplete boundary on ArbDoc and also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on DocUNet, DIR300, and WarpDoc datasets.

**ABSTRACT**  
Video anomaly detection (VAD) has been paid increasing attention due to its potential applications, its current dominant tasks focus on online detecting anomalies% at the frame level, which can be roughly interpreted as the binary or multiple event classification. However, such a setup that builds relationships between complicated anomalous events and single labels, e.g., ``vandalism'', is superficial, since single labels are deficient to characterize anomalous events. In reality, users tend to search a specific video rather than a series of approximate videos. Therefore, retrieving anomalous events using detailed descriptions is practical and positive but few researches focus on this. In this context, we propose a novel task called Video Anomaly Retrieval (VAR), which aims to pragmatically retrieve relevant anomalous videos by cross-modalities, e.g., language descriptions and synchronous audios. Unlike the current video retrieval where videos are assumed to be temporally well-trimmed with short duration, VAR is devised to retrieve long untrimmed videos which may be partially relevant to the given query. To achieve this, we present two large-scale VAR benchmarks, UCFCrime-AR and XDViolence-AR, constructed on top of prevalent anomaly datasets. Meanwhile, we design a model called Anomaly-Led Alignment Network (ALAN) for VAR. In ALAN, we propose an anomaly-led sampling to focus on key segments in long untrimmed videos. Then, we introduce an efficient pretext task to enhance semantic associations between video-text fine-grained representations. Besides, we leverage two complementary alignments to further match cross-modal contents. Experimental results on two benchmarks reveal the challenges of VAR task and also demonstrate the advantages of our tailored method.

**ABSTRACT**  
The core idea of visual anomaly detection is to learn the normality from normal images, but previous works have been developed specifically for certain tasks, leading to fragmentation among various tasks: defect detection, semantic anomaly detection, multi-class anomaly detection, and anomaly clustering. This one-task-one-model approach is resource-intensive and incurs high maintenance costs as the number of tasks increases. This paper presents SelFormaly, a universal and powerful anomaly detection framework. We emphasize the necessity of our off-the-shelf approach by pointing out a suboptimal issue with fluctuating performance in previous online encoder-based methods. In addition, we question the effectiveness of using ConvNets as previously employed in the literature and confirm that self-supervised ViTs are suitable for unified anomaly detection. We introduce back-patch masking and discover the new role of top k-ratio feature matching to achieve unified and powerful anomaly detection. Back-patch masking eliminates irrelevant regions that possibly hinder target-centric detection with representations of the scene layout. The top k-ratio feature matching unifies various anomaly levels and tasks. Finally, SelFormaly achieves state-of-the-art results across various datasets for all the aforementioned tasks.

**ABSTRACT**  
Pre-training has been widely adopted in deep learning to improve model performance, especially when the training data for a target task is limited. In our work, we seek to understand the implications of this training strategy on the generalization properties of downstream models. More specifically, we ask the following question: how do properties of the pre-training distribution affect the robustness of a fine-tuned model? The properties we explore include the label space, label semantics, image diversity, data domains, and data quantity of the pre-training distribution. We find that the primary factor influencing downstream effective robustness (Taori et al., 2020) is data quantity, while other factors have limited significance. For example, reducing the number of ImageNet pre-training classes by 4x while increasing the number of images per class by 4x (that is, keeping total data quantity fixed) does not impact the robustness of fine-tuned models. We demonstrate our findings on pre-training distributions drawn from various natural and synthetic data sources, primarily using the iWildCam-WILDS distribution shift as a test for downstream robustness.

**ABSTRACT**  
Knowledge Graph (KG) plays a crucial role in Medical Report Generation (MRG) because it reveals the relations among diseases and thus can be utilized to guide the generation process. However, constructing a comprehensive KG is labor-intensive and its applications on the MRG process are under-explored. In this study, we establish a complete KG on chest X-ray imaging that includes 137 types of diseases and abnormalities. Based on this KG, we find that the current MRG data sets exhibit a long-tailed problem in disease distribution. To mitigate this problem, we introduce a novel augmentation strategy that enhances the representation of disease types in the tail-end of the distribution. We further design a two-stage MRG approach, where a classifier is first trained to detect whether the input images exhibit any abnormalities. The classified images are then independently fed into two transformer-based generators, namely, ``disease-specific generator" and ``disease-free generator" to generate the corresponding reports. To enhance the clinical evaluation of whether the generated reports correctly describe the diseases appearing in the input image, we propose diverse sensitivity (DS), a new metric that checks whether generated diseases match ground truth and measures the diversity of all generated diseases. Results show that the proposed two-stage generation framework and augmentation strategies improve DS by a considerable margin, indicating a notable reduction in the long-tailed problem associated with under-represented diseases.

**ABSTRACT**  
This paper focuses on an accurate and fast interpolation approach for image transformation employed in the design of CNN architectures. Standard Spatial Transformer Networks (STNs) use bilinear or linear interpolation as their interpolation, with unrealistic assumptions about the underlying data distributions, which leads to poor performance under scale variations. Moreover, STNs do not preserve the norm of gradients in propagation due to their dependency on sparse neighboring pixels. To address this problem, a novel Entropy STN (ESTN) is proposed that interpolates on the data manifold distributions. In particular, random samples are generated for each pixel in association with the tangent space of the data manifold and construct a linear approximation of their intensity values with an entropy regularizer to compute the transformer parameters. A simple yet effective technique is also proposed to normalize the non-zero values of the convolution operation, to fine-tune the layers for gradients' norm-regularization during training. Experiments on challenging benchmarks show that the proposed ESTN can improve predictive accuracy over a range of computer vision tasks, including image reconstruction, and classification, while reducing the computational cost.

**ABSTRACT**  
Text-driven diffusion models have exhibited impressive generative capabilities, enabling various image editing tasks. In this paper, we propose TF-ICON, a novel Training-Free Image COmpositioN framework that harnesses the power of text-driven diffusion models for cross-domain image-guided composition. This task aims to seamlessly integrate user-provided objects into a specific visual context. Current diffusion-based methods often involve costly instance-based optimization or finetuning of pretrained models on customized datasets, which can potentially undermine their rich prior. In contrast, TF-ICON can leverage off-the-shelf diffusion models to perform cross-domain image-guided composition without requiring additional training, finetuning, or optimization. Moreover, we introduce the exceptional prompt, which contains no information, to facilitate text-driven diffusion models in accurately inverting real images into latent representations, forming the basis for compositing. Our experiments show that equipping Stable Diffusion with the exceptional prompt outperforms state-of-the-art inversion methods on various datasets (CelebA-HQ, COCO, and ImageNet), and that TF-ICON surpasses prior baselines in versatile visual domains.

**ABSTRACT**  
Owing to the advances in image processing technology and large-scale datasets, companies have implemented facial authentication processes, thereby stimulating increased focus on face anti-spoofing (FAS) against realistic presentation attacks. Recently, various attempts have been made to improve face recognition performance using both global and local learning on face images; however, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate whether the robustness of FAS against domain shifts is improved by considering global information and local cues in face images captured using self-attention and convolutional layers. This study proposes a convolutional vision transformer-based framework that achieves robust performance for various unseen domain data. Our model resulted in 7.3%$p$ and 12.9%$p$ increases in FAS performance compared to models using only a convolutional neural network or vision transformer, respectively. It also shows the highest average rank in sub-protocols of cross-dataset setting over the other nine benchmark models for domain generalization.

**ABSTRACT**  
Automatic protein function prediction (AFP) is classified as a large-scale multi-label classification problem aimed at automating protein enrichment analysis to eliminate the current reliance on labor-intensive wet-lab methods. Currently, popular methods primarily combine protein-related information and Gene Ontology (GO) terms to generate final functional predictions. For example, protein sequences, structural information, and protein-protein interaction networks are integrated as prior knowledge to fuse with GO term embeddings and generate the ultimate prediction results. However, these methods are limited by the difficulty in obtaining structural information or network topology information, as well as the accuracy of such data. Therefore, more and more methods that only use protein sequences for protein function prediction have been proposed, which is a more reliable and computationally cheaper approach. However, the existing methods fail to fully extract feature information from protein sequences or label data because they do not adequately consider the intrinsic characteristics of the data itself. Therefore, we propose a sequence-based hierarchical prediction method, DeepGATGO, which processes protein sequences and GO term labels hierarchically, and utilizes graph attention networks (GATs) and contrastive learning for protein function prediction. Specifically, we compute embeddings of the sequence and label data using pre-trained models to reduce computational costs and improve the embedding accuracy. Then, we use GATs to dynamically extract the structural information of non-Euclidean data, and learn general features of the label dataset with contrastive learning by constructing positive and negative example samples. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model exhibits better scalability in GO term enrichment analysis on large-scale datasets.

**ABSTRACT**  
Deep learning has become a popular tool for medical image analysis, but the limited availability of training data remains a major challenge, particularly in the medical field where data acquisition can be costly and subject to privacy regulations. Data augmentation techniques offer a solution by artificially increasing the number of training samples, but these techniques often produce limited and unconvincing results. To address this issue, a growing number of studies have proposed the use of deep generative models to generate more realistic and diverse data that conform to the true distribution of the data. In this review, we focus on three types of deep generative models for medical image augmentation: variational autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, and diffusion models. We provide an overview of the current state of the art in each of these models and discuss their potential for use in different downstream tasks in medical imaging, including classification, segmentation, and cross-modal translation. We also evaluate the strengths and limitations of each model and suggest directions for future research in this field. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive review about the use of deep generative models for medical image augmentation and to highlight the potential of these models for improving the performance of deep learning algorithms in medical image analysis.

However, neonates are sensitive and contact-based sensors present challenges in comfort, hygiene, and skin health, especially for preterm babies. As a step toward fully automatic, continuous, and contactless respiratory monitoring, we develop a deep-learning method for estimating respiratory rate and waveform from plain video footage in natural settings. Our automated infant respiration flow-based network (AIRFlowNet) combines video-extracted optical flow input and spatiotemporal convolutional processing tuned to the infant domain. We support our model with the first public annotated infant respiration dataset with 125 videos (AIR-125), drawn from eight infant subjects, set varied pose, lighting, and camera conditions. We include manual respiration annotations and optimize AIRFlowNet training on them using a novel spectral bandpass loss function. When trained and tested on the AIR-125 infant data, our method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in respiratory rate estimation, achieving a mean absolute error of $\sim$2.9 breaths per minute, compared to $\sim$4.7--6.2 for other public models designed for adult subjects and more uniform environments.

**ABSTRACT**  
Graph-based neural network models are gaining traction in the field of representation learning due to their ability to uncover latent topological relationships between entities that are otherwise challenging to identify. These models have been employed across a diverse range of domains, encompassing drug discovery, protein interactions, semantic segmentation, and fluid dynamics research. In this study, we investigate the potential of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for medical image classification. We introduce a novel model that combines GNNs and edge convolution, leveraging the interconnectedness of RGB channel feature values to strongly represent connections between crucial graph nodes. Our proposed model not only performs on par with state-of-the-art Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) but does so with 1000 times fewer parameters, resulting in reduced training time and data requirements. We compare our Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCNN) to pre-trained DNNs for classifying MedMNIST dataset classes, revealing promising prospects for GNNs in medical image analysis. Our results also encourage further exploration of advanced graph-based models such as Graph Attention Networks (GAT) and Graph Auto-Encoders in the medical imaging domain. The proposed model yields more reliable, interpretable, and accurate outcomes for tasks like semantic segmentation and image classification compared to simpler GCNNs

**ABSTRACT**  
Single image super-resolution (SISR) is a challenging ill-posed problem that aims to up-sample a given low-resolution (LR) image to a high-resolution (HR) counterpart. Due to the difficulty in obtaining real LR-HR training pairs, recent approaches are trained on simulated LR images degraded by simplified down-sampling operators, e.g., bicubic. Such an approach can be problematic in practice because of the large gap between the synthesized and real-world LR images. To alleviate the issue, we propose a novel Invertible scale-Conditional Function (ICF), which can scale an input image and then restore the original input with different scale conditions. By leveraging the proposed ICF, we construct a novel self-supervised SISR framework (ICF-SRSR) to handle the real-world SR task without using any paired/unpaired training data. Furthermore, our ICF-SRSR can generate realistic and feasible LR-HR pairs, which can make existing supervised SISR networks more robust. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in handling SISR in a fully self-supervised manner. Our ICF-SRSR demonstrates superior performance compared to the existing methods trained on synthetic paired images in real-world scenarios and exhibits comparable performance compared to state-of-the-art supervised/unsupervised methods on public benchmark datasets.

**ABSTRACT**  
In dynamic Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), k-space is typically undersampled due to limited scan time, resulting in aliasing artifacts in the image domain. Hence, dynamic MR reconstruction requires not only modeling spatial frequency components in the x and y directions of k-space but also considering temporal redundancy. Most previous works rely on image-domain regularizers (priors) to conduct MR reconstruction. In contrast, we focus on interpolating the undersampled k-space before obtaining images with Fourier transform. In this work, we connect masked image modeling with k-space interpolation and propose a novel Transformer-based k-space Global Interpolation Network, termed k-GIN. Our k-GIN learns global dependencies among low- and high-frequency components of 2D+t k-space and uses it to interpolate unsampled data. Further, we propose a novel k-space Iterative Refinement Module (k-IRM) to enhance the high-frequency components learning. We evaluate our approach on 92 in-house 2D+t cardiac MR subjects and compare it to MR reconstruction methods with image-domain regularizers. Experiments show that our proposed k-space interpolation method quantitatively and qualitatively outperforms baseline methods. Importantly, the proposed approach achieves substantially higher robustness and generalizability in cases of highly-undersampled MR data.

**ABSTRACT**  
One of the hallmark symptoms of Parkinson's Disease (PD) is the progressive loss of postural reflexes, which eventually leads to gait difficulties and balance problems. Identifying disruptions in brain function associated with gait impairment could be crucial in better understanding PD motor progression, thus advancing the development of more effective and personalized therapeutics. In this work, we present an explainable, geometric, weighted-graph attention neural network (xGW-GAT) to identify functional networks predictive of the progression of gait difficulties in individuals with PD. xGW-GAT predicts the multi-class gait impairment on the MDS Unified PD Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS). Our computational- and data-efficient model represents functional connectomes as symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices on a Riemannian manifold to explicitly encode pairwise interactions of entire connectomes, based on which we learn an attention mask yielding individual- and group-level explainability. Applied to our resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) dataset of individuals with PD, xGW-GAT identifies functional connectivity patterns associated with gait impairment in PD and offers interpretable explanations of functional subnetworks associated with motor impairment. Our model successfully outperforms several existing methods while simultaneously revealing clinically-relevant connectivity patterns.

**ABSTRACT**  
As deep learning models continue to advance and are increasingly utilized in real-world systems, the issue of robustness remains a major challenge. Existing certified training methods produce models that achieve high provable robustness guarantees at certain perturbation levels. However, the main problem of such models is a dramatically low standard accuracy, i.e. accuracy on clean unperturbed data, that makes them impractical. In this work, we consider a more realistic perspective of maximizing the robustness of a model at certain levels of (high) standard accuracy. To this end, we propose a novel certified training method based on a key insight that training with adaptive certified radii helps to improve both the accuracy and robustness of the model, advancing state-of-the-art accuracy-robustness tradeoffs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and TinyImageNet datasets. Particularly, on CIFAR-10 and TinyImageNet, our method yields models with up to two times higher robustness, measured as an average certified radius of a test set, at the same levels of standard accuracy compared to baseline approaches.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this work, we investigate the problem of out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization for unsupervised learning methods on graph data. This scenario is particularly challenging because graph neural networks (GNNs) have been shown to be sensitive to distributional shifts, even when labels are available. To address this challenge, we propose a \underline{M}odel-\underline{A}gnostic \underline{R}ecipe for \underline{I}mproving \underline{O}OD generalizability of unsupervised graph contrastive learning methods, which we refer to as MARIO. MARIO introduces two principles aimed at developing distributional-shift-robust graph contrastive methods to overcome the limitations of existing frameworks: (i) Information Bottleneck (IB) principle for achieving generalizable representations and (ii) Invariant principle that incorporates adversarial data augmentation to obtain invariant representations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that investigates the OOD generalization problem of graph contrastive learning, with a specific focus on node-level tasks. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the OOD test set, while maintaining comparable performance on the in-distribution test set when compared to existing approaches.

**ABSTRACT**  
Reinforcement learning is time-consuming for complex tasks due to the need for large amounts of training data. Recent advances in GPU-based simulation, such as Isaac Gym, have sped up data collection thousands of times on a commodity GPU. Most prior works used on-policy methods like PPO due to their simplicity and ease of scaling. Off-policy methods are more data efficient but challenging to scale, resulting in a longer wall-clock training time. This paper presents a Parallel $Q$-Learning (PQL) scheme that outperforms PPO in wall-clock time while maintaining superior sample efficiency of off-policy learning. PQL achieves this by parallelizing data collection, policy learning, and value learning. Different from prior works on distributed off-policy learning, such as Apex, our scheme is designed specifically for massively parallel GPU-based simulation and optimized to work on a single workstation. In experiments, we demonstrate that $Q$-learning can be scaled to \textit{tens of thousands of parallel environments} and investigate important factors affecting learning speed.

**ABSTRACT**  
The Adam optimizer is the standard choice in deep learning applications. I propose a simple explanation of Adam's success: it makes each parameter's step size independent of the norms of the other parameters. Based on this principle I derive Iso, a new optimizer which makes the norm of a parameter's update invariant to the application of any linear transformation to its inputs and outputs. I develop a variant of Iso called IsoAdam that allows optimal hyperparameters to be transferred from Adam, and demonstrate that IsoAdam obtains a speedup over Adam when training a small Transformer.

**ABSTRACT**  
A crucial task in decision-making problems is reward engineering. It is common in practice that no obvious choice of reward function exists. Thus, a popular approach is to introduce human feedback during training and leverage such feedback to learn a reward function. Among all policy learning methods that use human feedback, preference-based methods have demonstrated substantial success in recent empirical applications such as InstructGPT. In this work, we develop a theory that provably shows the benefits of preference-based methods in offline contextual bandits. In particular, we improve the modeling and suboptimality analysis for running policy learning methods on human-scored samples directly. Then, we compare it with the suboptimality guarantees of preference-based methods and show that preference-based methods enjoy lower suboptimality.

**ABSTRACT**  
As with any machine learning problem with limited data, effective offline RL algorithms require careful regularization to avoid overfitting. One-step methods perform regularization by doing just a single step of policy improvement, while critic regularization methods do many steps of policy improvement with a regularized objective. These methods appear distinct. One-step methods, such as advantage-weighted regression and conditional behavioral cloning, truncate policy iteration after just one step. This ``early stopping'' makes one-step RL simple and stable, but can limit its asymptotic performance. Critic regularization typically requires more compute but has appealing lower-bound guarantees. In this paper, we draw a close connection between these methods: applying a multi-step critic regularization method with a regularization coefficient of 1 yields the same policy as one-step RL. While practical implementations violate our assumptions and critic regularization is typically applied with smaller regularization coefficients, our experiments nevertheless show that our analysis makes accurate, testable predictions about practical offline RL methods (CQL and one-step RL) with commonly-used hyperparameters. Our results that every problem can be solved with a single step of policy improvement, but rather that one-step RL might be competitive with critic regularization on RL problems that demand strong regularization.

**ABSTRACT**  
Supply chain management relies on accurate backorder prediction for optimizing inventory control, reducing costs, and enhancing customer satisfaction. However, traditional machine-learning models struggle with large-scale datasets and complex relationships, hindering real-world data collection. This research introduces a novel methodological framework for supply chain backorder prediction, addressing the challenge of handling large datasets. Our proposed model, QAmplifyNet, employs quantum-inspired techniques within a quantum-classical neural network to predict backorders effectively on short and imbalanced datasets. Experimental evaluations on a benchmark dataset demonstrate QAmplifyNet's superiority over classical models, quantum ensembles, quantum neural networks, and deep reinforcement learning. Its proficiency in handling short, imbalanced datasets makes it an ideal solution for supply chain management. To enhance model interpretability, we use Explainable Artificial Intelligence techniques. Practical implications include improved inventory control, reduced backorders, and enhanced operational efficiency. QAmplifyNet seamlessly integrates into real-world supply chain management systems, enabling proactive decision-making and efficient resource allocation. Future work involves exploring additional quantum-inspired techniques, expanding the dataset, and investigating other supply chain applications. This research unlocks the potential of quantum computing in supply chain optimization and paves the way for further exploration of quantum-inspired machine learning models in supply chain management. Our framework and QAmplifyNet model offer a breakthrough approach to supply chain backorder prediction, providing superior performance and opening new avenues for leveraging quantum-inspired techniques in supply chain management.

**ABSTRACT**  
Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have recently achieved better generalization and sample efficiency in autonomous web navigation. However, the performance on real-world websites has still suffered from (1) open domainness, (2) limited context length, and (3) lack of inductive bias on HTML. We introduce WebAgent, an LLM-driven agent that can complete the tasks on real websites following natural language instructions. WebAgent plans ahead by decomposing instructions into canonical sub-instructions, summarizes long HTML documents into task-relevant snippets, and acts on websites via generated Python programs from those. We design WebAgent with Flan-U-PaLM, for grounded code generation, and HTML-T5, new pre-trained LLMs for long HTML documents using local and global attention mechanisms and a mixture of long-span denoising objectives, for planning and summarization. We empirically demonstrate that our recipe improves the success on a real website by over 50%, and that HTML-T5 is the best model to solve HTML-based tasks; achieving 14.9% higher success rate than prior SoTA on the MiniWoB web navigation benchmark and better accuracy on offline task planning evaluation.

**ABSTRACT**  
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have enabled major advances in image classification through convolution and pooling. In particular, image pooling transforms a connected discrete lattice into a reduced lattice with the same connectivity and allows reduction functions to consider all pixels in an image. However, there is no pooling that satisfies these properties for graphs. In fact, traditional graph pooling methods suffer from at least one of the following drawbacks: Graph disconnection or overconnection, low decimation ratio, and deletion of large parts of graphs. In this paper, we present three pooling methods based on the notion of maximal independent sets that avoid these pitfalls. Our experimental results confirm the relevance of maximal independent set constraints for graph pooling.

**ABSTRACT**  
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved notable success in learning from graph-structured data, owing to their ability to capture intricate dependencies and relationships between nodes. They excel in various applications, including semi-supervised node classification, link prediction, and graph generation. However, it is important to acknowledge that the majority of state-of-the-art GNN models are built upon the assumption of an in-distribution setting, which hinders their performance on real-world graphs with dynamic structures. In this article, we aim to assess the impact of training GNNs on localized subsets of the graph. Such restricted training data may lead to a model that performs well in the specific region it was trained on but fails to generalize and make accurate predictions for the entire graph. In the context of graph-based semi-supervised learning (SSL), resource constraints often lead to scenarios where the dataset is large, but only a portion of it can be labeled, affecting the model's performance. This limitation affects tasks like anomaly detection or spam detection when labeling processes are biased or influenced by human subjectivity. To tackle the challenges posed by localized training data, we approach the problem as an out-of-distribution (OOD) data issue by by aligning the distributions between the training data, which represents a small portion of labeled data, and the graph inference process that involves making predictions for the entire graph. We propose a regularization method to minimize distributional discrepancies between localized training data and graph inference, improving model performance on OOD data. Extensive tests on popular GNN models show significant performance improvement on three citation GNN benchmark datasets. The regularization approach effectively enhances model adaptation and generalization, overcoming challenges posed by OOD data.

**ABSTRACT**  
For Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to become useful in safety-critical applications, such as self-driving cars and disease diagnosis, they must be stable to perturbations in input and model parameters. Characterizing the sensitivity of a DNN to perturbations is necessary to determine minimal bit-width precision that may be used to safely represent the network. However, no general result exists that is capable of predicting the sensitivity of a given DNN to round-off error, noise, or other perturbations in input. This paper derives an estimator that can predict such quantities. The estimator is derived via inequalities and matrix norms, and the resulting quantity is roughly analogous to a condition number for the entire neural network. An approximation of the estimator is tested on two Convolutional Neural Networks, AlexNet and VGG-19, using the ImageNet dataset. For each of these networks, the tightness of the estimator is explored via random perturbations and adversarial attacks.

**ABSTRACT**  
The generation of high-quality, long-sequenced time-series data is essential due to its wide range of applications. In the past, standalone Recurrent and Convolutional Neural Network-based Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) were used to synthesize time-series data. However, they are inadequate for generating long sequences of time-series data due to limitations in the architecture. Furthermore, GANs are well known for their training instability and mode collapse problem. To address this, we propose TransFusion, a diffusion, and transformers-based generative model to generate high-quality long-sequence time-series data. We have stretched the sequence length to 384, and generated high-quality synthetic data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that has been done with this long-sequence length. Also, we introduce two evaluation metrics to evaluate the quality of the synthetic data as well as its predictive characteristics. We evaluate TransFusion with a wide variety of visual and empirical metrics, and TransFusion outperforms the previous state-of-the-art by a significant margin.

**ABSTRACT**  
Counterfactual inference for continuous rather than binary treatment variables is more common in real-world causal inference tasks. While there are already some sample reweighting methods based on Marginal Structural Model for eliminating the confounding bias, they generally focus on removing the treatment's linear dependence on confounders and rely on the accuracy of the assumed parametric models, which are usually unverifiable. In this paper, we propose a de-confounding representation learning (DRL) framework for counterfactual outcome estimation of continuous treatment by generating the representations of covariates disentangled with the treatment variables. The DRL is a non-parametric model that eliminates both linear and nonlinear dependence between treatment and covariates. Specifically, we train the correlations between the de-confounded representations and the treatment variables against the correlations between the covariate representations and the treatment variables to eliminate confounding bias. Further, a counterfactual inference network is embedded into the framework to make the learned representations serve both de-confounding and trusted inference. Extensive experiments on synthetic datasets show that the DRL model performs superiorly in learning de-confounding representations and outperforms state-of-the-art counterfactual inference models for continuous treatment variables. In addition, we apply the DRL model to a real-world medical dataset MIMIC and demonstrate a detailed causal relationship between red cell width distribution and mortality.

We develop a transformer-based sequence-to-sequence model that recovers scalar ordinary differential equations (ODEs) in symbolic form from irregularly sampled and noisy observations of a single solution trajectory. We demonstrate in extensive empirical evaluations that our model performs better or on par with existing methods in terms of accurate recovery across various settings. Moreover, our method is efficiently scalable: after one-time pretraining on a large set of ODEs, we can infer the governing law of a new observed solution in a few forward passes of the model.

**ABSTRACT**  
Neural network models are widely used in a variety of domains, often as black-box solutions, since they are not directly interpretable for humans. The field of explainable artificial intelligence aims at developing explanation methods to address this challenge, and several approaches have been developed over the recent years, including methods for investigating what type of knowledge these models internalise during the training process. Among these, the method of concept detection, investigates which \emph{concepts} neural network models learn to represent in order to complete their tasks. In this work, we present an extension to the method of concept detection, named \emph{concept backpropagation}, which provides a way of analysing how the information representing a given concept is internalised in a given neural network model. In this approach, the model input is perturbed in a manner guided by a trained concept probe for the described model, such that the concept of interest is maximised. This allows for the visualisation of the detected concept directly in the input space of the model, which in turn makes it possible to see what information the model depends on for representing the described concept. We present results for this method applied to a various set of input modalities, and discuss how our proposed method can be used to visualise what information trained concept probes use, and the degree as to which the representation of the probed concept is entangled within the neural network model itself.

**ABSTRACT**  
We investigate adversarial robustness of unsupervised Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) against structural attacks. First, we provide a comprehensive empirical and theoretical analysis of existing attacks, revealing how and why they downgrade the performance of GCL. Inspired by our analytic results, we present a robust GCL framework that integrates a homophily-driven sanitation view, which can be learned jointly with contrastive learning. A key challenge this poses, however, is the non-differentiable nature of the sanitation objective. To address this challenge, we propose a series of techniques to enable gradient-based end-to-end robust GCL. Moreover, we develop a fully unsupervised hyperparameter tuning method which, unlike prior approaches, does not require knowledge of node labels. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of our proposed model, GCHS (Graph Contrastive Learning with Homophily-driven Sanitation View), against two state of the art structural attacks on GCL. Our results demonstrate that GCHS consistently outperforms all state of the art baselines in terms of the quality of generated node embeddings as well as performance on two important downstream tasks.

**ABSTRACT**  
Landslide is a natural disaster that can easily threaten local ecology, people's lives and property. In this paper, we conduct modelling research on real unidirectional surface displacement data of recent landslides in the research area and propose a time series prediction framework named VMD-SegSigmoid-XGBoost-ClusterLSTM (VSXC-LSTM) based on variational mode decomposition, which can predict the landslide surface displacement more accurately. The model performs well on the test set. Except for the random item subsequence that is hard to fit, the root mean square error (RMSE) and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of the trend item subsequence and the periodic item subsequence are both less than 0.1, and the RMSE is as low as 0.006 for the periodic item prediction module based on XGBoost\footnote{Accepted in ICANN2023}.

**ABSTRACT**  
Unrestricted adversarial attacks present a serious threat to deep learning models and adversarial defense techniques. They pose severe security problems for deep learning applications because they can effectively bypass defense mechanisms. However, previous attack methods often utilize Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which are not theoretically provable and thus generate unrealistic examples by incorporating adversarial objectives, especially for large-scale datasets like ImageNet. In this paper, we propose a new method, called AdvDiff, to generate unrestricted adversarial examples with diffusion models. We design two novel adversarial guidance techniques to conduct adversarial sampling in the reverse generation process of diffusion models. These two techniques are effective and stable to generate high-quality, realistic adversarial examples by integrating gradients of the target classifier interpretably. Experimental results on MNIST and ImageNet datasets demonstrate that AdvDiff is effective to generate unrestricted adversarial examples, which outperforms GAN-based methods in terms of attack performance and generation quality.

**ABSTRACT**  
To learn accurate representations of molecules, it is essential to consider both chemical and geometric features. To encode geometric information, many descriptors have been proposed in constrained circumstances for specific types of molecules and do not have the properties to be ``robust": 1. Invariant to rotations and translations; 2. Injective when embedding molecular structures. In this work, we propose a universal and robust Directional Node Pair (DNP) descriptor based on the graph representations of 3D molecules. Our DNP descriptor is robust compared to previous ones and can be applied to multiple molecular types. To combine the DNP descriptor and chemical features in molecules, we construct the Robust Molecular Graph Convolutional Network (RoM-GCN) which is capable to take both node and edge features into consideration when generating molecule representations. We evaluate our model on protein and small molecule datasets. Our results validate the superiority of the DNP descriptor in incorporating 3D geometric information of molecules. RoM-GCN outperforms all compared baselines.

**ABSTRACT**  
Graph neural networks (GNNs) update the hidden representations of vertices (called Vertex-GNNs) or hidden representations of edges (called Edge-GNNs) by processing and pooling the information of neighboring vertices and edges and combining to incorporate graph topology. When learning resource allocation policies, GNNs cannot perform well if their expressive power are weak, i.e., if they cannot differentiate all input features such as channel matrices. In this paper, we analyze the expressive power of the Vertex-GNNs and Edge-GNNs for learning three representative wireless policies: link scheduling, power control, and precoding policies. We find that the expressive power of the GNNs depend on the linearity and output dimensions of the processing and combination functions. When linear processors are used, the Vertex-GNNs cannot differentiate all channel matrices due to the loss of channel information, while the Edge-GNNs can. When learning the precoding policy, even the Vertex-GNNs with non-linear processors may not be with strong expressive ability due to the dimension compression. We proceed to provide necessary conditions for the GNNs to well learn the precoding policy. Simulation results validate the analyses and show that the Edge-GNNs can achieve the same performance as the Vertex-GNNs with much lower training and inference time.

**ABSTRACT**  
Simulating quantum systems is one of the most promising avenues to harness the computational power of quantum computers. However, hardware errors in noisy near-term devices remain a major obstacle for applications. Ideas based on the randomization of Suzuki-Trotter product formulas have been shown to be a powerful approach to reducing the errors of quantum simulation and lowering the gate count. In this paper, we study the performance of non-unitary simulation channels and consider the error structure of channels constructed from a weighted average of unitary circuits. We show that averaging over just a few simulation circuits can significantly reduce the Trotterization error for both single-step short-time and multi-step long-time simulations. We focus our analysis on two approaches for constructing circuit ensembles for averaging: (i) permuting the order of the terms in the Hamiltonian and (ii) applying a set of global symmetry transformations. We compare our analytical error bounds to empirical performance and show that empirical error reduction surpasses our analytical estimates in most cases. Finally, we test our method on an IonQ trapped-ion quantum computer accessed via the Amazon Braket cloud platform, and benchmark the performance of the averaging approach.

**ABSTRACT**  
Consider the spiked Wigner model \[ X = \sum_{i = 1}^k \lambda_i u_i u_i^\top + \sigma G, \] where $G$ is an $N \times N$ GOE random matrix, and the eigenvalues $\lambda_i$ are all spiked, i.e. above the Baik-Ben Arous-P\'ech\'e (BBP) threshold $\sigma$. We consider AIC-type model selection criteria of the form \[ -2 \, (\text{maximised log-likelihood}) + \gamma \, (\text{number of parameters}) \] for estimating the number $k$ of spikes. For $\gamma > 2$, the above criterion is strongly consistent provided $\lambda_k > \lambda_{\gamma}$, where $\lambda_{\gamma}$ is a threshold strictly above the BBP threshold, whereas for $\gamma < 2$, it almost surely overestimates $k$. Although AIC (which corresponds to $\gamma = 2$) is not strongly consistent, we show that taking $\gamma = 2 + \delta_N$, where $\delta_N \to 0$ and $\delta_N \gg N^{-2/3}$, results in a weakly consistent estimator of $k$. We also show that a certain soft minimiser of AIC is strongly consistent.

**ABSTRACT**  
The legitimacy of bottom-up democratic processes for the distribution of public funds by policy-makers is challenging and complex. Participatory budgeting is such a process, where voting outcomes may not always be fair or inclusive. Deliberation for which project ideas to put for voting and choose for implementation lack systematization and do not scale. This paper addresses these grand challenges by introducing a novel and legitimate iterative consensus-based participatory budgeting process. Consensus is designed to be a result of decision support via an innovative multi-agent reinforcement learning approach. Voters are assisted to interact with each other to make viable compromises. Extensive experimental evaluation with real-world participatory budgeting data from Poland reveal striking findings: Consensus is reachable, efficient and robust. Compromise is required, which is though comparable to the one of existing voting aggregation methods that promote fairness and inclusion without though attaining consensus.

**ABSTRACT**  
Automated program analysis is a pivotal research domain in many areas of Computer Science -- Formal Methods and Artificial Intelligence, in particular. Due to the undecidability of the problem of program equivalence, comparing two programs is highly challenging. Typically, in order to compare two programs, a relation between both programs' sets of variables is required. Thus, mapping variables between two programs is useful for a panoply of tasks such as program equivalence, program analysis, program repair, and clone detection. In this work, we propose using graph neural networks (GNNs) to map the set of variables between two programs based on both programs' abstract syntax trees (ASTs). To demonstrate the strength of variable mappings, we present three use-cases of these mappings on the task of program repair to fix well-studied and recurrent bugs among novice programmers in introductory programming assignments (IPAs). Experimental results on a dataset of 4166 pairs of incorrect/correct programs show that our approach correctly maps 83% of the evaluation dataset. Moreover, our experiments show that the current state-of-the-art on program repair, greatly dependent on the programs' structure, can only repair about 72% of the incorrect programs. In contrast, our approach, which is solely based on variable mappings, can repair around 88.5%.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this paper, we systematically study the quality of 4,066 ChatGPT-generated code implemented in two popular programming languages, i.e., Java and Python, for 2,033 programming tasks. The goal of this work is three folds. First, we analyze the correctness of ChatGPT on code generation tasks and uncover the factors that influence its effectiveness, including task difficulty, programming language, time that tasks are introduced, and program size. Second, we identify and characterize potential issues with the quality of ChatGPT-generated code. Last, we provide insights into how these issues can be mitigated. Experiments highlight that out of 4,066 programs generated by ChatGPT, 2,757 programs are deemed correct, 1,081 programs provide wrong outputs, and 177 programs contain compilation or runtime errors. Additionally, we further analyze other characteristics of the generated code through static analysis tools, such as code style and maintainability, and find that 1,933 ChatGPT-generated code snippets suffer from maintainability issues. Subsequently, we investigate ChatGPT's self-debugging ability and its interaction with static analysis tools to fix the errors uncovered in the previous step. Experiments suggest that ChatGPT can partially address these challenges, improving code quality by more than 20%, but there are still limitations and opportunities for improvement. Overall, our study provides valuable insights into the current limitations of ChatGPT and offers a roadmap for future research and development efforts to enhance the code generation capabilities of AI models like ChatGPT.

**ABSTRACT**  
With the increasing interconnection of smart devices, users often desire to adopt the same app on quite different devices for identical tasks, such as watching the same movies on both their smartphones and TV.   However, the significant differences in screen size, aspect ratio, and interaction styles make it challenging to adapt Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) across these devices.   Although there are millions of apps available on Google Play, only a few thousand are designed to support smart TV displays.   Existing techniques to map a mobile app GUI to a TV either adopt a responsive design, which struggles to bridge the substantial gap between phone and TV or use mirror apps for improved video display, which requires hardware support and extra engineering efforts.   Instead of developing another app for supporting TVs, we propose a semi-automated approach to generate corresponding adaptive TV GUIs, given the phone GUIs as the input.   Based on our empirical study of GUI pairs for TV and phone in existing apps, we synthesize a list of rules for grouping and classifying phone GUIs, converting them to TV GUIs, and generating dynamic TV layouts and source code for the TV display.   Our tool is not only beneficial to developers but also to GUI designers, who can further customize the generated GUIs for their TV app development.   An evaluation and user study demonstrate the accuracy of our generated GUIs and the usefulness of our tool.

**ABSTRACT**  
Software Engineering is an applied discipline and concepts are difficult to grasp only at a theoretical level alone. In the context of a project management course, we introduced and evaluated the use of software process simulation (SPS) based games for improving students' understanding of software development processes. The effects of the intervention were measured by evaluating the students' arguments for choosing a particular development process. The arguments were assessed with the Evidence-Based Reasoning framework, which was extended to assess the strength of an argument. The results indicate that students generally have difficulty providing strong arguments for their choice of process models. Nevertheless, the assessment indicates that the intervention of the SPS game had a positive impact on the students' arguments. Even though the illustrated argument assessment approach can be used to provide formative feedback to students, its use is rather costly and cannot be considered a replacement for traditional assessments.

**ABSTRACT**  
Static analysis tools are traditionally used to detect and flag programs that violate properties. We show that static analysis tools can also be used to perturb programs that satisfy a property to construct variants that violate the property. Using this insight we can construct paired data sets of unsafe-safe program pairs, and learn strategies to automatically repair property violations. We present a system called \sysname, which automatically repairs information flow vulnerabilities using this approach. Since information flow properties are non-local (both to check and repair), \sysname also introduces a novel domain specific language (DSL) and strategy learning algorithms for synthesizing non-local repairs. We use \sysname to synthesize strategies for repairing two types of information flow vulnerabilities, unvalidated dynamic calls and cross-site scripting, and show that \sysname successfully repairs several hundred vulnerabilities from open source {\sc JavaScript} repositories, outperforming neural baselines built using {\sc CodeT5} and {\sc Codex}.

**ABSTRACT**  
In the context of sixth-generation (6G) networks, where diverse network slices coexist, the adoption of AI-driven zero-touch management and orchestration (MANO) becomes crucial. However, ensuring the trustworthiness of AI black-boxes in real deployments is challenging. Explainable AI (XAI) tools can play a vital role in establishing transparency among the stakeholders in the slicing ecosystem. But there is a trade-off between AI performance and explainability, posing a dilemma for trustworthy 6G network slicing because the stakeholders require both highly performing AI models for efficient resource allocation and explainable decision-making to ensure fairness, accountability, and compliance. To balance this trade off and inspired by the closed loop automation and XAI methodologies, this paper presents a novel explanation-guided in-hoc federated learning (FL) approach where a constrained resource allocation model and an explainer exchange -- in a closed loop (CL) fashion -- soft attributions of the features as well as inference predictions to achieve a transparent 6G network slicing resource management in a RAN-Edge setup under non-independent identically distributed (non-IID) datasets. In particular, we quantitatively validate the faithfulness of the explanations via the so-called attribution-based confidence metric that is included as a constraint to guide the overall training process in the run-time FL optimization task. In this respect, Integrated-Gradient (IG) as well as Input $\times$ Gradient and SHAP are used to generate the attributions for our proposed in-hoc scheme, wherefore simulation results under different methods confirm its success in tackling the performance-explainability trade-off and its superiority over the unconstrained Integrated-Gradient post-hoc FL baseline.

**ABSTRACT**  
Semantic types are a more powerful and detailed way of describing data than atomic types such as strings or integers. They establish connections between columns and concepts from the real world, providing more nuanced and fine-grained information that can be useful for tasks such as automated data cleaning, schema matching, and data discovery. Existing deep learning models trained on large text corpora have been successful at performing single-column semantic type prediction for relational data. However, in this work, we propose an extension of the semantic type prediction problem to JSON data, labeling the types based on JSON Paths. Similar to columns in relational data, JSON Path is a query language that enables the navigation of complex JSON data structures by specifying the location and content of the elements. We use a graph neural network to comprehend the structural information within collections of JSON documents. Our model outperforms a state-of-the-art existing model in several cases. These results demonstrate the ability of our model to understand complex JSON data and its potential usage for JSON-related data processing tasks.

**ABSTRACT**  
This technical report describes the intersection of process mining and large language models (LLMs), specifically focusing on the abstraction of traditional and object-centric process mining artifacts into textual format. We introduce and explore various prompting strategies: direct answering, where the large language model directly addresses user queries; multi-prompt answering, which allows the model to incrementally build on the knowledge obtained through a series of prompts; and the generation of database queries, facilitating the validation of hypotheses against the original event log.   Our assessment considers two large language models, GPT-4 and Google's Bard, under various contextual scenarios across all prompting strategies. Results indicate that these models exhibit a robust understanding of key process mining abstractions, with notable proficiency in interpreting both declarative and procedural process models.   In addition, we find that both models demonstrate strong performance in the object-centric setting, which could significantly propel the advancement of the object-centric process mining discipline.   Additionally, these models display a noteworthy capacity to evaluate various concepts of fairness in process mining. This opens the door to more rapid and efficient assessments of the fairness of process mining event logs, which has significant implications for the field.   The integration of these large language models into process mining applications may open new avenues for exploration, innovation, and insight generation in the field.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this paper, a highly compact, low power (<10W), high frequency (2 MHz) isolated active clamp forward converter, comprising a coreless Printed Circuit Board-based transformer is proposed. To decrease the size of converter, high switching frequency is considered which lead to decrease in inductor, capacitor and transformer size. Highly switch loss due to hard switching is an important constraint of forward topology to increase frequency. In this paper, the active clamp circuit is added to forward topology to achieve zero voltage switching and decrease switching loss drastically. Due to zero voltage switching, the proposed converter can operate in high frequency. The principle of active clamp forward converter is described in this paper. Another constraint to increase the switching frequency of forward converter is transformer core losses. In this paper, coreless PCB-based transformer is proposed and implemented to be utilized in the structure of the active clamp forward converter. Instead of classic core-based transformer, using a PCB-based transformer as the power transmitter has increased the efficiency due to elimination of core hysteresis loss. The equivalent circuit, transfer function and input impedance of PCB-based coreless transformer are presented in high frequency. Finally, an experimental prototype of the active clamp forward converter which uses a coreless transformer is implemented. The experimental results of proposed converter are presented to evaluate the theoretical analysis and performance.

**ABSTRACT**  
The transition to a sustainable energy supply challenges the operation of electric power systems in manifold ways. Transmission grid loads increase as wind and solar power are often installed far away from the consumers. In extreme cases, system operators must intervene via countertrading or redispatch to ensure grid stability. In this article, we provide a data-driven analysis of congestion in the German transmission grid. We develop an explainable machine learning model to predict the volume of redispatch and countertrade on an hourly basis. The model reveals factors that drive or mitigate grid congestion and quantifies their impact. We show that, as expected, wind power generation is the main driver, but hydropower and cross-border electricity trading also play an essential role. Solar power, on the other hand, has no mitigating effect. Our results suggest that a change to the market design would alleviate congestion.

**ABSTRACT**  
Distributed infrastructures for computation and analytics are now evolving towards an interconnected ecosystem allowing complex scientific workflows to be executed across hybrid systems spanning from IoT Edge devices to Clouds, and sometimes to supercomputers (the Computing Continuum). Understanding the performance trade-offs of large-scale workflows deployed on such complex Edge-to-Cloud Continuum is challenging. To achieve this, one needs to systematically perform experiments, to enable their reproducibility and allow other researchers to replicate the study and the obtained conclusions on different infrastructures. This breaks down to the tedious process of reconciling the numerous experimental requirements and constraints with low-level infrastructure design choices.To address the limitations of the main state-of-the-art approaches for distributed, collaborative experimentation, such as Google Colab, Kaggle, and Code Ocean, we propose KheOps, a collaborative environment specifically designed to enable cost-effective reproducibility and replicability of Edge-to-Cloud experiments. KheOps is composed of three core elements: (1) an experiment repository; (2) a notebook environment; and (3) a multi-platform experiment methodology.We illustrate KheOps with a real-life Edge-to-Cloud application. The evaluations explore the point of view of the authors of an experiment described in an article (who aim to make their experiments reproducible) and the perspective of their readers (who aim to replicate the experiment). The results show how KheOps helps authors to systematically perform repeatable and reproducible experiments on the Grid5000 + FIT IoT LAB testbeds. Furthermore, KheOps helps readers to cost-effectively replicate authors experiments in different infrastructures such as Chameleon Cloud + CHI@Edge testbeds, and obtain the same conclusions with high accuracies (> 88% for all performance metrics).

**ABSTRACT**  
In the field of Computer Science, conference and workshop papers serve as important contributions, carrying substantial weight in research assessment processes, compared to other disciplines. However, a considerable number of these papers are not assigned a Digital Object Identifier (DOI), hence their citations are not reported in widely used citation datasets like OpenCitations and Crossref, raising limitations to citation analysis. While the Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG) previously addressed this issue by providing substantial coverage, its discontinuation has created a void in available data. BIP! NDR aims to alleviate this issue and enhance the research assessment processes within the field of Computer Science. To accomplish this, it leverages a workflow that identifies and retrieves Open Science papers lacking DOIs from the DBLP Corpus, and by performing text analysis, it extracts citation information directly from their full text. The current version of the dataset contains more than 510K citations made by approximately 60K open access Computer Science conference or workshop papers that, according to DBLP, do not have a DOI.

**ABSTRACT**  
Although frame-based models, such as CTC and transducers, have an affinity for streaming automatic speech recognition, their decoding uses no future knowledge, which could lead to incorrect pruning. Conversely, label-based attention encoder-decoder mitigates this issue using soft attention to the input, while it tends to overestimate labels biased towards its training domain, unlike CTC. We exploit these complementary attributes and propose to integrate the frame- and label-synchronous (F-/L-Sync) decoding alternately performed within a single beam-search scheme. F-Sync decoding leads the decoding for block-wise processing, while L-Sync decoding provides the prioritized hypotheses using look-ahead future frames within a block. We maintain the hypotheses from both decoding methods to perform effective pruning. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed search algorithm achieves lower error rates compared to the other search methods, while being robust against out-of-domain situations.

**ABSTRACT**  
Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems often struggle with transcribing child speech due to the lack of large child speech datasets required to accurately train child-friendly ASR models. However, there are huge amounts of annotated adult speech datasets which were used to create multilingual ASR models, such as Whisper. Our work aims to explore whether such models can be adapted to child speech to improve ASR for children. In addition, we compare Whisper child-adaptations with finetuned self-supervised models, such as wav2vec2. We demonstrate that finetuning Whisper on child speech yields significant improvements in ASR performance on child speech, compared to non finetuned Whisper models. Additionally, utilizing self-supervised Wav2vec2 models that have been finetuned on child speech outperforms Whisper finetuning.

**ABSTRACT**  
Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) have emerged as powerful algorithms for processing heterogeneous graphs (HetGs), widely used in many critical fields. To capture both structural and semantic information in HetGs, HGNNs first aggregate the neighboring feature vectors for each vertex in each semantic graph and then fuse the aggregated results across all semantic graphs for each vertex. Unfortunately, existing graph neural network accelerators are ill-suited to accelerate HGNNs. This is because they fail to efficiently tackle the specific execution patterns and exploit the high-degree parallelism as well as data reusability inside and across the processing of semantic graphs in HGNNs.   In this work, we first quantitatively characterize a set of representative HGNN models on GPU to disclose the execution bound of each stage, inter-semantic-graph parallelism, and inter-semantic-graph data reusability in HGNNs. Guided by our findings, we propose a high-performance HGNN accelerator, HiHGNN, to alleviate the execution bound and exploit the newfound parallelism and data reusability in HGNNs. Specifically, we first propose a bound-aware stage-fusion methodology that tailors to HGNN acceleration, to fuse and pipeline the execution stages being aware of their execution bounds. Second, we design an independency-aware parallel execution design to exploit the inter-semantic-graph parallelism. Finally, we present a similarity-aware execution scheduling to exploit the inter-semantic-graph data reusability. Compared to the state-of-the-art software framework running on NVIDIA GPU T4 and GPU A100, HiHGNN respectively achieves an average 41.5$\times$ and 8.6$\times$ speedup as well as 106$\times$ and 73$\times$ energy efficiency with quarter the memory bandwidth of GPU A100.

**ABSTRACT**  
Neuromodulation techniques have emerged as promising approaches for treating a wide range of neurological disorders, precisely delivering electrical stimulation to modulate abnormal neuronal activity. While leveraging the unique capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) holds immense potential for responsive neurostimulation, it appears as an extremely challenging proposition where real-time (low-latency) processing, low power consumption, and heat constraints are limiting factors. The use of sophisticated AI-driven models for personalized neurostimulation depends on back-telemetry of data to external systems (e.g. cloud-based medical mesosystems and ecosystems). While this can be a solution, integrating continuous learning within implantable neuromodulation devices for several applications, such as seizure prediction in epilepsy, is an open question. We believe neuromorphic architectures hold an outstanding potential to open new avenues for sophisticated on-chip analysis of neural signals and AI-driven personalized treatments. With more than three orders of magnitude reduction in the total data required for data processing and feature extraction, the high power- and memory-efficiency of neuromorphic computing to hardware-firmware co-design can be considered as the solution-in-the-making to resource-constraint implantable neuromodulation systems. This could lead to a new breed of closed-loop responsive and personalised feedback, which we describe as Neuromorphic Neuromodulation. This can empower precise and adaptive modulation strategies by integrating neuromorphic AI as tightly as possible to the site of the sensors and stimulators. This paper presents a perspective on the potential of Neuromorphic Neuromodulation, emphasizing its capacity to revolutionize implantable brain-machine microsystems and significantly improve patient-specificity.

**ABSTRACT**  
Keyword Spotting (KWS) models on embedded devices should adapt fast to new user-defined words without forgetting previous ones. Embedded devices have limited storage and computational resources, thus, they cannot save samples or update large models. We consider the setup of embedded online continual learning (EOCL), where KWS models with frozen backbone are trained to incrementally recognize new words from a non-repeated stream of samples, seen one at a time. To this end, we propose Temporal Aware Pooling (TAP) which constructs an enriched feature space computing high-order moments of speech features extracted by a pre-trained backbone. Our method, TAP-SLDA, updates a Gaussian model for each class on the enriched feature space to effectively use audio representations. In experimental analyses, TAP-SLDA outperforms competitors on several setups, backbones, and baselines, bringing a relative average gain of 11.3% on the GSC dataset.

**ABSTRACT**  
Recent advancement in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has produced large AI models, which become impractical for deployment in mobile devices. Model quantization is effective to produce compressed general-purpose models, however such models may only be deployed to a restricted sub-domain of interest. We show that ASR models can be personalized during quantization while relying on just a small set of unlabelled samples from the target domain. To this end, we propose myQASR, a mixed-precision quantization method that generates tailored quantization schemes for diverse users under any memory requirement with no fine-tuning. myQASR automatically evaluates the quantization sensitivity of network layers by analysing the full-precision activation values. We are then able to generate a personalised mixed-precision quantization scheme for any pre-determined memory budget. Results for large-scale ASR models show how myQASR improves performance for specific genders, languages, and speakers.

**ABSTRACT**  
Developing a practically-robust automatic speech recognition (ASR) is challenging since the model should not only maintain the original performance on clean samples, but also achieve consistent efficacy under small volume perturbations and large domain shifts. To address this problem, we propose a novel WavAugment Guided Phoneme Adversarial Training (wapat). wapat use adversarial examples in phoneme space as augmentation to make the model invariant to minor fluctuations in phoneme representation and preserve the performance on clean samples. In addition, wapat utilizes the phoneme representation of augmented samples to guide the generation of adversaries, which helps to find more stable and diverse gradient-directions, resulting in improved generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of wapat on End-to-end Speech Challenge Benchmark (ESB). Notably, SpeechLM-wapat outperforms the original model by 6.28% WER reduction on ESB, achieving the new state-of-the-art.

**ABSTRACT**  
Multimodal reasoning is a critical component in the pursuit of artificial intelligence systems that exhibit human-like intelligence, especially when tackling complex tasks. While the chain-of-thought (CoT) technique has gained considerable attention, the existing ScienceQA dataset, which focuses on multimodal scientific questions and explanations from elementary and high school textbooks, lacks a comprehensive evaluation of diverse approaches. To address this gap, we present COCO Multi-Modal Reasoning Dataset(COCO-MMRD), a novel dataset that encompasses an extensive collection of open-ended questions, rationales, and answers derived from the large object dataset COCO. Unlike previous datasets that rely on multiple-choice questions, our dataset pioneers the use of open-ended questions in the context of multimodal CoT, introducing a more challenging problem that effectively assesses the reasoning capability of CoT models. Through comprehensive evaluations and detailed analyses, we provide valuable insights and propose innovative techniques, including multi-hop cross-modal attention and sentence-level contrastive learning, to enhance the image and text encoders. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed dataset and techniques, offering novel perspectives for advancing multimodal reasoning.

**ABSTRACT**  
With ChatGPT as a representative, tons of companies have began to provide services based on large Transformers models. However, using such a service inevitably leak users' prompts to the model provider. Previous studies have studied secure inference for Transformer models using secure multiparty computation (MPC), where model parameters and clients' prompts are kept secret. Despite this, these frameworks are still limited in terms of model performance, efficiency, and deployment. To address these limitations, we propose framework PUMA to enable fast and secure Transformer model inference. Our framework designs high quality approximations for expensive functions, such as GeLU and Softmax, which significantly reduce the cost of secure inference while preserving the model performance. Additionally, we design secure Embedding and LayerNorm procedures that faithfully implement the desired functionality without undermining the Transformer architecture. PUMA is about 2x faster than the state-of-the-art MPC framework MPCFORMER(ICLR 2023) and has similar accuracy as plaintext models without fine-tuning (which the previous works failed to achieve).   One more thing, PUMA can evaluate LLaMA-7B in around 5 minutes to generate 1 token. To our best knowledge, this is the first time that a model with such a parameter size is able to be evaluated under MPC. PUMA has been open-sourced in the Github repository of SecretFlow-SPU.

**ABSTRACT**  
Many lattice-based crypstosystems employ ideal lattices for high efficiency. However, the additional algebraic structure of ideal lattices usually makes us worry about the security, and it is widely believed that the algebraic structure will help us solve the hard problems in ideal lattices more efficiently. In this paper, we study the additional algebraic structure of ideal lattices further and find that a given ideal lattice in some fixed polynomial ring can be embedded as an ideal in infinitely many different polynomial rings. We explicitly present all these polynomial rings for any given ideal lattice. The interesting phenomenon tells us that a single ideal lattice may have more abundant algebraic structures than we imagine, which will impact the security of corresponding crypstosystems. For example, it increases the difficulties to evaluate the security of crypstosystems based on ideal lattices, since it seems that we need consider all the polynomial rings that the given ideal lattices can be embedded into if we believe that the algebraic structure will contribute to solve the corresponding hard problem. It also inspires us a new method to solve the ideal lattice problems by embedding the given ideal lattice into another well-studied polynomial ring. As a by-product, we also introduce an efficient algorithm to identify if a given lattice is an ideal lattice or not.

**ABSTRACT**  
The advent of Web 3.0, underpinned by blockchain technologies, promises to transform the internet's landscape by empowering individuals with decentralized control over their data. However, this evolution brings unique security challenges that need to be addressed. This paper explores these complexities, focusing on enhancing privacy and anonymous auditing within blockchain structures. We present the architecture of Web 3.0 based on the blockchain, providing a clear perspective on its workflow and security mechanisms. A security protocol for Web 3.0 systems, employing privacy-preserving techniques and anonymous auditing during runtime, is proposed. Key components of our solution include the integration of privacy-enhancing techniques and the utilization of Tor for anonymous auditing. We discuss related work and propose a framework that meets these new security requirements. Lastly, we offer an evaluation and comparison of our model to existing methods. This research contributes towards the foundational understanding of Web 3.0's secure structure and offers a pathway towards secure and privacy-preserving digital interactions in this novel internet landscape.

**ABSTRACT**  
Fuzz drivers are a necessary component of API fuzzing. However, automatically generating correct and robust fuzz drivers is a difficult task. Compared to existing approaches, LLM-based (Large Language Model) generation is a promising direction due to its ability to operate with low requirements on consumer programs, leverage multiple dimensions of API usage information, and generate human-friendly output code. Nonetheless, the challenges and effectiveness of LLM-based fuzz driver generation remain unclear.   To address this, we conducted a study on the effects, challenges, and techniques of LLM-based fuzz driver generation. Our study involved building a quiz with 86 fuzz driver generation questions from 30 popular C projects, constructing precise effectiveness validation criteria for each question, and developing a framework for semi-automated evaluation. We designed five query strategies, evaluated 36,506 generated fuzz drivers. Furthermore, the drivers were compared with manually written ones to obtain practical insights. Our evaluation revealed that:   while the overall performance was promising (passing 91% of questions), there were still practical challenges in filtering out the ineffective fuzz drivers for large scale application; basic strategies achieved a decent correctness rate (53%), but struggled with complex API-specific usage questions. In such cases, example code snippets and iterative queries proved helpful; while LLM-generated drivers showed competent fuzzing outcomes compared to manually written ones, there was still significant room for improvement, such as incorporating semantic oracles for logical bugs detection.
