NetWalk: A flexible deep embedding approach for anomaly detection in dynamic networks.
Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining -2018, 2672–2681.
https://doi.org/10.1145/3219819.3220024 Abstract Massive and dynamic networks arise in many practical applications such as social media, security and public health. Given an evolutionary network, it is crucial to detect structural anomalies, such as vertices and edges whose “behaviors” deviate from underlying majority of the network, in a real-time fashion.</description></item><item><title>Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks: A Deep Learning Framework for Traffic Forecasting</title><link>https://akitenkrad.github.io/akitenkrad-blog/posts/papers/202209/20220909180827/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://akitenkrad.github.io/akitenkrad-blog/posts/papers/202209/20220909180827/</guid><description>Round-1: Overview Round-2: Model Implementation Details Round-3: Experiments Citation Yu, B., Yin, H., &amp;amp; Zhu, Z.

Spatio-temporal graph convolutional networks: A deep learning framework for traffic forecasting.
IJCAI International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 2018-July, 3634–3640.
https://doi.org/10.24963/IJCAI.2018/505 Abstract Timely accurate traffic forecast is crucial for ur-ban traffic control and guidance. Due to the highnonlinearity and complexity of traffic flow, tradi-tional methods cannot satisfy the requirements ofmid-and-long term prediction tasks and often ne-glect spatial and temporal dependencies.</description></item><item><title>High-order Proximity Preserved Embedding for Dynamic Networks</title><link>https://akitenkrad.github.io/akitenkrad-blog/posts/papers/202206/20220618223844/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://akitenkrad.github.io/akitenkrad-blog/posts/papers/202206/20220618223844/</guid><description>Round-1: Overview Round-2: Model Implementation Details Round-3: Experiments Citation Zhu, D., Cui, P., Zhang, Z., Pei, J., &amp;amp; Zhu, W.

High-Order Proximity Preserved Embedding for Dynamic Networks.
IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 30(11), 2134–2144.
https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2018.2822283 Abstract Network embedding, aiming to embed a network into a low dimensional vector space while preserving the inherent structural properties of the network, has attracted considerable attention. However, most existing embedding methods focus on the static network while neglecting the evolving characteristic of real-world networks.</description></item><item><title>S-Net: From Answer Extraction to Answer Generation for Machine Reading Comprehension</title><link>https://akitenkrad.github.io/akitenkrad-blog/posts/papers/202206/20220602171700/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://akitenkrad.github.io/akitenkrad-blog/posts/papers/202206/20220602171700/</guid><description>Round-1: Overview Round-2: Model Implementation Details Round-3: Experiments Citation Chuanqi Tan, Furu Wei, Nan Yang, Bowen Du,Weifeng Lv, and Ming Zhou. 2018.
S-Net: Fromanswer extraction to answer synthesis for machinereading comprehension.
InAssociation for the Ad-vancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), pages5940–5947. Abstract In this paper, we present a novel approach to machine reading comprehension forthe MS-MARCO dataset. Unlike the SQuAD dataset that aims to answer a ques-tion with exact text spans in a passage, the MS-MARCO dataset defines the taskas answering a question from multiple passages and the words in the answer arenot necessary in the passages.</description></item></channel></rss>
